Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with a different power of 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the inverse of the parallax (p), so d = 1/p. Oh right, that's the basic relationship.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, so it's like how many stars you'd expect to find in a range of parallax values. Let's think about this. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density is the same throughout space. So as we look further away (higher d), the same number of stars would cover a larger volume.

But wait, the question is specifically about the number per unit range of parallax. So maybe we need to find how the number of stars in a bin of parallax width δp depends on p.

Let me visualize this. Each star has a certain parallax. If we make a histogram of parallax, we're trying to see how the number of stars in each bin (which is a certain range of parallax) changes as a function of p.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let’s denote this number density as n. So the number of stars in a region is n multiplied by the volume of that region.

But how does the volume relate to parallax? Well, parallax p is inversely proportional to distance d. So as p increases, d decreases. Wait, no, no, higher p means closer distance. Because p = 1/d. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

Wait, let me clarify: The parallax formula p = 1/d (in parsecs). So if a star is closer (smaller d), p is larger. For example, d=1 pc, p=1 arcsec; d=2 pc, p=0.5 arcsec, etc.

So the parallax decreases as the distance increases. So when you're looking at a range of parallaxes from p to p + δp, you're looking at stars at a certain distance range.

But wait, the number of stars in a shell between d and d + δd is n * (4π d² δd). Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² δd. Since n is uniform, the number of stars is proportional to the surface area (4π d²) times the thickness δd.

Now, since p = 1/d, we can express d in terms of p: d = 1/p. So, δd = - (1/p²) δp. Wait, let me see: because d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So δd = - (1/p²) δp. But since δp is a positive quantity, we can take the magnitude.

So putting it all together, the number of stars in a parallax range dp is proportional to n * 4π d² δd. Substituting d=1/p and δd= (1/p²) δp (taking absolute value), we get:

N ∝ n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/(p²)) δp.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The number of stars in a shell between d and d+δd is N = n * 4π d² δd. And since δd = (1/p²) δp, substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) δp. Wait, no, no, because d = 1/p, so d² is (1/p²), and δd is (1/p²)*δp. So:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) δp? Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. N is the number of stars in the shell. The shell's volume is 4π d² δd. So in terms of p, since d = 1/p, then δd = - (1/p²) δp. So the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) δp. So that's 4π (1/p^4) δp.

But wait, that would make the number of stars N = n * 4π (1/p^4) δp. So the number per unit δp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but that's the number of stars per unit δp. So when parallax increases (p is larger), the number of stars in each δp bin decreases as 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me go through it methodically.

The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+δd is N = n * 4π d² δd.

We can express this in terms of p.

Since p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So, δd = - (1/p²) δp. But since δp is positive, we can take the magnitude.

So substituting d = 1/p into the expression:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) δp

Which is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) δp.

So the number of stars in a δp interval is N = (n * 4π) / p^4 * δp.

Which means the number of stars per unit δp is N/(δp) = (n *4π)/p^4.

So N per unit δp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the answer should be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait again. I'm a bit confused because elsewhere I've heard that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^3. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting δd. Let me see again.

The volume element is 4π d² δd. But when changing variables from d to p, since p = 1/d, δd in terms of δp is δd = - (1/p²) δp. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) δp = 4π (1/p^4) δp.

Wait, that's correct. So N = n * volume = n * 4π (1/p^4) δp.

So the number per unit δp is N / δp = 4π n / p^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, I think I remember that the number of stars with a parallax greater than p is proportional to 1/p^3. So maybe the cumulative distribution is 1/p^3, but here we're talking about the differential, which would be the derivative of that.

Wait, let's think about it. The cumulative number of stars with parallax less than p would be the integral from p=0 to p=p of the number per unit δp. So integrating dN/dp dp from 0 to p_max.

If dN/dp is proportional to 1/p^4, then integrating from 0 to p_max would give N(p_max) ∝ ∫ (1/p^4) dp from 0 to p_max, which is ∫ p^{-4} dp = [ -1/(3 p^3) ] from 0 to p_max. But that would give N(p_max) proportional to 1/(3 p_max^3), which suggests that the cumulative number of stars with parallax less than p_max is proportional to 1/p_max^3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the cumulative distribution (number of stars with p < p_max) is proportional to 1/p_max^3. So the differential, dN/dp, would be the derivative of that, which is d/dp (1/p^3) ) = -3 p^{-4}.

Which is again 1/p^4. So yes, the differential is 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So looking back at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the correct answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax \( p \) and distance \( d \), given by \( p = 1/d \). Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density \( n \) of stars is constant throughout space. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \delta d \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \delta d \), multiplied by the number density \( n \).

Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( p \) (\( d = 1/p \)) and \( \delta d \) in terms of \( \delta p \) (\( \delta d = -1/p^2 \delta p \)), the number of stars in a parallax range \( \delta p \) becomes:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \delta p = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} \delta p.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dN/dp \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \).

To confirm, consider the cumulative number of stars with parallax less than \( p \). This is obtained by integrating \( dN/dp \) over \( p \) from 0 to \( p \):

\[
N(p) \propto \int_0^p \frac{1}{p^4} dp = \left[-\frac{1}{3p^3}\right]_0^p \propto \frac{1}{p^3}.
\]

This cumulative distribution aligns with the known result that the number of stars with parallax less than \( p \) is proportional to \( 1/p^3 \), and its derivative gives \( dN/dp \propto 1/p^4 \).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \), corresponding to **Option A**.
