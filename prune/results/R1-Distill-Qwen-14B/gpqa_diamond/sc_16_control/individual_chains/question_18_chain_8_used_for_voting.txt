Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that the notation [X/Y]_star means the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of X to Y in the star compared to the Sun. So, for example, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

The question gives me some data:
- Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, [Fe/H]_1 = 0.
- Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, [Mg/H]_2 = 0.
- Sun's photosphere: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5, which is nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-4.7) because 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, wait, let me recheck that. The Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5=1e-5.

Wait, but in the Sun, I'm more familiar with the values, but perhaps I should just go with what the question gives.

So for the Sun:
nFe/H = 10^(-4.5) → nFe = (3.16e-5) * nH.
nMg/H = 1e-5 → nMg = 1e-5 * nH.

I need to find the ratio nSi/nH for both stars, then take the ratio (Star_1 / Star_2).

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)_sun → nFe/nH = same as Sun.

Which is 3.16e-5.

Wait, wait, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of the star's Fe abundance relative to H compared to the Sun's. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If [Fe/H] is 0, then nFe/nH in the star is equal to that in the Sun.

So in Star_1, the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the Sun.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So that's [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So log(nSi/nFe)_star1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But what's the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Wait, the Sun's data isn't given for Si, but perhaps we can compute it. Or maybe through other relations.

Wait, maybe I can express nSi in terms of nFe and then nH.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which means (nSi / nFe)_star1 = (nSi / nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But I don't know (nSi/nFe)_sun. Hmm, but perhaps I can get it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's data only gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but for Si, maybe I need to find it via other elements.

Wait, perhaps I can relate it through Mg and Si.

Wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 for Star_2. So for Star_2, (nMg/nSi)_star2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of nSi in the two stars.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But since [Fe/H] is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

But perhaps I can express nFe in terms of the Sun. Wait, maybe it's easier to use the same H count, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all ratios in terms of H.

In the Sun:
nFe_sun = (1e-4.5) * nH_sun.

Similarly, nMg_sun = (1e-5) * nH_sun.

But for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, that means that (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I don't know (nSi_sun / nFe_sun). Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can think about the solar abundance.

In the Sun, the ratio of Si to Fe is [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0? No, wait, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Wait no, no, wait: [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_sun. So if [X/Y]_star is 0, nX/nY is same as Sun.

But for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So log(nSi_star1/nFe_star1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But I don't have the solar [Si/Fe], so perhaps I can find it.

Wait, but the Sun's data gives us nFe and nMg, but not nSi. Hmm. Is there a way to find [Si/Fe]_sun? Maybe through other relations or maybe it's a given that it's zero. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun by using the [Mg/Si]_sun, but since that's not given, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Wait, perhaps I should instead express nSi in terms of nMg and then work through the two stars.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, then find the ratio between the two.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_1 and the solar [Si/Fe].

Wait, but without knowing the solar [Si/Fe], I can't proceed numerically. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero. No, that's not correct because I know that in the Sun, the abundance of Si is higher than Fe, but maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio.

Let's think about that.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1 =0, this is correct.

So [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1 / nH_1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

But since in the photosphere, the total number density is different between stars, but perhaps for the ratio, it's not necessary.

Wait, but perhaps I should express all elements in terms of H.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3 → because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) = 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3.

Wait, because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But if I can express nSi_1 as (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1) * 10^0.3.

Simplify: (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

Which is nSi_sun * 10^0.3 * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

So [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log( (nSi_sun *10^0.3 * nH_1 / nH_sun) / nH_1 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

= log( (nSi_sun *10^0.3) / nH_sun ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)

= log(10^0.3) = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → which means nSi_1 / nH_1 = nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0, then [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

Wait, no, because [X/Y] = [X/Z] - [Y/Z], where Z is a third element. Wait, no, that's only true if we have [X/Z] = [X/Y] + [Y/Z].

Because [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun.

So [X/Z] = [X/Y] + [Y/Z].

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1 → 0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

So that's the ratio for Star_1.

Now, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).

So let's compute [Mg/Si]_2.

nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH_2) ) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) )

Which is (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_2/nH_2).

But [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Hmm. Alternatively, rearrange to get nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2.

nSi_2 = nMg_2 * 10^(-0.3) / (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) )

Wait, not sure. Let me try a different approach.

Since [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, then (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).

So nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

Substituting into the earlier expression:

(nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2 ) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Rearranging for nSi2:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2 ) ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2) * (nMg_sun) / (nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun / (nMg_sun) )) / (10^0.3 )

The nMg_sun cancels out:

nSi2 = (nH2) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) / (10^0.3 )

Which can be written as:

nSi2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) * 10^(-0.3 )

Wait, but nH2 is the number of H in Star_2, and nH_sun is that in the Sun. So (nH2 / nH_sun) is a factor.

But how do I relate nH2 and nH1? Hmm, perhaps since the problem is asking for the ratio of nSi in Star_1 and Star_2, the H factors will cancel out.

Wait, because the ratio (nSi1/nH1) divided by (nSi2/nH2) would give:

(nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * (nH1/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^(-0.3) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ]

Wait, let me re-express that.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH1 * 10^0.3.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH2 / nH_sun) ) * 10^(-0.3).

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that: from earlier, nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) * 10^(-0.3) ?

No, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express nSi2.

From earlier steps:

nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3 ]

Which simplifies to:

nSi2 = (nH2) * (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun) ) * 10^(-0.3)

Simplify: (nH2) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) * 10^(-0.3 )

So nSi2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) * (nH2) ) * 10^(-0.3 )

So (nSi2) = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^(-0.3) ) * (nH2)

Now, the ratio of (nSi1 / nH1) to (nSi2 / nH2) is:

(nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^0.3 ) * (nH1/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^(-0.3) ) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ 10^0.3 * (nH1/nH_sun) ) ] / [ 10^(-0.3) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) ]

= 10^(0.3+0.3) * (nH1 / nH2 )

Wait, 10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3) = 10^(0.6).

So the ratio becomes 10^(0.6) * (nH1 / nH2 )

But wait, do I know anything about the ratio of H in the two stars? The problem doesn't give any information about the overall H content, so perhaps the ratio is 1? Or maybe the H doesn't matter because it's a ratio of abundances.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So that would be (nSi1 / nH1 ) divided by (nSi2 / nH2 ), multiplied by (nH2 / nH1 ), but perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of (nSi1 / nH1 ) : (nSi2 / nH2 ), which is the same as (nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) = [nSi1/nH1 ] * [nH2/nSi2 ].

But from earlier:

nSi1/nH1 = nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^0.3.

nSi2/nH2 = nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^(-0.3) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) * 1/(nH2) ) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Since the problem is about the ratio of the silicon abundances in the two stars, perhaps it would be easier to compute [Si/H] for both and then take the ratio.

For Star_1, as we found earlier, [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Now, for Star_2, let's find [Si/H]_2.

We have:
- [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.
- [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun).

So, from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have:

nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0,

nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2 /nH_sun).

So substituting into the first equation:

( nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) ) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun ] / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 )

nMg_sun cancels:

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3 )

So:

nSi2 = nSi_sun * (nH2 /nH_sun) / (10^0.3 )

But how does this relate to [Si/H]_2?

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)

Substituting nSi2:

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun * (nH2/nH_sun) ) / (10^0.3 ) ) / nH2

Simplify:

= (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )) * (nH2/nH_sun) ) / nH2

= (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )) * (1/nH_sun)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recompute.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )) * (nH2 / nH_sun )

So nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )) * (nH2 /nH_sun ) / nH2

= (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )) * (1/nH_sun )

So [Si/H]_2 = log( [nSi2/nH2 ] / [nSi_sun/nH_sun] )

= log( (nSi_sun/(10^0.3 nH_sun)) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) )

= log( 1/(10^0.3) )

= log(10^(-0.3)) = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^(-0.3).

So now, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is:

(nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^(-0.3)) ) ]

= 10^(0.3) / 10^(-0.3) ) = 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

So the ratio is about 3.9, so the answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Star}_1} = \log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Sun}} + 0.3 \)
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} \) in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Star}_2} = \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Sun}} + 0.3 \)
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} \) in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Sun's Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Sun}} = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Sun}} = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Star_1
For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Star}_1} = \log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Sun}} + 0.3 \).
- Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} \) in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} \) in Star_1 can be expressed as:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Star}_1} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]
- Therefore, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

### Step 2: Compute [Si/H] for Star_2
For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Star}_2} = \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Sun}} + 0.3 \).
- Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} \) in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Using the relationship:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{Star}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3},
  \]
  we solve for \( n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} \) in Star_2:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Star}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]
- Therefore, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\text{Star}_1}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\text{Star}_2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which is approximately 3.9.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is **~3.9**.
