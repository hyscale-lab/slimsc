Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem presents a density matrix ρ, given by (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space from the given options. The options are vectors in 3D space: A is (1,1,0), B is (0,0,1), C is all zeros, and D is (1,1,1).

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, this matrix looks familiar. Let me write it out in matrix form to visualize it better.

So, |0⟩ is the basis vector [1, 0] and |1⟩ is [0, 1]. The outer products would be:

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
|1⟩⟨1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]

Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiply by 1/2: so ρ is (1/2)*[[1,0],[0,1]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Wait, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Right, because a completely mixed state has equal probabilities for both states, so no coherence. So ρ is a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a qubit state is represented as r = (x, y, z), where the components correspond to the parameters in the density matrix. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me write out the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, if ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then each component of r corresponds to the coefficients in front of the Pauli matrices.

In our case, ρ is (I)/2, because the given density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is (I)/2. That implies that the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

So the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to look at this: for a density matrix, the Bloch vector can be found by ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if I compare:

Given ρ = (I)/2, that means all the r_x, r_y, r_z terms are zero. So yes, r is (0,0,0). 

So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which has no coherence and equal probabilities for both the \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) states.

To determine the geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma},
\]

where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given density matrix, we see that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that all components of the Bloch vector (\(r_x\), \(r_y\), \(r_z\)) are zero. Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.
