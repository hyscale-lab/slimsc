Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I need to find the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator Ay. Let's see what I remember.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given as c multiplied by a matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I guess S is a Pauli matrix or something similar.

Wait, the Pauli matrices usually have a factor of i in some places. Let me write down the matrix S. So S is:

[  0  -i ]
[  i   0 ]

I think that's sigma_y, but wait, sigma_y is usually [0 -i, i 0], so yeah, that's correct.

Since Ay is c times S, so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, no, c is h/(4π), so the matrix Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So the matrix becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ 0   -i ]
                 [ i    0 ]

Hmm, but wait, when dealing with angular momentum operators, I remember that the eigenvalues of these operators are related to the spin components. For spin-1/2 particles like the muon, the eigenvalues for S_y would be ±ħ/2. Oh wait, but here we have Ay = c S, where c = h/(4π), and S is sigma_y (times ħ/2?), maybe? Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, the spin matrices S are usually (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait no, the Pauli matrices are in units where ħ=2, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

The operator S here is given as the matrix S, which is [ [0,-i],[i,0] ]. So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times this matrix. Alternatively, perhaps S is already scaled with some factors.

Wait, let me think about the units. Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues of S are ±1 because S is a Pauli matrix. So then, the eigenvalues a of Ay would be c * (±1), since Ay = c * S.

Wait, so c is h/(4π). So a = (h/(4π)) * (±1), which gives a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but the options don't directly mention that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are real, which they are for Hermitian operators, but wait, S is Hermitian? Let me check.

Wait, S here is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Let me compute its conjugate transpose. The conjugate of S would have the first row [0, i], second row [-i, 0]. Wait, no, because in the original S, the elements are [0, -i] in first row and [i, 0] in second. Conjugate transpose (which is the adjoint) would swap and conjugate. So the adjoint of the first row [0, -i] is [0, i] as the first column. Similarly, the second row [i, 0] becomes [ -i, 0 ] as the second column. So the adjoint is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. But the original S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the negative of the adjoint. So S is anti-Hermitian? Or is Hermitian? Wait, for S to be Hermitian, S should equal its adjoint. Let me compute S† (dagger):

S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Compare with S: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† is equal to -S. So S is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian.

Wait, that's interesting. Because if S is anti-Hermitian, then S† = -S. So S^2 would be (-S) S = -S^2, so S^2 = 0? Wait, no, that can't be right because S^2 is the identity matrix when multiplied by i. Wait, let me compute S squared:

S squared is:

[0   -i] [0   -i]   = 
[ i    0] [i    0]

First element (1,1): 0*0 + (-i)*i = 0 + (-i^2) = 0 + (-(-1)) = 1.
(1,2) element: 0*(-i) + (-i)*0 = 0 + 0 = 0.
(2,1): i*0 + 0*i = 0 + 0 = 0.
(2,2): i*(-i) + 0 *0 = -i^2 = 1.
Wait, so S^2 is identity matrix. So S^2 = I. So S is a unitary matrix.

But back to eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of S must satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ=±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay = c S are c * (±1) → a = ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but the matrix Ay is not Hermitian because S is anti-Hermitian. So Ay would be anti-Hermitian. Wait, because c is real, so Ay† = c (S†) = c (-S) = - c S = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian. That's a bit confusing, but I think I should proceed.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is anti-Hermitian, its eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Because for an anti-Hermitian operator, eigenvalues are imaginary. Because, assuming ψ is an eigenvector, A ψ = a ψ. Taking the dagger, ψ† A† = a* ψ†. But A† = -A, so ψ† (-A) = a* ψ†. Then, multiply both sides by ψ: (ψ† (-A) ψ) = a* (ψ† ψ). But A ψ = a ψ → ψ† A ψ = a ψ† ψ. So, combining these, we get - a ψ† ψ = a* ψ† ψ. So -a = a*. Which implies a is purely imaginary.

Wait, but wait, in our case, Ay is c S, and c is real, so a would have to be purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues of Ay are imaginary numbers. But looking at the options, they're talking about the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. Wait, but the eigenvalues of an anti-Hermitian operator are purely imaginary. So their real parts would be zero.

Wait, that's conflicting with the options given. Because the options, A and B, talk about the real and imaginary parts as both non-zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in determining whether Ay is Hermitian or not.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express S as a Hermitian matrix. Let me check again. Since S is [[0, -i], [i,0]], its conjugate transpose is [[0,i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing this to S, it's not the same, but S is equal to -S†. So S is anti-Hermitian. So Ay is c times S; c is real. So Ay is anti-Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

But in the options, the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts. So perhaps none of the options A or B are correct because they imply the eigenvalues are complex numbers with non-zero real parts, which can't be the case for an anti-Hermitian operator.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

We can write Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ 0   -i ]
                [ i    0 ]

So the matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by (h/(4π)). Let's call this matrix M, so M = Ay.

To find eigenvalues, solve det(M - a I) = 0.

So,

| -a      (-i h/(4π)) |
| (i h/(4π))   -a    | = 0

The determinant is (a^2) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

Compute the product: (-i) * (i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²/(16 π²)) * 1.

So determinant is a^2 - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a^2 = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, but I thought the eigenvalues were purely imaginary because Ay is anti-Hermitian. But according to this, a is real. That's a contradiction. So where am I wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the determinant.

The matrix M - a I is:

[ -a       (-i c) ]
[ i c      -a    ]

Where c = h/(4π)

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c) * (i c) )

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ]

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = 1. So it's a² - (1 * c² ) = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So a is real. But wait, that can't be right because Ay is anti-Hermitian, and its eigenvalues should be imaginary. Hmm, this is confusing. I must have made a mistake in determining whether Ay is Hermitian or not.

Wait, let's compute Ay†. Since S is anti-Hermitian, S† = - S. So Ay = c S, so Ay† = c S† = c (-S) = -c S = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be purely imaginary.

But according to the determinant, the eigenvalues are real. That's conflicting. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is actually Hermitian. Let me check again. S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Then S† is [[0,i],[-i,0]].

Wait, S is equal to -S† because:

- S† = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is S. So S = - S† → S is anti-Hermitian.

So Ay is anti-Hermitian, so eigenvalues should be imaginary. So why is the determinant giving me real eigenvalues?

Ah, perhaps because I'm using a real value for 'a' in the equation. That must be the mistake. Let me write the equation correctly. The eigenvalues a must be such that a is purely imaginary.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is (M - a I) ψ = 0. So M is a real multiple of S, which is anti-Hermitian. Let me make a substitution. Since a is imaginary, let a = i b, where b is real.

So the equation becomes:

a² = (i b)^2 = - b² = c² → -b² = c² → b² = -c².

Wait, that can't be possible because c is real. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made an error in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps S is Hermitian. Wait, let me re-calculate S's Hermiticity. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is the same as -S because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† = -S → S is anti-Hermitian. So Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian.

But according to the determinant, the eigenvalues are real, which is conflicting. That suggests a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the definition of the spin operator. Let me recall that the spin matrices S_x, S_y, S_z are Hermitian and have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So perhaps the matrix S here is actually Hermitian, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S given is actually (i times the Pauli matrix). Let me think: The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as S here. Oh wait, yes, so S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y, which is Hermitian. Wait, because sigma_y is Hermitian.

Wait, let me check that. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is the same as the original matrix. So sigma_y is Hermitian. Wait, why did I think earlier that S is anti-Hermitian? Let me compute S† again.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the conjugate of each element: 0's stay same, -i becomes i, i becomes -i. Then transpose the matrix: swap (1,2) and (2,1) elements. So the (1,2) element is i, and (2,1) is -i.

So S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Wait, that's the same as S? No, because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† is [[0, i], [-i,0]], which equals S because the original matrix has (1,2) as -i, but S† has (1,2) as i. So that's not the same. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

No, wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† is the conjugate transpose, which would have the first row as [0, i], and the second as [-i, 0]. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing to S, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], they are not the same. So S is not Hermitian. So S is anti-Hermitian because S† = -S.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So maybe I'm confusing the definition. Let me re-examine the Pauli matrices.

The Pauli Y matrix is defined as:

sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Yes, which is the same as S here. So sigma_y is Hermitian. Because sigma_y† = sigma_y. Wait, let me compute sigma_y†:

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

sigma_y† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is the same as sigma_y? No, no. Because [0, i] and [-i, 0] are the first and second rows. So sigma_y is equal to its own dagger? Let me compute:

sigma_y = [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

sigma_y† = [[0, i], [-i,0]]

But sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], which is not the same as sigma_y†. So sigma_y is not Hermitian. Wait, that can't be right, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So something's wrong here. Maybe I have the definition of sigma_y wrong. No, the sigma_y matrix is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as -sigma_y.

So sigma_y† = - sigma_y → sigma_y is anti-Hermitian. That's conflicting with what I remember. So what's the issue here?

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from different conventions. Because the Pauli matrices are known to be Hermitian. Let me check with a different approach.

Compute sigma_y†:

Each element (i,j) becomes the complex conjugate of sigma_y's (j,i) element.

sigma_y is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So sigma_y† would be:

Column 1 becomes row 1: 0, i
Column 2 becomes row 2: -i, 0

Which is:

Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

Which is the same as - sigma_y because:

- sigma_y is:

Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

Yes, exactly. So sigma_y† = - sigma_y. Therefore, sigma_y is anti-Hermitian. But that contradicts what I thought before because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps sigma_y is Hermitian. Let me recalculate sigma_y†.

sigma_y [[0, -i],[i,0]]

Conjugate each element:

0 → 0
-i → i
i → -i
0 → 0.

Then transpose the matrix:

The (1,2) element of sigma_y is -i, so in sigma_y†, it's at (2,1) as the conjugate, which is i.

Similarly, (2,1) element is i, becomes (1,2) as -i.

So sigma_y† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is indeed equal to sigma_y's negative:

Because sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so -sigma_y is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which equals sigma_y†. So sigma_y is anti-Hermitian.

Hmm, but that's conflicting with what I remember. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the matrix S is actually Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition. Let me check another source. Ok, according to the standard definition, sigma_y is:

σy = [[0, −i],
       [i,  0]]

Which is the same as our S. And sigma_y is Hermitian? Let me compute sigma_y^†.

sigma_y^†:

Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

But sigma_y is:

Row 1:0, -i
Row 2:i, 0

So sigma_y^† is not equal to sigma_y, which suggests that sigma_y is not Hermitian. But that's in contradiction with what I know.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that sigma_y is Hermitian. Let me compute sigma_y^2.

sigma_y^2 = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by itself.

Which gives:

(0 * 0 + (-i)*i) → 0 + (-i^2) → 0 + 1 = 1 → (1,1) element is 1.

(0 * (-i) + (-i) * 0) → 0 → (1,2) element is 0.

( i * 0 + 0 * i ) → 0 → (2,1) is 0.

( i*(-i) + 0*0 ) → -i^2 = 1 → (2,2) is 1.

So sigma_y^2 is identity matrix. So sigma_y is a Hermitian matrix only if sigma_y^† = sigma_y. But earlier calculation shows that sigma_y^† is - sigma_y. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conjugate transpose. Let me compute sigma_y^† again.

sigma_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0.

Conjugate transpose, we take the transpose and conjugate each element.

Transposing sigma_y:

Column 1 becomes row 1: 0, i → [0, i]
Column 2 becomes row 2: -i, 0 → [-i, 0]

So sigma_y^† is:

[ 0, i
  -i, 0 ]

Which is equal to sigma_y's negative because sigma_y is:

[ 0, -i
  i, 0 ]

So sigma_y^† is equal to -sigma_y → so sigma_y is anti-Hermitian. Hence, sigma_y is not Hermitian. That's conflicting with what I thought I knew about Pauli matrices.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the definition of S is different. Because I thought that Pauli matrices are Hermitian, but according to this calculation, sigma_y is anti-Hermitian. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S given in the problem is actually Hermitian. Let me reevaluate.

Given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], is S Hermitian?

Compute S†: [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Compare to S: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S† is not equal to S. So S is not Hermitian. So I'm confident that S is anti-Hermitian.

Thus, Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be purely imaginary.

So when I computed the determinant and found a^2 = c^2 → a = ±c, but that suggests real eigenvalues, which contradicts the anti-Hermitian property.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express the determinant with a being purely imaginary. Let me write a = i b, where b is real.

So the equation is a^2 = (i b)^2 = - b^2 = c^2 → -b^2 = c^2 → b^2 = - c^2.

But c is a real number (c = h/(4π)), so the right-hand side is negative. But the left-hand side is a square of real number, which is non-negative. So this is impossible. Therefore, my earlier calculation must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that the operator Ay is not S multiplied by c. Wait, looking back, the problem says Ay = c · S, where c = h/(4π). So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Since S is anti-Hermitian, S² = I. Because S² = [[0, -i],[i, 0]]^2 = [[1,0],[0,1]] = I.

So S² = I.

So for Ay, which is c S, we have (Ay)^2 = c^2 S^2 = c^2 I.

So the square of the operator Ay is c^2 times the identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of Ay squared would be c^2, and since Ay is anti-Hermitian, the eigenvalues of Ay must satisfy a^2 = c^2 → a = ±i c.

Wait, but wait, if a is an eigenvalue of Ay, then a^2 is an eigenvalue of Ay squared, which is c^2 I. So a^2 = c^2 → a = ±i c.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ±i c, which are purely imaginary.

Wait, that makes sense. So in that case, the eigenvalues are ±i c, where c = h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). So the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π).

Looking back at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the real parts would be zero.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts are ±1. That also doesn't fit because the real parts are zero.

Hmm, so neither option A nor B seems correct. So perhaps the correct statement is elsewhere.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Well, A^2 would be the square of the angular momentum operator. Since for spin systems, the eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S^2, but not of S_z. Because S^2 commutes with S_y, so they share eigenfunctions. But S_z does not commute with S_y, so eigenfunctions are different. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay (S_y), then it's also an eigenfunction of A^2 (since A^2 = c^2 S^2, and S^2 is the same for all spin components, so commutes with S_y). So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions would typically be the eigenvectors of the matrix. So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is correct. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if they are distinct) form a basis. So D's statement is correct.

So now, I have to choose between options C and D.

Now, let's think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum operator, which commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay will also be eigenfunctions of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0. So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since [Ay, Az] is non-zero (they don't commute), the eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the space, so D is correct. Because any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors, so they form a basis.

Wait, but wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So the options are about what is correct during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, in the calculation, we're solving Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors φ will form a basis for the space. So statement D is correct. Also, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So statement C is correct.

Wait, but the options are multiple-choice, and only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, which is correct?

In any case, let me think about each option.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, and assuming that it has two linearly independent eigenvectors, which it does in this case (since it's a Pauli matrix, which has two distinct eigenvalues), the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But let me think: the matrix Ay is 2x2, and if it's diagonalizable, which it is (as it's a Pauli matrix), then its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So both options C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the problem is about the calculation. So during the calculation, which statement would you consider correct.

So for option D, statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

But what about option C?

In the calculation, when you find the eigenfunctions of Ay, you can also find that they are eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Which is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, I have to choose one.

Wait, the question says "which statement below will you consider to be correct".

Looking at the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions of the matrix operator? Not sure if that's the correct wording. Because the basis functions are the eigenvectors of the operator, which are the basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But let me think about the options again.

Wait, the problem statement says that the matrix S is given, and Ay is c S.

So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

The eigenvalues are a = ± i c, which are imaginary, and the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of S. So the real parts are zero.

So looking back at the options.

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). No, since h/(4π) is real, the imaginary parts would be ±h/(4π), but the real parts are zero.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. That would require c = 1/2, but c is h/(4π).

So option B is incorrect.

Options C and D.

So, the correct statements are options C and D.

But perhaps the correct answer is D. Because during the calculation, the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Because a matrix operator acts on a vector space, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is true, and not of Az, which is also true. So option C is correct.

So which option is correct?

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, during the calculation, when I find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, I find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So option C is correct.

Another point: Az is the Z-component of angular momentum. The operator Az is S_z multiplied by c.

Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, which makes option C correct.

So the correct statement is option C.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So the first part of C is correct.

So, I think option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Nature of \( S \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is anti-Hermitian (\( S^\dagger = -S \)).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), \( A_y \) is also anti-Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as \( S^2 = I \).
   - Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( a = \pm i c = \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - The eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with no real part.

3. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space since \( A_y \) is a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues.
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (\( [A_y, A^2] = 0 \)).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (\( A^z \)) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] \neq 0 \)).

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary (\( \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and the real parts are zero.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \), but not with \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, the phrasing of this option is less precise than Option C, which directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).
