Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, each representing a different symmetry group. I remember that molecular symmetry groups are classified based on the types of symmetry operations they possess, like rotations, reflections, etc.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe B is something that reacts in a molar ratio of 1:8 with A. Wait, no, wait. The way it's written is "8 equivalents of gas B." So if it's 8 equivalents, maybe each mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. Or perhaps the formula is something like A + 8B → C.

The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So that's C + 2D → E.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G.

Lastly, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H.

I think I need to figure out what substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are. Once I know E, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me think about common reactions. The first reaction: solid A reacting with gas B in a 1:8 ratio. What solid reacts with a gas in such a way? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else? Or perhaps it's a metal reacting with a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving a transition metal and a halogen.

Wait, another thought: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of compounds like copper(II) sulfate solution being blue, but wait, maybe a different red compound. Oh, I remember that lead(II,IV) oxide is red. Or perhaps it's a different kind of compound.

Wait, another possibility: could this be a reaction involving dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) which is a gas, but that might not fit. Alternatively, could B be a diatomic gas like O2 or something else?

Wait, the product C is used in the second reaction with D. Let me think about the possible structure of E. If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's a highly toxic gas or a dangerous compound. For example, sarin gas is extremely hazardous, but that's more about organophosphates. Alternatively, maybe a cyanide compound or something like that.

Wait, another approach: think about the reaction where C reacts with water to form A and two acids. So C plus water gives A plus F and G. Let me think about possible C that, when hydrolyzed, gives two acids. Maybe something like a sulfite or nitrite or another salt.

Wait, suppose C is a metal oxide. If C is something like CuO, then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids, unless it's a carbonate. Wait, but if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then reacting with water would not change much. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, maybe it's more about an acidic solution. Hmm, but that's not directly giving two acids.

Alternatively, think about the reaction of a nitride. Nitrides might react with water to produce NH3 and another acid. Or perhaps, wait, maybe C is something like a sulfonate ester, but that seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B. If B is O2, then perhaps A is something like sodium (Na), but sodium reacting with O2 would form NaO2? Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, not sure if that's 8 equivalents. Or another metal.

Wait, another angle: in the first reaction, solid A plus 8 moles of gas B → C. Let's think about the possible stoichiometry. If A is, say, Fe, and B is Cl2, then Fe + Cl2 could form FeCl3, but the stoichiometry would be 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. That's not 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2, and A is something like an oxide. Wait, but if A is an oxide, and B is H2, then the reaction could be something like Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and H2O. Not sure.

Wait, another product C is bright red. Maybe it's lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4, which is red. But how would that form from a reaction with 8 equivalents of a gas.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of compound. What about a reaction where a metal reacts with a gas to form an oxide. For example, perhaps A is copper metal, and B is oxygen. Copper burns in oxygen to form CuO, but the stoichiometry isn't 1:8. Wait, Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. That's a 2:1 ratio of Cu to O2, not 8.

Alternatively, maybe B is a halogen. So if A is a metal, and B is Cl2, for example.

Wait, let me think about the other reactions. When C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio, to form E. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents are things like H2O, ethanol, etc.

Wait, D reacts with B (gas) to form H, which is a solvent. So D could be something that reacts with B to form a common solvent. For example, maybe D is H2O and B is something else, but H would be... Hmm, maybe D is H2O and B is something like O2? No, O2 is a gas, but D reacting with B (O2) would be H2O + O2 → maybe Ozone? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. If D is H2O, and B is NH3 (a gas), then H could be something like NH4OH, but that's not a solvent I'm familiar with. Alternatively, B could be NaOH, but that's a solid, not a gas.

Wait, perhaps H is something like H2O. No, because D and B are reactants, and H is a solvent. Maybe H is ethanol, but how would D and B form ethanol? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. Let me think: D + B → H, which is a solvent. So if H is ethanol (CH3CH2OH), then D and B would be... maybe D is CH3CH2ONa (sodium ethoxide) and B is H2O. But wait, sodium ethoxide is a solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like H2O, but then D and B must form H2O. So maybe D is O2 and B is H2. Then H would be H2O, a solvent. That makes sense. So D is O2 and B is H2? But wait, in the first reaction, B is a gas reacting with solid A to form C. If B is H2, what's A?

Wait, let's try to re-examine the reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent)

So, in reaction 4, B and D are both gases, and they form H, a solvent.

If H is H2O, then B + D → H2O. So what gases B and D could react to form H2O? Possibilities: H2 and O2 → H2O, but that's a very slow reaction without a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe another combination. For example, NH3 and HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, but H here is a solvent, so that's not matching.

Wait, maybe H is another solvent like ethanol. But I'm not sure how that would form from B and D.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. Let's think of another common solvent. Maybe DCM (dichloromethane), but that would require D and B to be chlorinated compounds.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like methanol. So D and B could be CO and something else? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. What acids are strong and weak? Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4. Weak acids include CH3COOH, HNO2, H3PO4, etc.

If C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, gives a strong and a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfite or something else. Wait, maybe C is a nitride? For example, if C is Ca3N2, then reacting with water gives NH3 (which is a weak acid in water, but it's a base), and something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is something like Mg3N2, then Mg(OH)2 would form, but that's a base too. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a dinitride or similar. Wait, perhaps C is a nitride of a metal that reacts with water to produce NH3 and another acid. Let me think: for example, if C is CaN3, upon hydrolysis, it might produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say A is Na, B is CO2, and C is Na2CO3. Then, Na2CO3 reacting with H2O would give NaOH and CO2, but that's not two different acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is a metal sulfide, then reacting with water could produce H2S (a weak acid, but actually a weak base in water) and a metal hydroxide. Hmm, that doesn't fit because F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Like, for example, if C is a nitrate and a sulfate. So when it reacts with water, it dissociates into a strong acid and a weak acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Let's say, for instance, C is a sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). When it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) but that's not a strong acid. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a nitride, and when it reacts with water, it produces ammonia (NH3, which is a weak base) and another acid. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, Na3PO4. When it reacts with water, it would produce NaOH and PO4^3- which is a weak acid. But again, doesn't produce two different acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a highly toxic gas. For example, HCN (hydrogen cyanide) is very toxic, but how would that form?

Wait, if C is a cyanide salt, and D is H2O, but that's not matching the reaction. Alternatively, C could be a cyanide and D is something else. Or perhaps C is a sulfide and D is something, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction where D and B combine to form H, which is a solvent. If H is a common solvent like ethanol, then perhaps D is something like O2 and B is something else. Or maybe D is H2O and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps H is a diethyl ether? No, that would require D and B to be something like ethanol and sulfuric acid, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like H2O. So if D is O2 and B is H2, then H would be H2O. But the reaction of H2 and O2 to form H2O is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, but that's a slow reaction without a catalyst. So maybe that's possible.

If that's the case, then D is O2 and B is H2. So in reaction 4, B (H2) and D (O2) react to form H2O (H), which is a solvent.

Then, looking back at reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C. So A + 8 H2 → C.

What solid reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio? That's a lot. Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that reacts with H2 to form a hydride. For example, maybe A is iron, and the reaction forms FeH2? But I'm not sure about that. Or perhaps it's a metal oxide reacting with H2, but that would form metal and water, which isn't C.

Wait, another possibility: A could be a metal that forms a complex with H2. Or maybe it's an oxide reacting with H2 to form a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that when reacts with H2 in a certain condition forms a metal hydride. For example, sodium reacts with H2 to form NaH. But the stoichiometry would be Na + H2 → NaH + H2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfonate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a carbonate, but I don't think that would produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different angle. Let's think about E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → E. E is extremely hazardous. What compounds form from C and O2?

Wait, could E be SO3, which is a toxic gas? Or maybe it's NO2, which is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2O7, which is a highly toxic and dangerous compound.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a nerve agent, but that's more of a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure what C would be in that case.

Wait, perhaps E is something like H2SO4, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but then what would be the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic oxide, like carbon monoxide (CO), but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but ozone is formed from O2 under certain conditions. So if C is O3, then how would that form?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about possible E candidates. Extremely hazardous products could include things like sarin, VX, mustard gas, etc., but I don't know the exact reactions for those.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas such as HCN. So if C is a cyanide salt, and D is something like H2O, but that might not fit. Alternatively, if C is a metal cyanide, and D is an acid, perhaps?

Wait, but another thought: if D is O2, maybe C is a hydrocarbon that upon reaction with O2 forms CO (carbon monoxide) or CO2. But E is extremely hazardous, so maybe CO is the product, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, and D is something that would form a highly toxic gas. For example, if C is a nitride and D is H2O, but that forms NH3 and a base, which doesn't fit E being extremely hazardous.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial reaction is about the formation of something like a metal oxide. Let's imagine A is a metal, B is O2. So reaction 1: A (metal) + 8 O2 → C (metal oxide). But what metal would react with O2 in an 8:1 ratio?

Wait, maybe it's not O2. Let me think about another gas. What if B is Cl2?

So reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 Cl2 → C (bright red). What could C be? Maybe a metal chloride. For example, iron reacts with Cl2 in presence of a catalyst to form FeCl3. But the stoichiometry would be Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3, which is a 1:3 ratio, not 8:1. So perhaps another metal.

Wait, another possibility: Lead. Lead can form lead(II,IV) oxide, which is red. So reaction 1 could be PbO2 perhaps? Hmm, but how would that form from a reaction with Cl2?

Alternatively, perhaps A is lead metal, and B is Cl2. Then, the reaction could be Pb + Cl2 → PbCl2. But the stoichiometry would be 2 Pb + 3 Cl2 → 2 PbCl3? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is Pb + Cl2 → PbCl2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is not Cl2 but another diatomic gas like F2. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. If A is a metal, like copper, then Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2? But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but then when C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If C is a fluorinated compound, perhaps E is something like HF, but HF is a strong acid but not extremely hazardous in the same way as, say, sarin.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too deep into this without enough information. Let me try to think about E's structure and its symmetry.

The options for symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, I remember that D∞h is the symmetry group for linear molecules like CO2 (which is actually D∞h). No, wait, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, and if E is a gas, perhaps it's a linear molecule.

Wait, another option: if E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a gas. Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and has two Cl atoms. So the structure is O=C(Cl)2. That's a trigonal planar molecule. The symmetry group for phosgene is D∞h because it has a mirror plane perpendicular to the C=O bond and a C2 axis.

Wait, or wait. Phosgene is actually a planar molecule with a central carbon connected to an O and two Cl atoms. The symmetry group would be D∞h because it has a center of inversion, a C2 axis, and mirror planes.

Alternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is a linear molecule. HCN has the structure H-C≡N, which is linear. The symmetry group of HCN is D∞h because of the linear structure with a C∞ axis and mirror planes.

Wait, but another possibility: if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry. For example, molecules like H2O or SO2 have C2v symmetry. Wait, no, SO2 is trigonal planar with a C2v symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, maybe E is a molecule with C2 symmetry, such as a center of inversion. For example, something like a bent structure with a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecule.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. What's the symmetry group of E?

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is likely D∞h. For example, O2, CO2, HCN, etc., have D∞h symmetry.

If E is a planar molecule with a C2 axis and mirror planes, then it's D2h or similar.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a molecule with a C2v symmetry. For example, SO2 has a trigonal planar structure with a C2v symmetry group.

But wait, if E is a highly hazardous gas, perhaps it's a nerve agent like sarin, which has a structure similar to an organophosphate. But I don't know the exact symmetry of sarin.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure. ClF3 has a C3v symmetry, I think.

Wait, but the options don't include C3v. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, if E is a molecule like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry group. Because O3 has a central O with two others attached, the structure is bent, and the symmetry group is C2v.

If that's the case, then the answer would be C2v (option D).

But wait, Ozone's symmetry group is actually D∞h? Or is it C2v? I'm getting a bit confused.

No, wait. Ozone (O3) is a bent molecule with a central oxygen atom. Its point group is C2v because it has a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and two mirror planes. So yes, it's C2v.

Alternatively, phosgene (COCl2) has a structure where the central C is double-bonded to O and attached to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar, with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane and mirror planes, so its point group is D∞h.

So if E is a planar molecule like phosgene, the symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). If E is ozone, then C2v (option D).

But earlier, I thought E is a product of C reacting with D (gas). So, considering E is a gas, what's more likely? Ozone is a gas, phosgene is a gas.

But without knowing E's identity, it's hard to decide.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids.

If C is a sulfonate ester, maybe it's something like RSO3-O-R', which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and R'OH (weak acid if R' is something like CH3). So F could be H2SO4 and G could be CH3OH (which is a weak acid? Wait, no, CH3OH is a weak base. Hmm, maybe not).

Alternatively, if C is a nitrate and a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If C is a carbonate, but that doesn't produce two acids upon hydrolysis. So perhaps C is a sulfite. Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) when hydrolyzed gives H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH. Wait, that would give a base and an acid. So perhaps F is H2SO3 (weak acid), and G is NaOH (strong base, but not an acid). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (a weak base) and Ca(OH)2 (a base). So that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate ester. For example, if C is (RO)3P=O, then upon hydrolysis, it would form H3PO4 (a weak acid) and ROH (an alcohol, which is a weak acid? No, alcohols are weak bases in water.)

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

From reaction 4: D and B combine to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B could be H2 and O2. But that seems unlikely as H2 and O2 don't react to form H2O without a catalyst.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: what if B is NH3 and D is HCl? Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if B is NO and D is O2, then NO + O2 → N2O4 or NO2. Hmm, but H would be a solvent, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethanol. Ethanol can be formed from a reaction between CO and H2. So, if D is CO and B is H2, then CO + H2 → CH3CH2OH (ethanol), which is a solvent. So reaction 4 could be B (H2) + D (CO) → H (ethanol). That makes sense.

Then, in reaction 1: A is a solid, reacting with 8 equivalents of H2 (B) to form C (bright red). So A + 8 H2 → C.

What solid reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product?

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a complex with H2. Or maybe it's a metal that forms a hydride.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe3O4, reacting with H2 would form Fe and H2O. But that doesn't form a bright red product. Alternatively, perhaps A is PbO2, which is bright red. PbO2 is lead(IV) oxide, which is dark brown, but maybe another form. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that when reacts with H2 forms a compound that is bright red. For example, maybe CuO reacts with H2 to form Cu and H2O, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps A is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is bright yellow, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a metal hydride. For example, sodium reacts with H2 to form NaH. So Na + H2 → NaH. But the stoichiometry would be 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH, which is 2:1, not 8:1.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex with H2. For example, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a coordination compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that when reacts with H2 forms a compound that is bright red. I'm not sure about any such metal.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is a dark brown, but maybe another oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different kind of compound, like a sulfonic acid or something else. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about E's structure. If E is a linear molecule, then symmetry group is D∞h. If E is a bent molecule, it's C2v. If E is a trigonal planar, perhaps D3h, but that's not an option.

So, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Which of these symmetry groups is correct for E?

If E is a linear molecule, D∞h. If it's a trigonal planar, maybe D3h, but that's not an option. If it's a bent molecule, C2v.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a C2 axis. For example, something with C2 symmetry.

Wait, another approach: what is the most common symmetry group among the options?

D∞h is for linear molecules. C2v is for bent molecules. C2 is for molecules with a C2 axis, like water (H2O has C2v, not C2).

Wait, H2O's symmetry is C2v, not C2. So the only options are D∞h (linear) and C2v (bent).

So, if E is a linear molecule, the symmetry is D∞h, else if bent, C2v.

Which E is more likely to be linear or bent?

If E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), that's planar and linear, symmetry D∞h.

If E is HCN, linear, D∞h.

If E is Ozone, bent, C2v.

So, which is more likely?

Another thought: the problem says E is produced when C reacts with two equivalents of gas D.

If D is O2, and C is a sulfide, then C + 2 O2 → SO2 + ... Maybe E is SO2, which has a trigonal planar structure. But SO2 is trigonal planar with a C2v symmetry group.

Wait, but earlier I thought about ozone. So perhaps E is Ozone (O3), which is bent and has C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is something like phosgene, which is planar, D∞h.

But without knowing E's identity, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can get back to the reactions. Let me try to piece together the reactions again.

Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent). If H is ethanol, then B and D must be something that forms ethanol. For example, if B is CO and D is H2, then CO + H2 → CH3CH2OH (ethanol), which is a solvent. So in this case, B is H2, D is CO.

Wait, but then in reaction 1: A reacts with 8 H2 → C (bright red). So A + 8 H2 → C.

What solid reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? Maybe A is a metal that forms a complex with H2. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal and water. But that would mean C is water, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that when reacts with H2 forms a hydride. For example, sodium metal reacts with H2 to form NaH. The reaction is 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. The stoichiometry is 2:1, but in the problem, it's 8 equivalents, so 1:8 ratio. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a complex with H2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a metal hydride with H2. For example, perhaps A is Ca, and the reaction is Ca + 8 H2 → CaH2. But that's a 1:2 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a different compound. For example, maybe A is a metal that forms a carbide, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a different kind of compound, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: perhaps C is a compound that when reacts with H2O gives two different acids. So, if F is HCl (strong) and G is HNO2 (weak), then perhaps C is a nitro compound.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts that when hydrolyzed give two acids. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something like (RCO)2O, which upon hydrolysis gives two carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate hydroxide, but that again doesn't directly give two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is RSO3-O-R', upon hydrolysis, it would form RSO3H (a strong acid if R is something like tosyl) and R'OH (which could be a weak acid if R' is something like CH3, making it methanol, a weak acid? No, methanol is a weak base.)

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.

Back to E's structure. If E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So the symmetry group would be C2v (option D).

Alternatively, if E is phosgene, D∞h.

But how can I decide? I think I need to think about which option makes more sense based on the reactions.

Wait, in reaction 3: C reacts with H2O to form A plus two acids. So if C is a sulfonate ester, for example, upon hydrolysis, it would form a strong acid (like H2SO4) and another acid (like acetic acid). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, each giving an acid upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate. For example, perhaps C is something like NaNO3 and Na2SO4. But that's more than a single compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. 

Given the options, I think the most likely symmetry group for a highly hazardous gas like phosgene would be D∞h (option C). But another possibility is ozone with C2v (option D). But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B react with A to form C. If B is H2, and A is something that reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio, perhaps it's a metal that forms a complex with H2.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that when reacts with H2 forms a complex with a higher hydrogen content. For example, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a dihydride or trihydride. But I'm not familiar with such reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a carbide. For example, silicon carbide doesn't react with H2 under normal conditions.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a nitride. For example, lithium reacts with nitrogen to form Li3N. But the stoichiometry would be 3 Li : 1 N2 → 2 Li3N. So 3 Li + N2 → 2 Li3N, which is 3:2 ratio, not 8:1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex with H2 in a 1:8 ratio. But I can't think of any such metal.

Wait, perhaps A is something like sodium, and the reaction is 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. Stoichiometry is 2:1. So 8 equivalents would require Na to be 8 moles for each mole of H2. That would make C as NaH, but NaH is a solid, and C is bright red. NaH is white, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the initial reaction is about the formation of a metal oxide. For example, a metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. But earlier thoughts didn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a redox reaction. A is a metal, B is O2. The reaction forms a metal oxide C, which is bright red. So perhaps A is Fe, and C is Fe2O3, which is reddish. But the stoichiometry would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3, which is 4:3 ratio, not 8:1.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is lead metal, and B is O2. Pb + O2 → PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is bright yellow. But the reaction would be 4 Pb + 5 O2 → 2 Pb2O5, which is more yellowish, but maybe varying forms can be red. But the stoichiometry isn't matching 8:1.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like aluminum reacting with oxygen to form Al2O3. But that would be 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3, again not 8 equivalents.

Hmm. I'm really stuck on this first reaction. Maybe I should move forward and make an assumption to proceed.

Assume that E is a linear molecule, so symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

But wait, looking back, reaction 3 is C + H2O → A + F + G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, which upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid (like H2SO4) and a weak acid (like acetic acid). So if C is CH3SO3OCH3, upon hydrolysis, it would give H2SO4 and CH3COOH. That would fit.

Then, what is C? It's a sulfonate ester. How would it form from A and B?

If A is CH3CH3 (ethane?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester formed from a reaction between a sulfonic acid and an alcohol.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, if A is NaOH, and B is something else, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester derived from a diol. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I should go with the assumption that E is a linear molecule, leading to D∞h symmetry (option C). Alternatively, if E is Ozone, the symmetry is C2v (option D).

But without knowing E's structure, it's hard. Another angle: the options for E's symmetry group include D4h, which is the symmetry group of the square planar molecules. But I don't see how E would be square planar.

Alternatively, D4h symmetry could be for molecules like XeF4, which has a seesaw geometry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If E is a molecule like H2O2, its symmetry group is C2v because it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis and mirror planes.

But H2O2 isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if E is something like Cl2O7, which is a highly toxic gas. Cl2O7 is a planar molecule with a Cl-O-Cl structure, similar to O3. So its symmetry would be C2v.

If that's the case, the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I'll have to go with this.

The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (1:8) and the bright red color suggest that A and B could be a metal and a diatomic gas, respectively. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear despite various possibilities considered (e.g., metals reacting with O₂ or H₂).

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. This implies that E is likely a toxic gas or compound. Possible candidates for E include linear or bent molecules like phosgene (O=C(Cl)₂), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or ozone (O₃).

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C is a salt or ester that hydrolyzes to yield acids. For example, if C were a sulfonate ester, it could produce a strong acid like H₂SO₄ and a weak acid like CH₃COOH.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This implies that D and B could be gases that combine to form a common solvent like ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH). For example, if B is CO and D is H₂, they could form ethanol via the reaction CO + H₂ → CH₃CH₂OH.

5. **Symmetry Group Analysis**: The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure. If E is a linear molecule (e.g., phosgene or HCN), its symmetry group would be **D∞h**. If E is a bent molecule (e.g., ozone), its symmetry group would be **C2v**. Based on the reactions and the description of E as extremely hazardous, ozone (O₃) is a plausible candidate, as it is a bent molecule with **C2v** symmetry.

Given the reasoning above, the molecular symmetry group of E is most consistent with **C2v**, corresponding to a bent molecule like ozone.
