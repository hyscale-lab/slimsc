Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle being involved in the energy-time relation. Let me think.

The question says we have two energy states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D with different eV values.

Wait, so the lifetime here refers to the mean lifetime of the state before it decays, I think. Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty (ΔE) to the time uncertainty (Δt). The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Or wait, is it ħ divided by the uncertainty time? Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for order of magnitude purposes, we can say ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt.

So, to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them (ΔE) should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the difference, we can't tell them apart. So, the energy difference must be much larger than the uncertainty.

Let me compute the uncertainty for each state. The first state has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Wait, but which one is more relevant? Oh, because we're trying to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe each of them individually. Hmm. I think each state has its own uncertainty, but the energy difference needs to be bigger than the smallest uncertainty to be distinguishable. Wait, no. Let's think again.

The reasoning is that the energy levels are not infinitely sharp. They have a certain width determined by their lifetimes. So, if the energy difference is about the same as the width of the lines, it's hard to tell them apart. But if the difference is much larger than the widths, you can clearly see two separate peaks.

So for each state, the width is about ħ/(τ). So the first state's width is ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9 s) and the second is ΔE2= ħ/(1e-8 s).

Wait, but which one is bigger? Since τ2 is larger, ΔE2 is smaller. So the first state has a larger energy uncertainty (since 1e-9 is smaller than 1e-8, so dividing by a smaller number gives a larger value).

Wait, to calculate these, perhaps I should plug in the numbers. Let me remember ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1=6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

Hmm, that's about 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. So 6.5e-7 is around 0.000000658 eV.

The second state, τ2=1e-8 s. So ΔE2=6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV, which is 0.00000006582 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states. Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be significantly larger than both of these, or at least larger than the larger uncertainty, right? Wait, because the larger the uncertainty, the harder it is to distinguish. So the energy difference must be bigger than the sum maybe? Or perhaps the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, maybe the minimal difference needed is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is just a bit more than the sum, you can clearly see two peaks. Alternatively, perhaps it's the larger individual uncertainty because if the uncertainty is bigger, the lines are broader, so the difference needs to be more than the broader one.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state. Wait, let me think. Because each state has a certain line width, which is determined by their lifetimes. If the two lines are close, their peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So, for the lines to be clearly resolved, the separation between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2), perhaps following the same logic as in spectroscopy where the resolving power requires the separation to be larger than the line widths.

Wait, in spectroscopy, the resolving power R is often given by R = λ/Δλ, and the condition for resolving two lines is that their separation λ1-λ2 is at least (Δλ1 + Δλ2). So applying that idea here, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two energy uncertainties.

Hmm. Let's compute the sum: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7.24e-7 eV to be clearly distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000001 eV? No, way smaller than 7e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4, which is 1e-4 is 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 100 times bigger than 7.24e-7. So 0.0001 is larger than 7.24e-7, so this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7. So no.

So the only option that's larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 100,000 times larger than 7e-7. That seems a big difference, but perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps only the larger uncertainty matters because the uncertainty with the larger width is the dominant factor. So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, the two states can be resolved.

In that case, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be larger than that.

So the options are, which is larger than 6.58e-7 eV?

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.000000001, which is 1e-9, smaller than 6.58e-7.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001, which is larger than 6.58e-7? Let me see: 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658. 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 100 times larger. So yes, it's larger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.58e-7.

So C is the only option that's larger than the larger uncertainty. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, the question says "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So the minimum required is larger than the uncertainty. So any value larger than that would work. So for option C, it's much larger. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Let's see: ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be >7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV. 7.238e-7 is 0.0000007238 eV. So 0.0001 is larger than 0.0000007238. So yes, it's larger than the sum.

So the correct answer is option C.

To distinguish two quantum energy levels with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be sufficiently large to ensure the levels are resolvable. The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \Delta t \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

For the first state:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is also smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be clearly resolvable is **C**.
