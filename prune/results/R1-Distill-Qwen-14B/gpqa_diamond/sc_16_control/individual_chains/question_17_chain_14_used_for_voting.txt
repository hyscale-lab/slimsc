Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Wait, what's the K here about? I remember that the stability constant, Kf (formation constant), is used for complex ion formation. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2–, and Kf is the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

Given that, the complex concentration is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (stoichiometric), the initial concentrations before dissociation would be [CaEDTA^2–] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4–] are initially zero. But wait, in reality, the complex will dissociate a little, so there will be some free Ca²+ and EDTA^4– ions in solution.

But wait, is the solution assuming that the complex is fully dissociated? No, because K is large, meaning the complex is very stable, so little dissociation occurs. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Let me think about the expression for Kf. The formula is Kf = [CaEDTA^2–] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4–]). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2–, and assuming x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4–] = x as well (since each mole of complex releases one mole of each ion). Wait, but EDTA usually has multiple protons depending on pH, right? But the problem says pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all EDTA is in the form EDTA^4–.

So, substituting into the equation:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. The formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, and dissociates into x of each, then [CaEDTA^2–] would be 0.02 – x. But since Kf is so large, x should be very small compared to 0.02, so I can approximate [CaEDTA^2–] ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf ≈ 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, wait, that would give x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12.

So x = sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C: 6.3e-7, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than what I just got. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me redo the math.

Kf = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → which is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.3e-7 M. Oh wait, because sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 2e-6.5 is 2/(1e6.5). 1e6 is 1,000,000, 1e6.5 is about 3.16e6. So 2/3.16e6 ≈ 6.3e-7. Oh, right, so x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.

Wait, but why did I get 4.4e-6 earlier? Oh, because I must have made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again.

Ah, I see where I went wrong. Let's go step by step.

Kf = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. But 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

Ah, so x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That matches option C. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, what about activity coefficients and other factors? The problem says to assume ideal conditions, so activity coefficients are 1, so we don't need to worry about that.

Another thing to consider: the concentration of EDTA. Since EDTA is present in solution as a result of dissociation, but in the problem, it's a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial EDTA concentration is zero, but it comes from the dissociation. So the approach is correct.

So the [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we assume that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) ions. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
