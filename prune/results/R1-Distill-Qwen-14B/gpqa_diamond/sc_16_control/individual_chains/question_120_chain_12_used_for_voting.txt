Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A) 1/plx^4, B) 1/plx^2, C) 1/plx^1, D) 1/plx^3.

Hmm. So, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, right? And a higher parallax means a closer star.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So if I have a range of parallax values, how does the count change with plx? Oh, right, it's about the density in the parallax space.

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density would be the same in any volume. But when we project that onto the sky, things change. Parallax is a projection of distance onto the sky. So the number of stars we observe with a certain parallax depends on how much volume is available at that distance.

Let me think about this. The number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d would be proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the thickness in distance. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and the thickness is dd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² dd. But wait, since the distribution is uniform, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars N in a shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d (in arcseconds if d is parsecs). So d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the equation. N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd is the change in d. How does dd relate to a change in parallax, dplx? Because plx = 1/d. So if d changes by dd, plx changes by dplx. Let me compute that derivative.

plx = 1/d → dplx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dplx. Since d is positive, the negative sign indicates that as d increases, plx decreases. But when considering an infinitesimal change, the exact direction might not matter for the proportionality.

So, substituting dd into N: N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/(plx)^2 ) dplx ). Wait, let me compute d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting back into N: N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Simplify this:

N = n * 4π * (1/(plx^2)) * ( -1/(plx²) dplx )

Wait, so the number of stars in a parallax range dplx is N = n *4π * (1/plx^4) * (-dplx). But since dplx is positive (we're considering intervals), maybe we can ignore the negative sign here because we're considering a small positive change in plx.

So N is proportional to (1 / plx^4) * dplx. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which would be dN/dplx. Wait, no, because the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So that's the number in a thin range dplx, divided by dplx. So that's dN/dplx.

Wait, N is the number of stars in a thin range dplx. So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx. But from the equation, dN = n *4π (1/plx^4) * dplx. So dN/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number decreases as plx increases.

Wait, but that would correspond to option A. But wait, the options are about how the number changes (the dependence on plx). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach: the volume element in 3D space is dV = 4π d² dd. Because if you think of a thin shell, the volume is surface area (4πd²) times thickness dd. Then, the number of stars is n * dV = n 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Substitute into dV:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is n * dV = n * (-4π) (1/plx^4) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering positive ranges, the magnitude is what matters. So the number of stars per unit plx is (n *4π) (1/plx^4). Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but this would mean that as plx increases (meaning closer stars), the number per unit plx would be higher. So higher concentration of stars in lower plx (since plx is inverse of distance). But wait, the question says how the number changes with plx. So the dependence is 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Hmm, but I remember something else. When considering the distribution of stars along the line of sight, the number of stars with a parallax between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^3. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius d is N = n * 4π d² dd. But parallax plx is 1/d. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So substituting into N, N = n 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. Now, how does dd relate to dplx? Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting back: N = n 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/plx^2 dplx ) → N = -n 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but for our purposes, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach comes to mind. Let's think in terms of distances.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. The number of stars within a distance d and d + dd is n * (4/3) π (d+dd)^3 - (4/3) π d^3 ≈ n * 4 π d² dd.

So the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d is proportional to d² dd.

Now, parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So substituting, the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But we want the number per unit of plx. So how does dd translate in terms of plx?

Since d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the number of stars: N = k * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) dplx) → N = k * (-1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but dplx is positive, so the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is what we're considering. So the number of stars in a dplx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So it's (number of stars) per (plx unit). So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = N / dplx → which would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer would be A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I remember that the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. But when projecting into parallax, the distribution changes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of flux. But no, that's not relevant here. Let's think about differential number of stars.

dN = n * 4π d² dd. But d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So dN = n 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) dplx → dN = -4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a plx interval dplx is dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) (-dplx), but since dplx is positive, the magnitude is 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Which again gives the same result.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin shell of stars at a distance \( d \), the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \), multiplied by the thickness \( dd \). Thus, \( N \propto 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, \( d \) decreases, but the magnitude is what matters. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases, following the dependence \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
