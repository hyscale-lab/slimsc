Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options given are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (or the time over which the energy is measured) of a state. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the time should be on the order of ħ.

Hmm, but wait, in this case, the question is about the energy difference needed so that the two states can be distinguished. So maybe I need to calculate the minimum energy difference that can be resolved given their lifetimes. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell them apart.

So each state has its own lifetime. Or wait, are we considering the energy difference between E2 and E1? Because the question is about distinguishing E1 and E2, which are two separate states. So the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1.

I think the key is that the energy resolution should be better than the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy, ΔE, for each state is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). So for each state, this would be their own uncertainty.

Wait, but the problem is about distinguishing the two states. So perhaps the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty would be the smaller of the two uncertainties because if one has a longer lifetime, its uncertainty is smaller.

Let me think. For state 1, lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, for state 2, τ2=1e-8 s, so ΔE2≈ ħ/(2τ2). Since τ2 is larger, ΔE2 is smaller because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ.

So the uncertainty is larger for the shorter-lived state. To distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference should be larger than the largest uncertainty, perhaps. Because if the energy difference is less than the uncertainty, the two states might not be resolved.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the energy difference should be larger than the minimum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps the energy difference must exceed the sum of the uncertainties. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each state's uncertainty needs to be such that their energy intervals don't overlap. So the minimum energy difference between E1 and E2 should be at least the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the sum, they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, no. Because each state's uncertainty is about its own energy. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the distance between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is larger than the combined uncertainties, the two states won't be confused. So the condition is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute the uncertainties first. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for state 1: τ1=1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J.

Hmm, but we usually work in eV when dealing with atomic scales. Let me convert that to eV.

1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 ≈ 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2: τ2=1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.0545e-34) / (2e-8) = approx 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum of these would be approximately 3.62e-7 eV. So if the energy difference ΔE is greater than 3.62e-7 eV, then they can be distinguished.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.

Wait, none of the options are near 3.6e-7 eV. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Let me recalculate using more precise numbers. Let me compute each step.

Compute ΔE1:

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 τ1) = 1.05457e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.27285e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-26 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (5.27285 / 1.60218) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.29 * 1e-7 eV = 3.29e-7 eV.

So same as before.

For ΔE2:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = 1.05457e-34 / (2e-8) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27285e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-27 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ (5.27285 / 1.60218) * 1e-8 eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than this sum. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. Hmm, that's way larger than our calculated 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Because each state has its own uncertainty in energy. So to clearly resolve E2 from E1, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of their respective uncertainties.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the measurement, which would depend on the setup. Wait, perhaps the lifetime is the time over which the state is measured, so the energy uncertainty in the system would be ħ/(2τ), where τ is the lifetime.

In this case, perhaps the measurement's uncertainty is based on the longer of the two lifetimes, or the shorter, but that's unclear.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the energy resolution. The energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in the energy of each state. The energy difference between the two must be greater than the uncertainty for each. So if the energy difference is bigger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, perhaps?

Wait, let me think again. The two states have their own energy uncertainties. The uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 3.29e-8 eV. So, the uncertainty for E1 is larger than E2.

So, to distinguish E1 and E2, the difference in their energies must be greater than ΔE1, because if the difference is smaller than ΔE1, the uncertainty from E1 alone may blur the distinction.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about it in another way. The energy difference, ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, the measurement of ΔE must be precise enough. The uncertainty in ΔE would be approximately the maximum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. Because if E1 has a larger uncertainty, then the overall uncertainty in the difference would be dominated by E1's uncertainty.

Wait, no. Actually, when you take the difference of two variables, the uncertainty in the difference is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties. So, Δ(ΔE) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ).

Since ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, their squares would be (3.29e-7)^2 ≈ 1e-13, and (3.29e-8)^2 ≈ 1e-15. So the sum is about 1.01e-13. The square root is about 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 eV.

Wait, that's roughly the same as the larger uncertainty.

So, the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE is approximately sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) ≈ 3.6e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference to be clearly distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than this uncertainty. So ΔE > 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's way larger, so that would be clearly distinguishable.

Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 1e-9 eV. That's much less than 3.6e-7 eV. So that would not be enough.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Still 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, so 0.01 times 3.6e-7 is 3.6e-9. So 1e-8 is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8 eV versus 3.6e-7 eV. 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7, so no, that wouldn't be enough.

Wait, none of the options except C are larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So the correct answer would be C) 1e-4 eV.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck. Because the calculation I did gave the uncertainty in ΔE as approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that can be resolved.

Looking at the options, the only option larger than 3.6e-7 is option C (1e-4 eV) and option D is 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is way larger.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the combined uncertainty in the energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately the root sum of squares of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):
\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{(3.29 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (3.29 \times 10^{-8})^2} \approx \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-13} + 1.08 \times 10^{-15}} \approx 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is significantly larger than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can be resolved.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
