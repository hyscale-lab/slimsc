Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'll need to think through this carefully. I remember that in classical mechanics, the harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are probably different.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So the force is linear with displacement, like a spring. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. ω is sqrt(k/m), right? So v_max would be sqrt(k/m) * A. But wait, that's non-relativistic. Relativistic speeds would require using the relativistic equations of motion.

Alternatively, maybe energy considerations are the way to go. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so we can't just use that.

Relativistic mechanics usually involves the Lorentz factor gamma. So maybe in the relativistic case, the energy is higher because of the gamma factor. The total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, maybe the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is treated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps we should write down the relativistic equation of motion. The force is F = -kx, so using F = dp/dt, where p is relativistic momentum. Relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the equation would be dp/dt = -kx. Let's write that out:

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But x is a function of time, so this becomes a differential equation. It might be tricky to solve, but perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, maybe using energy conservation. In the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy is conserved. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. At equilibrium (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but what's the potential energy in the relativistic case? In classical mechanics, it's (1/2)k x². But for relativistic cases, maybe it's the same? Or does it change? Hmm, the question says it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So the potential energy U is the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x², same as before. So U = (1/2)k x².

So the total energy E is U evaluated at x=A, which is (1/2)k A². But in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy plus the rest energy equals E. Wait, no, in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass. So E_total = gamma m c².

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The energy of a particle is E = gamma m c². At maximum displacement, the particle is momentarily at rest (velocity zero), so kinetic energy is zero. So E = gamma m c² = m c² (since velocity is zero, gamma is 1). So E = m c².

But wait, that can't be right because when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy is (1/2)k A² = m c²? That can't be, because when you release the oscillator, it starts moving and the energy should be higher than just rest mass energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case is (1/2)k A², just like in the non-relativistic case. But when the particle is at x=0, it's moving, so its energy is E = gamma m c². So at x=0, E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, that makes sense. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, (1/2)k A². At equilibrium, all energy is kinetic, so E = gamma m c², which equals (1/2)k A². So gamma m c² = (1/2)k A². Solve for gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = (1/2)k A² / (m c²).

Wait, no. Let me write the equation:

gamma m c² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but that's only true if (1/2)k A² >= m c², which might not be the case. But the problem is asking for the maximum speed, so perhaps we can write gamma in terms of the given variables.

So gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but that would require gamma to be greater than or equal to 1, which it is because gamma is always >=1. So from gamma, we can find v.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as G for simplicity.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = G.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/G.

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(G²).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(G²).

v² = c² (1 - 1/(G²)).

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(G²)).

Substituting G:

G = (k A²)/(2 m c²), so G² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

1/(G²) = (4 m² c^4)/(k² A^4).

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me plug back into the equation for v:

v = c sqrt(1 - [4 m² c^4/(k^2 A^4)] )

Hmm, but none of the answer options look like that. Let me check the answer options.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))^2 )).

Wait, let's compute 1 - (kA²/(2m))^2. Hmm, but my expression has (kA²/(2m c²))^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the potential energy. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy at x=0 is (1/2) m v_max². But in the relativistic case, the total energy is E = gamma m c², which when x=0 would be E = (kinetic energy) + rest energy. Hmm, maybe I should think of E_total as the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, so when the oscillator is at x = A, velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A². At x=0, the energy is E = (gamma -1) m c² + m c² = gamma m c².

So, (1/2)k A² = gamma m c².

So gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings me back to the same equation. So from gamma, I can get v.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me compute 1 - v^2/c^2.

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma^2) = [ (2 m c²)/(k A^2) ]^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 ) / (k^2 A^4) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to write this as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ (2 m c^2)/(k A^2) ]^2 * (1/(4 m^2 c^4)) ) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me rearrange:

v²/c² = 1 - [ (2 m c²) / (k A²) ]^ (-2) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to manipulate the expression for gamma.

Gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Which is:

v = c * sqrt(1 - [ (2 m c²)/(k A^2) ]² )

Hmm, but that's not matching the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²)) )).

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the sqrt for option B:

1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²)) )

Let me denote K = kA²/(2 m c²).

So,

1 + 1/(1 - K).

Which is [ (1 - K) + 1 ] / (1 - K) ) = (2 - K) / (1 - K).

So the sqrt would be sqrt( (2 - K)/(1 - K) ) ) times c.

But I'm not sure if that's the same as our expression for v.

Wait, our v is c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) ), which is c * sqrt(1 - [ (2 m c²)/(k A²) ]² ).

Hmm, perhaps if I can express this in terms of K.

K = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/gamma^2 = 1/(K^2).

So, 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - 1/K².

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/K^2 )

But K is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so K = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/K^2:

1 - (2 m c²/(k A²))².

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me look again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Wait, let's compute 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Denote L = k A²/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + L)^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( ( (1 + L)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + L)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1 + 2 L + L^2 - 1 ) / (1 + L)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 L + L^2 ) / (1 + L)^2 )

= c * sqrt( L (2 + L) ) / (1 + L )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1/(1 + L)^2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should think about the equation of motion.

The equation is d(p)/dt = -k x, where p = gamma m v.

But in SHM, the equation is of the form d^2 x/dt^2 = - (k/m) x. But under relativity, the equation changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the equation in terms of momentum. Let me think.

The equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator could be dp/dt = -k x.

But p = gamma m v, and v = dx/dt.

So,

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But this is a second-order differential equation because gamma depends on v, which is dx/dt.

This might be complicated to solve. Maybe instead, use energy considerations as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the equation in terms of x.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the relation between velocity and position.

In the non-relativistic case, the energy equation is:

(1/2) m v² + (1/2)k x² = (1/2)k A².

So,

v_max occurs when x=0: (1/2) m v_max² = (1/2)k A² => v_max = sqrt( k A²/m ).

In the relativistic case, the energy is E = gamma m c².

At x= A, velocity is zero, so E = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (2 m c²)/(k A²).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4)/(k^2 A^4).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - (4 m² c^4)/(k^2 A^4).

But this seems complicated. Let me see if any of the options match this expression.

Looking at option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²)) )).

Inside the sqrt, it's 1 + [ 1/(1 - K) ], where K = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1 + 1/(1-K) = (1 - K + 1)/ (1 - K ) = (2 - K)/(1 - K).

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - K)/(1 - K) )

= c * sqrt( [2 - (k A²/(2 m c²)) ] / [1 - (k A²/(2 m c²))] )

Hmm, not quite matching what I have.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

So,

1 - [ 1/(1 + K)^2 ] where K is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v = c * sqrt( ( (1 + K)^2 - 1 )/(1 + K)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1 + 2 K + K² -1 )/(1 + K)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 K + K² ) / (1 + K)^2 )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K) ) / (1 + K )

= c * sqrt( (K (2 + K)) ) / (1 + K )

Hmm, not matching.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the sqrt.

1 + [1/(1 - (k A²/(2m))² ) ]

= [ (1 - (k A²/(2m))² ) + 1 ] / [1 - (k A²/(2m))² ]

= [ 2 - (k A²/(2m))² ] / [1 - (k A²/(2m))² ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( [2 - (k A²/(2m))² ] / [1 - (k A²/(2m))² ] )

Hmm, not matching my expression.

Wait, but in my expression, I have:

v_max² = c² (1 - (4 m² c^4)/(k^2 A^4) )

Which can be written as:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - (4 m² c^4)/(k^2 A^4) )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let's think of it as:

v = c * sqrt( (k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4) )

= c * ( sqrt( k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4 ) ) / (k A^2 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's write the equation again.

We have gamma = k A²/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1 - v²/c² = (2 m c²)/(k A²).

So,

v² = c² (1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²)).

Wait no: 1 - v²/c² = (2 m c²)/(k A²) → v²/c² = 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 2 m c²/(k A²) ] )

Wait, that's a much simpler expression. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A^2) )

But let's look at the options again.

Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Let me compute 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

Let me write K = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/(1 + K)^2 = 1/(1 + K)^2.

So,

1 - [1/(1 + K)^2] = [ (1 + K)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + K)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 K + K^2 - 1 ) = 2 K + K^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 K + K^2)/ (1 + K)^2 )

= c * sqrt( K(2 + K) ) / (1 + K )

Hmm, but my expression is v = c sqrt( 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²) ) which is v = c sqrt( 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²) ).

Wait, that's v²/c² = 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²).

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A² ) ]

= c² [ (k A² - 2 m c² ) / (k A^2) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps not matching.

Wait, let me express my expression for v as:

v = c * sqrt( [ k² A^4 - 2 m c² k A^2 ] / (k² A^4) )

= c * [ sqrt( k² A^4 - 2 m c² k A² ) ] / (k A^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the total energy is not just the potential energy. Oh, wait, in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is just the potential energy. But in relativistic terms, the potential energy might still be (1/2)k A², but the total energy is gamma m c².

Wait, so (1/2)k A^2 = gamma m c^2.

So,

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which gives,

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - (1/gamma^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2)/(k A^2) )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2)/(k A^2) )

Hmm, which is:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2) - 2 m c^2 ] / (k A^2) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) ) / (k A )

= sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) ) c / (k A )

But looking at the options, perhaps I can manipulate this expression to match one of the options.

Wait, let's look at option D again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) ))^2 )

Let me compute 1/(1 + K)^2, where K = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(1 + K)^2 = 1/(1 + K)^2.

So,

1 - [1/(1 + K)^2 ] = [ (1 + K )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + K )^2.

Numerator: (1 + 2 K + K^2 ) - 1 = 2 K + K^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 K + K^2)/(1 + K)^2 )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

Wait, let me substitute K = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

K = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

2 + K = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) = sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ] )

= sqrt( [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) )

= [ sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

= [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not seeing a clear path here. Maybe this approach isn't getting me anywhere.

Alternative plan: perhaps compute each option and see which one matches the expression I have.

My expression is:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (2 m c^2)/(k A^2) )

Let me manipulate this:

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 ) )

= sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) c² ) / (k A )

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me see option B:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Inside the sqrt: 1 + 1/(1 - K ), where K = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + [1/(1 - K ) ] = (1 - K + 1 )/(1 - K ) ) = (2 - K )/(1 - K )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - K )/(1 - K ) )

= c* sqrt( [2 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] )

Hmm, but my expression is [1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) ].

Wait, perhaps I can write 1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) as [ (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 ) ].

Which is the same as [ (2 m c² ( (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) ) - 1 ) ]/( (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) )² )?

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can manipulate my expression to look like option B.

Let me write 1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) = [ (k A^2 ) - 2 m c^2 ] / (k A^2 )

= [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) * 2 m c^2 - 2 m c^2 ] / (k A^2 )

= [ 2 m c^2 ( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) - 1 ) ] / (k A^2 )

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 2 m c^2 as (k A^2 )/(gamma ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an expression matching.

Wait, another approach: let me compute each option's expression and see which one matches the equation I derived.

My equation: v = c * sqrt(1 - (2 m c²)/(k A^2) )

Let me compute each option's v_max and see if any are equal.

Let me take option D:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Compute the term inside the sqrt:

1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 ]

Denote K = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

= 1 - [1/(1+K)^2 ]

= [ (1 + K )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + K )^2

= (1 + 2 K + K^2 - 1 ) / (1 + K )^2

= (2 K + K^2 ) / (1 + K )^2

= K (2 + K ) / (1 + K )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) / (1 + K )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ K (2 + K ) ] ) / (1 + K )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

Hmm, not the same as my expression. So option D doesn't seem to match.

Option A: v = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m ))^2 ) )

Wait, inside the sqrt, 1 + [1/(1 - K²) ] where K = (k A²)/(2 m )

= [ (1 - K² ) + 1 ] / (1 - K² )

= (2 - K² ) / (1 - K² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - K² )/(1 - K² ) )

Which doesn't seem to match.

Option B: v = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²) )) )

So,

Inside sqrt: 1 + 1/(1 - K ), K = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

= ( (1 - K ) + 1 )/(1 - K )

= (2 - K )/(1 - K )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - K )/(1 - K ) )

Again, not matching.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which we know is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options match, but that can't be right because one of them must be the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about the energy.

In the relativistic scenario, the potential energy is (1/2)k A² at x = A. At x=0, all energy is kinetic plus rest mass energy. So,

E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Wait, is that correct? Because when x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, no. The total energy is E = gamma m c². At x=A, velocity is zero, so E is (1/2)k A^2. But in reality, the potential energy in relativity might not be the same. Wait, the question says it obeys Hooke's law, which implies F = -k x. So the potential energy is (1/2)k x², same as non-relativistic. So when x=A, potential energy is (1/2)k A², and kinetic energy is zero. Thus, E = (1/2)k A².

But in the relativistic case, the total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So,

E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which brings me back to the same equation.

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1 - v²/c² = (2 m c² )/(k A² )

So,

v^2 = c² (1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²) )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A²) )

Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

Option D's expression, after simplification, is v = c * sqrt( [K (2 + K ) ] ) / (1 + K ), where K = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Well, substituting K into the expression:

[ K (2 + K ) ] = [ (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ) ]

= [ (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) * ( (4 m c^2 + k A² )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [4 m² c^4 ]

So,

sqrt( [ K (2 + K ) ] ) = sqrt( [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 )

= A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not directly matching.

Wait, perhaps if I express my expression in terms of K.

My expression is:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2)/(k A^2) )

= c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2)/(k A^2) )

Expressed in terms of K:

K = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

(2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) = 1/K.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/K )

= c * sqrt( (K - 1)/K )

= c * sqrt( (K - 1) ) / sqrt(K )

= c * sqrt( (K - 1) ) / sqrt(K )

Wait, but option D has v_max as c * sqrt( [ K (2 + K ) ] ) / (1 + K )

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again: the total energy in the relativistic case is E = gamma m c^2. At x=A, E = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - v²/c² = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 (1 - [2 m c²/(k A^2)] )

Hmm, perhaps this is the simplest form it can get, and none of the options match. But that can't be right. So perhaps I need to re-express this expression.

Wait, let me rearrange the terms:

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 ) ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) ) / (k A )

Hmm, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I can factor something else. Let me think about the denominator.

k A^2 = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * 2 m c^2.

Which is K * 2 m c^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/K ), where K = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as:

v = c * sqrt( (K - 1)/K )

Because,

1 - 1/K = (K - 1)/K.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (K -1)/K )

Which can be written as,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/K )

But none of the options directly match this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D has:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + K )^2 ), where K is (k A²/(2 m c²) )

So, 1/(1 + K )^2 is 1/(1 + K )^2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (K - 1)/K as [ (K + 1) - 2 ]/(K + 1) ) * (1/(1 + something )).

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is none of the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the equation of motion is different. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation is not F = -k x, but perhaps a different form. But the question states it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -k x. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the proper relativistic energy expression. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So when the oscillator is at x = A, all energy is potential. At x=0, all energy is kinetic plus rest energy.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So,

E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = (1/2)k A² / (m c² )

So,

gamma = (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Which is correct.

So, again, v = c sqrt(1 - (2 m c² )/(k A^2 ) )

Hmm, but perhaps looking at the answer options, option B has a term (k A²/(2 m c² )) in the denominator.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) )

Hmm, let me compute the expression inside sqrt.

1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

= [ (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) + 1 ] / [ 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ]

= [ 2 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ 2 - K ] / [1 - K ] ), where K = k A²/(2 m c^2 )

Which is, when K is small, approximately c * sqrt( 2 / 1 ) = sqrt(2) c, but that's not matching our earlier expression.

Wait, but my expression is v = c sqrt(1 - [ (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) ] ) = c sqrt( 1 - 2 m c^2 / (k A^2 ) )

Which can be written as c sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly match, but I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the virial theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's write the equation of motion using relativistic momentum.

d(p)/dt = -k x.

Where p = gamma m v, and v = dx/dt.

So,

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

Hmm, but this is a complicated DE because gamma depends on v, which depends on x and t.

Alternatively, perhaps using the invariant quantity in special relativity, the four-momentum. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy expression.

Wait, perhaps the maximum speed is when the entire potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in relativistic terms, that's E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 (1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps none of the options match, but option D's expression:

v = c* sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + K )^2 ), where K = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

But from my earlier calculation, this becomes:

v = c * sqrt( (2 K + K^2 )/(1 + K )^2 )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

Hmm, I don't see any option matching this either.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the expression in terms of (1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 m c^2)/(k A^2 )

So,

(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

Which can be rearranged as,

(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 2 m c^2 / (k A^2 )

= (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, perhaps option D is the correct one.

Wait, but when I compute option D's expression, I get v = c * sqrt( (2 K + K^2 )/(1 + K )^2 ), which doesn't match my expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option B, because when K is small, the expression would match approximately.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in some limit, say when K is small, which option would reduce to the non-relativistic case.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) → 0, since c is very large. So let's see how each option behaves when K approaches 0.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - K^2 ) )

When K is small, 1/(1 - K^2 ) ≈ 1 + K^2.

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 2 + K^2 ) ≈ c * sqrt(2 ) when K→0.

But the non-relativistic case is v = sqrt( k A²/m ) = sqrt( (k A^2) / m ) → which, when compared to option A's non-relativistic limit, would require:

sqrt( (k A^2)/(m ) ) = c sqrt(2 )

So,

k A²/(m ) = 2 c² → which is not generally true. So option A is not correct.

Option B: v = c sqrt( (2 - K )/(1 - K ) )

When K →0,

≈ c sqrt( 2/(1) ) = c sqrt(2 ), again not matching the non-rel limit.

Option C: v = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is correct for non-relativistic, but the question is relativistic, so C is not correct.

Option D: v = c * sqrt( (2 K + K^2 )/(1 + K )^2 )

When K →0,

≈ c * sqrt( 2 K ) → which tends to zero, which isn't correct because in non-rel limit, v should be sqrt(k A²/m ) = sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m ) ), which is larger than zero.

Hmm, so perhaps none of the options are correct, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Another approach: perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is not (1/2)k A^2, but something else.

Wait, the question says the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the potential energy is U = (1/2)k x^2, same as non-relativistic.

But when you have relativistic speeds, the mass increases, so the energy expressions change.

Wait, but earlier approach should be correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the equation of motion includes relativistic terms, such as acceleration being a function of velocity.

The equation is d(p)/dt = -k x.

p = gamma m v.

So,

d/dt (gamma m v ) = -k x.

But x is a function of time, and v = dx/dt.

This is a complicated equation because gamma depends on v, which depends on x and t. Not easy to solve.

But perhaps for maximum speed, we can find when the acceleration is zero. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the virial theorem. The virial theorem states that the average kinetic energy is (1/2) m <v²>, and the average potential energy is (1/2)k <x²>. But in SHM, <x²> = A²/2.

Hmm, but in the relativistic case, the virial theorem might not hold.

Wait, but if I use the virial theorem, then at maximum speed, all energy is kinetic. So,

(1/2) m v_max^2 = (1/2)k A^2 → same as non-relativistic. Which can't be correct because in relativity, v_max is lower than non-rel because of the gamma factor.

Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for the period of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the oscillator, perhaps, but no, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps dimensional analysis. Let me look at the options.

The options must have units of velocity.

Option A: c * sqrt( ... )

Inside the sqrt, it's 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m ))^2 )

The term (k A^2/(2m )) is dimensionless (since k has units of force per length, so [k] = ML^{-1}T^{-2}. A is L, so (k A^2 ) has units ML^{-1}T^{-2} * L^2 = ML T^{-2}.

Divided by m (ML^3 T^{-2} ), so (k A^2/(2m )) has units (ML T^{-2}) / (ML^3 T^{-2}) ) = L^{-2}. Not dimensionless. So this can't be correct. So option A is invalid.

Wait, that can't be right because the denominator must have the same units as the numerator.

Wait, wait: k A^2 has [k] = N/m = MLT^{-2} * L^{-1} T^{0} } → [k] = MLT^{-2} * L^{-1} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}.

Wait, no: Force F = k x → [k] = F/x → [k] = (MLT^{-2})/(L) )= ML^{-1} T^{-2}.

So, (k A^2)/(2m ) → [k] * L^2 / (M ) → (M L^{-1} T^{-2}) * L^2 ) / M ) → T^{-2}.

So, (k A^2/(2m )) has units of 1/T². So, (k A^2/(2m ))^2 → 1/T^4. So 1 - (k A^2/(2m ))^2 is not dimensionless. So option A is invalid because the argument inside the sqrt must be dimensionless.

Same for option B: (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) → [k A^2] = ML^{-1} T^{-2} * L^2 → ML T^{-2}. Divided by (m c^2 ) → (ML T^{-2})/(ML^2 T^{-2}) ) → L^{-1}.

So, (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) is dimensionless. So inside the sqrt in option B, 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ), which is dimensionless. So option B is acceptable.

Option C: sqrt( k A^2/m ). Units: [k A^2] = MLT^{-2} * L^2 → ML^3 T^{-2}.

Divided by [m] which is ML^3 T^{-2} → dimensionless. So option C is correct in terms of units.

Option D: (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) → same as option B, dimensionless.

So, options B and D have correct units, and option C is the non-relativistic case, which is correct in units.

So, between B and D.

But let me think: if the maximum speed can't exceed c, which option B and D are of the form c multiplied by something, which would be acceptable.

Wait, when K is small (non-relativistic limit), option B's expression becomes:

v ≈ c * sqrt( (2 - K ) / (1 - K ) ) → c * sqrt( (2 - 0)/(1 - 0) ) ) = c * sqrt(2 )

But non-rel limit should be v_max = sqrt( k A²/m ), which in terms of c would be much less than c.

Hmm, so option B's non-rel limit gives v_max = c sqrt(2 ), which is higher than the non-rel case, which can't be right.

Option D, when K is small:

v ≈ c * sqrt( (2 K + K^2 ) ) / (1 + K )^2 )

Wait, no, earlier calculation for D's v in small K is:

v ≈ c * sqrt( 2 K ) → sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) ) * c.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2) ) )

= c * ( A sqrt( k/m ) ) / c )

= A sqrt( k/m )

Which is the non-relativistic v_max.

So, option D's non-rel limit is correct.

So, the correct answer must be option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when K is small, option D reduces to the non-rel limit. So that suggests option D is correct.

Wait, but earlier analysis didn't seem to directly match, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

So, option D:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

In non-relativistic case, k A²/(2 m c^2 ) is small, so 1 + K ≈ 1.

So,

1/(1 + K )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 K.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + K )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 K ) ) = 2 K.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt( 2 K )

= c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) )

= c * ( A sqrt( k/m ) ) / c )

= A sqrt( k/m )

Which is correct for the non-relativistic case. So option D's non-rel limit is correct.

Earlier, my expression for v was c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )

Which in non-rel limit, when (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) is small,

v ≈ c * sqrt( 1 - 0 ) = c.

Which is not correct because non-rel limit should be v_max = sqrt( k A^2 /m )

But this suggests that either my initial approach is wrong or option D is correct.

Wait, but the non-rel limit can't have v_max approach c, because the non-rel v_max is sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is much less than c.

So, that suggests that option D is correct because it correctly reduces to the non-rel case, while my initial approach may have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy setup. Let me think again: the total energy is E = gamma m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = (1/2)k A^2/(m c^2 )

Which is correct.

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

Which can be rewritten as,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) ]

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )

But when K = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, the numerator becomes (2 m c^2 K - 2 m c^2 ) → 2 m c^2 ( K -1 )

Which would make v approach zero, which can't be correct.

Hmm, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion that option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the non-rel limit of option D.

Wait, option D's v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + K )^2 ), where K = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

When K is small,

1/(1 + K )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 K + 3 K^2 - ... → approximately 1 - 2 K.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + K )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 K ) = 2 K.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt(2 K )

= c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

= c * sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( (k A^2 m c^2 )/(m c^2 ) )

Wait, no,

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) * 2 )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) )

= c * [ sqrt( k A^2 ) ] / (c sqrt(m) )

= (A sqrt( k ) ) / sqrt( m )

Which is the non-relativistic v_max.

So, option D correctly reduces to the non-rel case, while my initial expression seems to not do that, which suggests that my initial approach is wrong.

So, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should use the virial theorem correctly in the relativistic case. But I'm not familiar with the virial theorem for relativistic oscillators.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the maximum speed is achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which in relativistic terms is:

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )

But looking at the options, option D's expression, when K is small, gives the correct non-rel limit. So perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, but from the initial setup, the correct expression is v = c * sqrt(1 - (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )

Which can be written as,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )

But this expression doesn't match any of the options, but option D's expression reduces correctly in the non-rel limit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy equation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) → which would be gamma.

So,

gamma = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 ) ]

So,

v = c sqrt( (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 ) ) / (k A )

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps one of the options can be rewritten in this form.

Option D's expression: v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + K )^2 ), K = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

= c * sqrt( ( (1 + K )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + K )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1 + 2 K + K^2 - 1 ) / (1 + K )^2 )

= c * sqrt( 2 K + K^2 ) / (1 + K )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ) / ( 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is D, as it's the only one that correctly reduces to the non-rel limit.

So, after this long process, I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the problem using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Setup**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential energy:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all energy is relativistic kinetic energy plus the rest energy:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]  
   Equating these, we find:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

2. **Expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   From \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{2mc^2}{kA^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{2mc^2}{kA^2} \right)
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{2mc^2}{kA^2}}
   \]  

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   Each option is analyzed to see if it matches the derived expression or reduces correctly in the non-relativistic limit (\( v \ll c \)).

   - **Option A**:  
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}\right)^2}}
     \]  
     The term \( \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) is not dimensionless, making this option invalid.

   - **Option B**:  
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)}}
     \]  
     In the non-relativistic limit (\( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \to 0 \)), this reduces to \( v_{\text{max}} \to c \sqrt{2} \), which is inconsistent with the non-relativistic result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \). Thus, this option is incorrect.

   - **Option C**:  
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}}
     \]  
     This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects. Hence, it is incorrect for the relativistic case.

   - **Option D**:  
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
     \]  
     Let \( K = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{(1 + K)^2 - 1}{(1 + K)^2}} = c \sqrt{\frac{2K + K^2}{(1 + K)^2}}
     \]  
     In the non-relativistic limit (\( K \to 0 \)):  
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} \approx c \sqrt{2K} = c \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}}
     \]  
     This matches the non-relativistic result, confirming that Option D is correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it correctly accounts for relativistic effects and reduces to the non-relativistic result in the appropriate limit.

**Answer: D**
