Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and someone wants to study their developmental fate. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, I remember bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one construct. The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. Oh, IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry, so it allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a second ribosome binding site. So the ligand is expressed via the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand? Or maybe the other way around? Wait, the question says the ligand is at the 5' position, so the vector is ligand first, then receptor. So the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES is before the receptor. So the expression is probably ligand from CBA, and receptor from IRES, which would allow for co-expression but perhaps in a different way.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Oh, so that's a stop cassette. I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette is in place, preventing the downstream mCherry from being expressed. Wait, no, no. If the stop is between ligand and mCherry, then mCherry would only be expressed if the stop is removed. But the vector is bicistronic, so maybe each gene is under its own control.

Wait, the ligand has ORF fused to mCherry. So the ligand is in frame with mCherry? Or is it that mCherry is a reporter for ligand expression? Because the stop is between the ligand ORF and mCherry, and that's in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the stop is present, so mCherry isn't expressed. But if Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, and between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So eGFP is only expressed when Cre is present to excise that stop. Wait, but in the question, the mice are being crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor active in neural crest derivatives, like in astrocytes.

But the setup is that the person made a bicistronic vector with ligand and receptor, each with their own fluorescent tags. Then they transfected primary astrocyte cultures and did Western blot. But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre, and looked for eGFP under the confocal, there was no green signal.

So, the question is why no green signal? The possible options are A to D.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression of the receptor-eGFP in the same cells. If they're paracrine, maybe the ligand is produced by one cell and the receptor by another, but the construct is a bicistronic vector. If the vector is properly expressed, both ligand and receptor should be in same cells. So if the ligand is secreted or membrane-bound, it might act on neighboring cells. But the question is about the expression of eGFP, which is part of the receptor construct. So maybe this isn't the main issue here. So perhaps A is not the right answer.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the eGFP wouldn't be on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm, but if it's stuck in Golgi, maybe it's not expressed or visible. But the presence of eGFP would require proper processing. If it's stuck, perhaps it's not fluorescent. But how would the Western blot look? The antibodies were against overexpressed proteins, so in Western, they probably see the proteins. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which suggests the proteins are being expressed. So if the proteins are expressed and processed, but the GFP is not visible, perhaps it's because of improper processing. Or maybe it's a matter of when the cells are fixed. Hmm, but the question mentions that the mouse model is homozygous, so the construct is present in all cells. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a neural crest derivative, so the Cre would excise the stops in the vector. So in the astrocyte cultures, the Cre would have been present, and the eGFP would be expressed. But the Western blot showed the proteins, but in the mouse, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't visible. Maybe the issue is that the GFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector has the stop between receptor and eGFP in a lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre would be a transactivator in neural crest-derived cells, so the Cre would recombine the lox2272 sites, allowing the eGFP to be expressed. So in the mouse, the construct would be activated in SOX10-expressing cells, which are neural crest-derived, like astrocytes.

So why no eGFP? Let's think about the options.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter but relies on the upstream gene's expression. So if the promoter is missing, but the CBA is there, perhaps the ligand is expressed, but maybe the receptor isn't. But the question is about eGFP, which is part of the receptor construct. So if the receptor is not expressed, the eGFP wouldn't be. But the CBA promoter is for ligand, and the receptor is IRES-driven. So in the presence of Cre, both the ligand and receptor should be expressed. Unless the IRES isn't working. Hmm, but option C says the enhancer is missing. Wait, the CBA promoter is a strong promoter and doesn't require enhancers. So perhaps C is not correct.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's a possibility. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed because the frameshift would cause a premature stop codon, or the entire construct would be messed up. So if the receptor's ORF is in frame, but the eGFP is not, then when the stop is excised, the eGFP may not be expressed correctly.

Wait, the construct is that the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is followed by eGFP, but in the same reading frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP would be expressed after the receptor. But if the frames are not correct, the eGFP would not express. So maybe the cloning was done incorrectly, causing the eGFP to be in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not expressed.

In the question, the Western blot was done on total proteins after plasmid transfection. Did that show eGFP expression? The question says that the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin, but I'm not sure if it detected eGFP. The antibodies were against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe the eGFP was not the target. Wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. So the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins.

So in the Western, perhaps the ligand and receptor proteins were detected, but not the GFP. But I'm not sure about that. The question says that after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to do the Western. So perhaps the construct's proteins were expressed, but the GFP wasn't because of the frame. But in the mouse, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, they would have the same construct, and the eGFP should be expressed only in the presence of Cre. But in the mouse, no green signal. So perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the construct is out of frame.

Alternatively, could it be that the IRES is not working? IRES elements are used to allow for the expression of a second gene without a polyA signal, but the issue here is perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed.

Wait, the lox2272 is a variant of loxP, with a different recognition site. Cre recombinase can recognize loxP and lox2272 sites, but they won't recombine between loxP and lox2272. So in the construct, the ligand's stop is between loxP sites, and the receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites. So when Cre is present, it will recombine each pair, excising the stops.

For the ligand/mCherry: the stop is between ligand and mCherry, in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed.

For the receptor/eGFP: the stop is between receptor and eGFP in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Cre will recognize the lox2272 sites and excise the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

If the frame is correct, then the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed. But if the frame is incorrect, then the eGFP won't be expressed, perhaps because the stop remains or because the ORF is messed up.

So if the frame is not correct (option D), then the eGFP won't be expressed even after Cre excises the stop. So when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stop between receptor and eGFP, but if the ORF is not in the same frame, then eGFP isn't expressed.

In the Western blot, they only tested the proteins, not GFP. So the eGFP may not have been detected, but the receptor and ligand were.

In the confocal, no green signal suggests no eGFP expression. So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the ORF is not in frame.

Another possibility is that the construct is not expressed in the right cells. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest-derived cells, which include astrocytes. So if the construct were correctly expressed, the eGFP should be visible in those cells.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the stop cassettes are between the ORFs. So without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the downstream reporter (mCherry and eGFP) from being expressed. With Cre, the stops are removed, so the reporters are expressed.

So in the mouse, when Cre is present, the stops are removed. So in the mouse, the eGFP should be expressed in SOX10-positive cells. Since it's not, the issue must be that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Which could be due to a frameshift.

So the answer is D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) fused to their respective ORFs. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) are placed between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. SOX10-Cre mice are used to activate expression in neural crest-derived cells. Despite this, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both proteins in the same cell, as it is a bicistronic vector. The absence of eGFP fluorescence is not explained by a paracrine relationship. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, and eGFP would not be visible. However, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the proteins are being expressed. This suggests that the construct is being processed and transported, making this option less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES regulatory element. The CBA promoter does not require an enhancer for expression. The absence of eGFP fluorescence is not due to a missing enhancer. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. The lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette would be excised by Cre, but the frameshift would prevent proper expression of eGFP. This would result in no green signal under confocal microscopy, consistent with the observed results. This is the most likely explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of a green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
