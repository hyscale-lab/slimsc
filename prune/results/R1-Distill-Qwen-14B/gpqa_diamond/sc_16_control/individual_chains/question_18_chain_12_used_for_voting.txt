Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we've got two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses compared to the Sun. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

First, let me understand the given data. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, assuming LTE. 

The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, which means the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. 

Then, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so magnesium relative to hydrogen is solar as well.

Wait, but what about the photospheric composition of the Sun? The Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, if I rearrange that, log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Which means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log10(nMg/nH) = -5, so nMg/nH =10^(-5). 

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So, I need [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], or the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2.

Wait, actually, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

How do I get [Si] for each star? Let's think. 

We have [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2. Hmm, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star, then take their ratio.

Wait, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means [Fe/H] = 0, so [Fe] = [H]. So, [Si]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3. So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. But we need [Si/H]_2. Hmm. Let's see. What else do we have? [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so [Mg]_2 = [H]_2. 

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg]_2 / [Si]_2 = (0) [since [Mg/H]_2 =0? Wait, wait. Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ). 

Wait, so for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. Which means (Mg/Si)_2 / (Mg/Si)_sun = 10^0.3. 

We know (Mg/Si)_sun is (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = (nMg/nSi) ) because the H cancels. So, nMg/nH is 1e-5, and we need nSi/nH. Hmm, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] is given? Wait, no, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, nFe/H is 1e-4.5. But how about [Si/Fe]_sun? Wait, that's not given. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, maybe I can express [Si/H] for each star in terms of the Sun's composition.

Let me think again. 

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, [Si]_1 = [Fe]_1 * 10^0.3.
But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so [Fe]_1 = [H]_1 (since [Fe/H] is the log of (Fe/H)/(Fe/Sun H) ), but wait, perhaps [Fe/H]_1 = 0 means that the abundance ratio (Fe/H)_star1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So, [Fe/H]_1 is log( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun ) )=0, so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So, [Fe]_1 = [H]_1 * (Fe/H)_sun.

Wait, maybe I should express all abundances in terms of the Sun's ratios.

Let me denote for the Sun, [X/H]_sun = (nX/nH)_sun.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 => (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So, [Fe]_1 = [H]_1 * (Fe/H)_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 => (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun * 10^0.3. 

But (Si/Fe)_1 = [Si]_1/[Fe]_1 = ( [Si]_1 / [H]_1 ) / ( [Fe]_1 / [H]_1 ) ) = [Si/H]_1 / [Fe/H]_1. 

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so the ratio [Fe/H]_1 is solar. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute [Si/H]_star and [Si/H]_sun, then find their ratio.

Alternatively, let's compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 => log10( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun ) ) =0.3. So, (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But (Si/Fe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun, which is log10( (nSi/nFe)_sun ). Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm. Maybe I can compute that from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = -4.5, so nFe/nH = 3.16e-5. 

Similarly, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So, log(nMg/nH) =-5, so nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? The problem doesn't directly give it. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Mg/Si] ratio. Because for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So, perhaps (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/Si)_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, but without knowing the solar [Mg/Si], I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Mg/Si] in terms of [Mg/H] and [Si/H].

Wait, [Mg/Si]_star = log10( (nMg/nSi)_star / (nMg/nSi)_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Which implies that (nMg/nSi)_star = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3.

But (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = (nMg/nH) * (nH/nSi) ) = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = (nMg/(nSi)).

Wait, but I don't know nSi/nH for the Sun. So perhaps we need another approach.

Wait, let's think about the problem differently. Maybe the mass of the stars isn't directly relevant here, as the question is about elemental abundances, not their evolution. So, perhaps I can focus on the given abundance ratios.

The problem is to find the ratio [Si]_1 / [Si]_2. That is, the number of silicon atoms per hydrogen in Star_1 divided by that in Star_2.

Wait, but how?

Wait, [X]_star = log10(nX/nH)_star - log10(nX/nH)_sun.

So, [X]_star = log10( (nX/nH)_star / (nX/nH)_sun ) ).

So, for Star_1, [Si]_1 = log10( (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ).

Similarly for Star_2, [Si]_2 = log10( (nSi2/nH2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ).

The ratio of the silicon atoms, [nSi1/nH1] / [nSi2/nH2] = 10^[Si]_1 - [Si]_2.

Wait, but how do I find [Si]_1 and [Si]_2?

Let's tackle Star_1 first.

Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. Which is log10( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun ) )=0.3.

(Si/Fe)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1 =0, which implies (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So, (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

Wait, in terms of nFe, (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun * (H/H_sun) )? Because [Fe/H] is log( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun )=0, so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

Wait, but (nFe)_1 = (Fe/H)_1 * (nH)_1.

Similarly, (nFe)_sun = (Fe/H)_sun * (nH)_sun.

So, (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun => (nFe)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun * (nH)_1.

But without knowing the absolute number of H in the stars, perhaps it's better to work with ratios.

We need to find (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = ?

Let me write expressions for (nSi1/nH1) and (nSi2/nH2) in terms of the given data.

Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

(Si/Fe)_1 = (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) =10^0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ). So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, nFe_sun = (nFe_sun) = (Fe/H)_sun * nH_sun.

So, (nSi1 / nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Wait, substituting nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) * nH1.

So, nSi1 / nFe1 = [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) ].

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) * nH1 => nFe1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH1.

Wait, but (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = (Fe/H)_sun.

So, (nSi1 / nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) ).

Thus,

nSi1 = (nFe1) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) ).

Substituting nFe1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH1,

nSi1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) ).

But (Fe/H)_sun = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So,

nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun ) * nH1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) ).

Simplify:

The nFe_sun cancels. So,

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun ) ).

So,

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

Thus,

nSi1 / nH1 = (10^0.3 * nSi_sun ) / nH_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun ) * (1/nH1) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this tangled. Let's think of (nSi1/nH1) in terms of (nSi_sun/nH_sun) and other terms.

Wait, nSi1/nH1 = (nSi1/nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nH1) ) ?

Alternatively, let me express nSi1/nH1 in terms of the Sun's values.

From the above, nSi1 = [ (Fe/H)_sun * nH1 ] * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) )

Wait, (Fe/H)_sun = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

So,

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun / nH_sun ) * nH1 ] * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) )

Simplify:

nFe_sun cancels with 1/nFe_sun.

So,

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

Thus,

nSi1 / nH1 = [ (nH1 / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ] / nH1 ) 

= (10^0.3 * nSi_sun ) / nH_sun.

But (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) is (nSi/nH)_sun, which is 10^([Si/H]_sun).

Wait, but what is [Si/H]_sun?

Because [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - 12.

Wait, for the Sun, [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 => log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 => nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 => log(nMg/nH)=-5 => nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about [Si/H]_sun? The problem doesn't give it. Hmm. So perhaps I need to find it based on the given data, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun from the solar abundances. Because [Si/Fe]_sun = log10( (nSi/nFe)_sun ). 

But I don't have nSi/nFe for the Sun. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 in terms of other known ratios.

Let me think again.

For Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So, [Fe/H]_1=0 implies that (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

But [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 => (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun *10^0.3.

So,

(Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun *10^0.3 * (Fe/H)_sun.

But (Fe/H)_sun is known: from the solar data, [Fe/H]_sun = log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5.

Wait, no. Wait, the given is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 =-4.5, so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16e-5.

So, (Fe/H)_sun = nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

Similarly, (Si/H)_sun is nSi/nH =10^([Si/H]_sun +12). Because [X/H] =12 + log(nX/nH), so log(nX/nH) = [X/H] -12, so nX/nH=10^{[X/H]-12}.

But [Si/H]_sun is not given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun from the given [Mg/Si]_2 and other ratios, but that seems unclear.

Wait, another approach. Since [Fe/H]_1=0, all elements in Star_1 have the same [X/H] as the Sun except for those whose ratios differ. Hmm, but for Star_1, silicon is enhanced relative to iron.

Wait, maybe I can write [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1. Because [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

[X/H] = log(nX/nH) -12.

So, [X/Y] = log( (nX/nH) / (nY/nH) ) -12 = log( nX/nY ) ) = log(nX/nY).

So, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

So, in Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1.

Given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Wait, that changes things. So, the [Si/H] abundance for Star_1 is 0.3. 

Similarly, for Star_2, maybe we can find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

Given that [Mg/H]_2 =0, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2.

Wait, no. [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So, 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so:

0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that would imply that the silicon abundance is lower in Star_2 relative to the Sun.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) =10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

Because [Si/H] = log10(nSi/nH) -12.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi1/nH1) -12.

[Si/H]_2 = log10(nSi2/nH2) -12.

So, [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10(nSi1/nH1) - log10(nSi2/nH2) ) = log10( (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ).

Thus, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

So, plugging in [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2=-0.3,

Ratio=10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

Which is approximately 4. So, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

Wait, that seems to make sense. Let me double-check.

For Star_1: [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, the ratio is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So, the answer should be approximately 3.9, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the given elemental abundances and logarithmic notation. The abundance ratios are defined as:

\[
[X/Y]_{\text{star}} = \log_{10}\left(\frac{X/Y}{X/Y}_{\odot}\right),
\]

where \(X\) and \(Y\) are elements, and the subscript \(\odot\) denotes solar values. The goal is to calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2}} = 10^{\left([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2\right)}.
\]

### Step 1: Determine \([{\text{Si/H}}]_1\) for Star_1
For Star_1, the given abundance ratios are \([{\text{Si/Fe}}]_1 = 0.3\) and \([{\text{Fe/H}}]_1 = 0\). Using the relationship:

\[
[{\text{Si/Fe}}]_1 = [{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Fe/H}}]_1,
\]

and knowing \([{\text{Fe/H}}]_1 = 0\), we find:

\[
[{\text{Si/H}}]_1 = 0.3.
\]

### Step 2: Determine \([{\text{Si/H}}]_2\) for Star_2
For Star_2, the given abundance ratios are \([{\text{Mg/Si}}]_2 = 0.3\) and \([{\text{Mg/H}}]_2 = 0\). Using the relationship:

\[
[{\text{Mg/Si}}]_2 = [{\text{Mg/H}}]_2 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2,
\]

and knowing \([{\text{Mg/H}}]_2 = 0\), we find:

\[
[{\text{Si/H}}]_2 = -0.3.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2}} = 10^{\left([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2\right)}.
\]

Substituting \([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 = 0.3\) and \([{\text{Si/H}}]_2 = -0.3\):

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}/n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}/n_{\text{H},2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio of silicon atoms is approximately \(3.9\).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is closest to **3.9**, corresponding to option **A**.
