Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes are related to partial waves, and each partial wave has a phase shift. The question gives me several phase shifts, and I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the formula... Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. The general formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ), where the sum is over l, and δ_l are the phase shifts.

Since the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, that should be when θ is 0 degrees because that's the direction of the incident beam. So, cosθ would be 1. And P_l(1) is 1 for all l because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) = 1. Oh wait, right, because P_l(1) is 1 for any l.

So the expression simplifies to f(θ=0) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * 1 ). And since we're looking for the imaginary part, I need to find the imaginary component of this sum.

Breaking it down: e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when I multiply that by (2l +1) sin δ_l, the imaginary part comes from the i sin δ_l * (2l +1) sin δ_l * cos δ_l term? Wait, no, let's think again. The term is (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. Let me expand that.

e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. Multiply by sin δ_l: sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l. So the imaginary part of each term is (2l +1) * sin² δ_l.

Wait no, wait. The term is (2l +1) [ sin δ_l * e^{iδ_l} ]. Alternatively, it's (2l +1) sin δ_l [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l]. So when you multiply, you get (2l +1) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So the imaginary part for each term is (2l +1) sin² δ_l. Then the total imaginary part is the sum over all l of (2l +1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, but in the problem, do they give us all the necessary phase shifts? The question says to ignore the rest, so I guess only the given δ's are considered. So δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. Oh, wait, the phase shifts are labeled as δ0, δ1 up to δ4. So l goes from 0 to 4 in this case.

So each term in the sum is (2l +1) * sin² δl. Let me compute each term:

l=0: 2(0)+1=1. sin(90°) is 1. So 1 * 1^2 = 1.

l=1: 2(1)+1=3. sin(67°) ≈ sin(67) is about 0.9205. So 0.9205 squared is approximately 0.847. Multiply by 3: 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5. sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192. Square is ~0.671. 5 * 0.671 ≈ 3.355.

l=3: (2*3+1)=7. sin(30°) is 0.5. Squared is 0.25. 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9. sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495. Squared is about 0.0506. 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.455.

Now add all these up:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541

3.541 +3.355=6.896

6.896 +1.75=8.646

8.646 +0.455≈9.101.

So the sum is approximately 9.101.

Now, the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/k) multiplied by this sum. But wait, what's k? k is the wave number. The electrons have energy E=50 MeV. Hmm, electrons are relativistic, so I need to compute their momentum.

The energy E of an electron is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). For non-relativistic, E≈pc, but 50 MeV is a high energy. So let's compute p.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV.

Electron mass m = 0.511 MeV/c². So m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So E² = (pc)^2 + (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

Solving for pc: pc = sqrt(E² - (0.511)^2) → sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So pc ≈49.997 MeV → p = (49.997 MeV)/(c) → since MeV = eV, and c is in m/s.

But wait, the wave number k is given by p/(ħ). Hmm, so let's compute k.

But let's do it step by step. First, let me compute p.

p = (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / c^2 * c → p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c).

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c^2 * c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. But perhaps it's easier to compute p in terms of E and m.

Wait, another approach, in natural units where c=1, E² = p² + m².

So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Here, E is in MeV, m =0.511 MeV.

So E =50 MeV → p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.26) → sqrt(2499.74) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So p ≈49.997 MeV/c.

Now, the wave number k is given by p/(ħ c) ? Wait, no, the relation is k = p/(ħ), because in quantum mechanics, the wavevector k is related to momentum p by p = ħ k.

Wait, no, that's correct: p = ħ k → k = p/(ħ). But we have p in MeV/c units. So let me make sure about the units.

Wait, let's convert p into units of inverse femtometers, since the answer is in fm. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

So ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 MeV·s. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, but ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s. Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the conversion factors.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about this. Let me compute k in units of inverse femtometers.

First, p = 49.997 MeV/c. Let's compute p in kg·m/s.

1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J. So 49.997 MeV = 49.997 *1.602e-13 J = approx 8.0e-12 J.

p = (8.0e-12 J) / c. Since c is approx 3e8 m/s, p ≈ (8e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s) → 2.67e-20 kg·m/s.

Wait, because 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². So J/s = kg·m/s.

Wait, so p = energy / c → 49.997 MeV/c → MeV is converted into J, then divided by c.

But perhaps a better approach is to convert p into reciprocal femtometers, since the options are in fm.

Because 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, knowing that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Because ħ is about 6.582e-16 MeV·s, c is 3e8 m/s → ħ c ≈ 6.582e-16 MeV·s * 3e8 m/s → 6.582e-16 *3e8 = 1.9746e-7 MeV·m → which is 197.46 MeV·fm (since 1 m =1e15 fm). So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

Therefore, k = p/(ħ) → but using units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p/(ħ) = (p c)/(ħ c) = (p c) / (197.33 MeV·fm).

Wait, p is in MeV/c. So p c is (MeV/c) * c = MeV.

So k = (p c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) → which gives k in 1/fm.

So with p c ≈49.997 MeV, k = 49.997 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

Wait, let me compute that again. 50 / 197.33 is approximately 0.2535 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

So the imaginary part of the amplitude is sum * (1/k) → sum is about 9.101, 1/k is approx 3.947 fm.

So 9.101 * 3.947 ≈ Let's compute that.

9 *3.947 = 35.523, 0.101 *3.947 ≈0.4, so total is about 35.923 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times bigger. Did I miss a factor?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check how k is calculated.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

But p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm.

Wait, another approach: since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ) = c/(197.33 MeV·fm).

p is in MeV/c. So k = p/(ħ) = (MeV/c) * c/(197.33 MeV·fm) ) = (MeV c )/(c * 197.33 MeV fm) ) → the c's cancel, MeV cancels, so k = (1) / (197.33 fm) ) → Wait, wait, wait, perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, p is in MeV/c. So when you compute k = p/(ħ), you have to express ħ in units that make the units compatible.

So, since ħ has units of MeV·fm (because ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ is (197.33 MeV·fm)/c ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me convert p into MeV/c, and ħ in MeV·fm, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But when calculating k = p/(ħ), the units would be (MeV/c) divided by (MeV·fm / c) ) → units: (MeV/c) * (c/(MeV·fm)) ) → (1/fm). So the units work out.

So, p = 49.997 MeV/c.

ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

So k = p / ħ = [49.997 MeV/c ] / [ (197.33 MeV·fm ) / c ) ] → the c's cancel, MeV cancels, so we have (49.997)/(197.33 fm) → which is approximately 0.2535 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k is approximately 3.947 fm.

So the imaginary part is sum * (1/k) → 9.101 * 3.947 ≈ let me compute that.

9 *3.947=35.523, 0.101 *3.947≈0.4, sum≈35.923 fm. Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 35.9 is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Wait, where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, maybe I forgot a factor. Because the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but in the formula, the sum is (2l +1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}, but when you take the imaginary part, it's (2l +1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l? Or wait, no—earlier, I think I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me re-examine the expansion.

The term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So when you multiply by sin δ_l, you get sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l +1) (i sin² δ_l). So when you sum over all l, the imaginary part is sum [ (2l +1) sin² δ_l ].

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Let me recalculate the sum:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. sin(90)=1. sin^2=1. So 1*1=1.

l=1: 3. sin(67)= approx 0.9205. (0.9205)^2=0.8473. 3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5. sin(55)=~0.8192. Square is 0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7. sin(30)=0.5. Square is 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. sin(13)=~0.22495. Square is ~0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Adding them: 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is about 9.1023.

Then, 1/k is 3.947 fm.

So 9.1023 *3.947 ≈? 9 *3.947 =35.523, 0.1023*3.947≈0.403. Total≈35.926 fm.

Hmm, that would be about 35.9 fm, but options don't have that. The closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times bigger.

Wait, so did I make a mistake in calculating k?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let's recheck.

Earlier, I thought that k = p/(ħ) → but perhaps I should have used the correct value of ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 MeV·s. So if p is in MeV/c, then let's compute k.

Because, k = p/(ħ) → but in terms of units, since ħ has units of MeV·s, and p is in MeV/c, the units would be:

(MeV/c) / (MeV·s) ) = (1/(c s)) → which is not the same as 1/m, which is the unit for k.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted p into kg·m/s, then divided by ħ in J·s (which is kg·m²/s) to get k in 1/m.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

So let's compute k correctly.

First, compute p in kg·m/s.

E =50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-13 J = 50e6 *1.602e-13 = 8.01e-7 J.

Wait, E = pc → p = E/(c) → E=8.01e-7 J → p =8.01e-7 J / (3e8 m/s) → p=2.67e-15 kg·m/s.

Wait, 1 J =1 kg·m²/s² → J/s = kg·m/s.

So p= E/(c) = (8.01e-7 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approx 2.67e-15 kg m/s.

Now, compute k = p / ħ.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (2.67e-15 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) → J = kg m²/s² → so J·s = kg m²/s.

So, units: (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → 1/(m).

So k = 2.67e-15 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.53e19 m^-1.

Wait, that's a huge number. But 1 meter is 1e15 fm (since 1 fm=1e-15 m). So 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm^-1.

So, 2.53e19 m^-1 = 2.53e19 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e4 fm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right because that's 25300 fm^-1, making 1/k = 3.95e-5 fm.

But when I earlier calculated 1/k as 3.947 fm, which is way bigger. But here, it's 3.95e-5 fm, which is way smaller. That's conflicting.

Hmm, I think I'm getting conflicting results because of unit conversion errors. Maybe I should take another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the momentum transfer.

Wait, another approach: The wave number k is related to the energy of the electrons. The electrons have energy E=50 MeV, so their momentum is p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2 * c.

Wait, perhaps another way to compute k is using the relation between the electron's wavelength and momentum. The wavelength λ is 2πħ / p.

But I'm getting stuck on the correct k calculation. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for electrons, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), assuming non-relativistic speeds. But E=50 MeV for an electron is definitely relativistic, so that formula won't apply. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe in this problem, we can use the fact that for high energies, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.

So, E=50 MeV → p ≈50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) → but in terms of units, I need to have p in the same units as ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 MeV·s.

So, p in MeV/c → 50 MeV/c.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (6.582e-16 MeV·s) ) → units: (MeV/c) * (s) / (MeV) ) → s/(c).

Because (MeV/c) / (MeV·s) ) → 1/(c s).

Hmm, but we need k in 1/fm. So let me convert s/(c) into fm.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s = 3e23 fm/s (since 1 m =1e15 fm).

So, s/(c) → s / (3e23 fm/s) ) → s^2/(3e23 fm) → that's not helpful. I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in 1/m.

So, p =50 MeV/c.

Convert p into kg m/s:

1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J = 1.602e-13 kg m²/s².

So p =50 MeV/c = 50 * 1.602e-13 kg m²/s² / (3e8 m/s) )= (8.01e-12 kg m²/s²) / (3e8 m/s) )= 2.67e-20 kg m/s.

Then, k = p / ħ → ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = (2.67e-20 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s) ) = 2.53e14 m^-1.

Wait, that's 2.53e14 m^-1. So 1/k is approx 3.95e-15 m.

But 1 m is 1e15 fm → 3.95e-15 m = 3.95e-30 fm? No, wait.

Wait, no, 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So 2.53e14 m^-1 = 2.53e14 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-1 fm^-1 → which is 0.253 fm^-1.

Which brings us back to the earlier value of k ≈0.253 fm^-1, so 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

So that's the same as before. So the imaginary part is sum * (1/k) → 9.1023 *3.95 ≈36 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13.

Wait, wait, when l=0, the term is (2l+1)=1, sin(90)=1. So 1*1=1.

l=1: 3, sin(67)². Let me compute sin(67) more accurately.

sin(67 degrees) is approximately 0.92050485345.

(0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.8473. 3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2: 5, sin(55)= approx 0.81915204428.

(0.81915)^2 ≈ 0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7, sin(30)=0.5. Square is 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9, sin(13)= approx 0.2249510543.

(0.22495)^2 ≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Summing: 1+2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is 9.1023.

Now, 9.1023 *3.947 fm = ?

3.947 *9.1023 → Let's compute this accurately.

3 *9.1023 =27.3069.

0.947 *9.1023 → let's compute 0.9 *9.1023=8.19207, 0.047 *9.1023≈0.42781. Sum=8.19207+0.42781=8.61988.

Total =27.3069 +8.61988=35.92678 fm.

So about 35.9 fm.

But wait, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift assumption. Oh wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4, so l runs from 0 to 4 as given.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude is (1/k) multiplied by the sum, but perhaps I need to multiply by something else.

Wait, in the formula, f(θ=0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

But we have the sum as 9.1023, and 1/k is 3.947 fm.

Wait, but perhaps the scattering amplitude is in units of fm, so 35.9 fm. But none of the options match that.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, the general formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) ) ? Or perhaps I have the wrong factor.

Wait, another source of confusion: sometimes the scattering amplitude is written with a 1/k factor, sometimes with a (1/(2ik)) factor.

Wait, let me think. The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ,φ) = Σ ( (2l+1) ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) P_l(cosθ) ).

Wait, another version: f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ).

So perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ).

So in our case, θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Which means the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

But the result I got is about 35.9 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the mistake is in the way I computed k.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation 1/k = (ħ c)/(p), because p = ħ k → k = p/ħ → 1/k = ħ/(p).

So, 1/k = ħ c / (p c).

Wait, because ħ c is in units of MeV·fm, p is in MeV/c → p c is MeV.

So, 1/k = (ħ c) / (p c) ) → (197.33 MeV·fm) / (49.997 MeV ) → 197.33 /49.997 ≈3.947 fm.

So 1/k=3.947 fm.

So that part was correct.

Hmm. Then the sum is about 9.1023. So 9.1023 *3.947=35.92 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate sin^2 for each δ.

Let me recompute each term:

l=0: sin^2(90)=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1: sin(67)=approx 0.9205 → (0.9205)^2=0.8473 → 3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192 → square≈0.671 →5 *0.671=3.355.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 → square=0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4: sin(13)=0.22495 → square≈0.0506 →9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is 1+2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

That's correct.

Hmm. Then perhaps I messed up the units because the answer is supposed to be in fm, but perhaps I need to multiply by something else.

Wait, another possibility: the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum, but perhaps the sum is in a different unit.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 1/k accurately.

p c =49.997 MeV.

ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So 1/k= (ħ c)/p c = (197.33 MeV·fm)/(49.997 MeV) ) → 197.33 /49.997 ≈3.947 fm.

Yes.

So 9.1023 *3.947=35.92 fm.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B)355.351 fm, which is about 10 times bigger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, 197.33 /49.997 is approx 3.947. Wait, 49.997 is almost 50. So 197.33/50 is 3.9466.

So 1/k=3.9466 fm.

Now, 9.1023 *3.9466 = let me compute this:

9 *3.9466 =35.5194.

0.1023 *3.9466 ≈0.403.

Total ≈35.922 fm.

Hmm, not matching any option. Could I have messed up the formula? Like using the real part instead of the imaginary?

Wait, the question specifically says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Another source says that the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(l) = (1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) → which is (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) / (2ik).

But the imaginary part would be (e^{2iδ} -1 )/(2ik) → the imaginary part of this is [ sin(2δ) ]/(2k).

Wait, but that's for each partial wave. So the total imaginary part would be sum over l [ (2l+1) (sin(2δ_l)) ] / (2k).

Wait, but I'm getting confused because different sources present the formula differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Im(f) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ sin^2 δ_l ].

Which is what I did earlier.

If that's correct, then the result is about 35.9 fm, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, let me try to compute the sum again.

l=0: 1 *1=1.

l=1:3*(sin67)^2.

Sin67 degrees is 0.9205, square is 0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2.

Sin55≈0.8192, square≈0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7*(sin30)^2.

Sin30=0.5, square=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(sin13)^2.

Sin13≈0.22495, square≈0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum: 1 + 2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the result in units of 1e3 fm or something, but that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude is in units of fm, but perhaps the actual formula includes a factor I missed.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude f is usually in units of (fm)^{-1}, since it's a measure of cross-section per unit solid angle. But when you calculate it, you get it in fm.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part in units of fm, which is what I did.

Wait, the options are all much larger than my result, except for option B) which is about 355 fm, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 91 instead of 9.1? Because 35.9 *10=359, which is close to option B's 355.351.

But why would the sum be 91 and not 9.1? Let me think: perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? No, the question states degrees, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the sum. Let me compute each term again.

Wait, l=0: (2l+1)=1, sin^2(90)=1 → 1.

l=1:3, sin(67)=0.9205 → square=0.8473 → 3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5, sin(55)=0.8192 → square=0.671 → 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7, sin(30)=0.5 → square=0.25 →7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9, sin(13)=0.22495 → square=0.0506 →9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum =1+2.5419+3.355+1.75+0.4554= 9.1013.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k. Maybe I should compute k using the relativistic formula.

Wait, the relativistic energy E = gamma m c^2.

p = gamma m v.

v = beta c.

So, p = gamma m beta c.

But, for high energy electrons, beta is approximately 1.

So, p = gamma m c.

But E = gamma m c^2 → gamma = E/(m c^2).

So, p = (E/(m c^2)) * m c → E/(c).

So p = E/c.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Given that I can't find any mistake in the calculation, but the result isn't matching any option, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula Im(f) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which would change the sum.

Let me compute each term as (2l+1)* sin(2δ_l):

l=0:1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * sin(134)=3 *0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.0073=2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Then, Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * 16.7134.

Since 1/k=3.947 fm, 1/(2k)=1.9735 fm.

So 16.7134 *1.9735 ≈33.0 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would sum to:

1*1=1.

3*sin67≈3*0.9205=2.7615.

5*sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

7*sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

9*sin13≈9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

Then, Im(f)=13.382 *3.947≈52.9 fm.

Still not matching any option.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part is related to the optical theorem, which connects it to the total cross-section. But perhaps that's making it more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, but that would just be the same as (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l).

So the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Which is half of what I calculated earlier.

So sum is 9.1023, so (9.1023/2)*3.947=4.55115 *3.947≈18.0 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Now I'm really confused. Perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4. The problem states 'ignore rest of the phase shifts'—maybe they mean that higher l's are zero, but perhaps I should include more terms. But the problem gives only up to δ4, so I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l}.

Which would be (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) (cos 2δ_l + i sin 2δ_l).

The imaginary part would then be (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l.

Which is the same as what I computed earlier, giving 16.7134 * (1/(2k)).

Which with 1/k=3.947, 1/(2k)=1.9735.

16.7134 *1.9735 ≈33.0 fm.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}.

The imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So sum sin δ_l for each l:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

Im(f) = (13.382) * (1/(2k)) → 13.382 *1.9735 ≈26.43 fm.

Which is close to option D)251.271 fm, but still not matching.

But wait, 26.43 is not close to any option except D)251.271, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question states degrees. Let me check: No, the question says degrees, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplied by something else, like a factor of 10.

But that would be arbitrary.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. All my calculations point me to about 35.9 fm, but that's not an option. The closest option is B)355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 in the sum?

Wait, perhaps the sum should be 91.023 instead of 9.1023. How?

Ah, wait! I think I found the mistake. The phase shifts given are δ_o=90, δ_1=67, etc. But delta_0 is for l=0, delta_1 for l=1, etc. So when I summed, I included all l from 0 to 4. But perhaps the formula uses l starting from 1, or I miscounted.

Wait, no, the formula includes l=0 to l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) * l * sin^2 δ_l. But that would change everything, but I don't remember the formula including l as a multiplier.

Wait, the formula is (2l+1) multiplied by sin^2 δ_l.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) * (sin δ_l )^2 * cos(theta) ?

No, for theta=0, cos(theta)=1.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of the sum.

Wait, l=0:1*1=1 → correct.

l=1:3*(sin(67))^2 =3*(0.9205)^2≈3*0.8473=2.5419 → correct.

l=2:5*(0.8192)^2≈5*(0.671)=3.355 → correct.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75 → correct.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.0506=0.4554 → correct.

Sum=9.1023 → correct.

So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, and I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

k = p/(ħ) → p=50 MeV/c in natural units where c=1, so p=50 MeV.

But in terms of units with ħ=197.33 MeV·fm, k = p/(ħ) → 50 /197.33 ≈0.2535 fm^-1.

So 1/k=3.947 fm.

Sum=9.1023 → 9.1023 *3.947 ≈35.92 fm.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}.

Then, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l: as before, 13.382.

Im(f)=13.382/(2k) → 13.382/(2*0.2535 fm^{-1}) ) → 13.382/(0.507 fm^{-1}) ) →13.382 * 1.97 fm →26.43 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but the user said the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} instead of e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the amplitude is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So at θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Given that I can't figure out where the mistake is, but the calculation leads me to approximately 35.9 fm, which isn't an option, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) * (sin^2 δ_l) * (1/k), but I think I've already considered that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ħ c.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So perhaps if I used a different value, like 197.33 times a different factor, the result would change.

But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 1e-15 m, which is fm.

Wait, 35.9 fm is 35.9e-15 m.

But the options are A)87163.4 fm, which is 8.7e4 fm, which is way larger.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is 355.351 fm, which is option B. But that would require the sum to be 91 instead of 9.1.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question says degrees.

If I calculate delta in radians, let's see:

delta_0=90 degrees = pi/2 radians.

sin(pi/2)=1.

delta_1=67 degrees → radians: 67 * pi/180≈1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937)=0.9205.

So that's the same as before.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Since all my calculations lead to about 35.9 fm and the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm, and I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I multiplied by 1/k instead of k.

Wait, if I compute sum * k instead of sum * (1/k).

Sum is 9.1023, k≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

9.1023 *0.2535 → ≈2.31 fm.

No, that's not matching.

Hmm.

Well, I think the correct calculation is 35.9 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. But I can't figure it out. Maybe the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, but I don't know why.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(\cos\theta),
\]

where \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts, \( P_l(\cos\theta) \) are the Legendre polynomials, and \( k \) is the wave number. For the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)), \( P_l(\cos\theta) = P_l(1) = 1 \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is then given by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l \)
The given phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). Using these:

- For \( l=0 \): \( (2l+1) = 1 \), \( \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).
- For \( l=1 \): \( (2l+1) = 3 \), \( \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.8473 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419 \).
- For \( l=2 \): \( (2l+1) = 5 \), \( \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.6710 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355 \).
- For \( l=3 \): \( (2l+1) = 7 \), \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \).
- For \( l=4 \): \( (2l+1) = 9 \), \( \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.0506 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / \hbar \). For an electron with energy \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), the relativistic relation \( E = pc \) gives \( p = E/c \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), we find:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.2535 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, \( 1/k \approx 3.947 \, \text{fm} \).

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = 9.1023 \cdot 3.947 \approx 35.92 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated result of \( 35.92 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \( B \) (\( 355.351 \, \text{fm} \)) is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation, such as a missing factor of 10 in the sum or an incorrect interpretation of the phase shifts. Given the available options, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**
