Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are 9, 40, 63, and 16. I think β refers to the formation constant for each complex.

Wait, I remember that the stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily. For each complex, the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+, right? Let me list them. I think the complexes are:

- Co²+ (the free ion)
- Co(SCN)²+ (β1)
- Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2)
- Co(SCN)₃²+ (β3)
- Co(SCN)₄²− (β4? Wait, no, because β4 is 16. Hmm, maybe I got the order wrong.)

Wait, maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)n, where n is the number of SCN- attached. So:

n=0: Co²+ (β is 1, I think, since β1 is the first step)
n=1: Co(SCN)²+ (β1 =9)
n=2: Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2=40)
n=3: Co(SCN)₃²+ (β3=63)
n=4: Co(SCN)₄⁻? Because β4 is 16. Wait, the charge would change. Hmm, but I might not need to worry about that right now.

The problem is asking specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions attached. So that's the n=2 complex, Co(SCN)₂²+.

But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I think the blue one is the tetrahedral one, but I'm not 100% sure. Oh well, maybe that's the [Co(SCN)₄]^2−? No, wait, because dithiocyanato is two. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ions, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the dithiocyanato is the n=2 complex, and the tetrahedral is another. Well, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which I believe means two SCN- ligands. So the complex we're looking for is the n=2 one, Co(SCN)₂²+.

So, the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species.

I think I need to compute the distribution of each species and then find the fraction for n=2.

The general approach is to use the stability constants and the concentrations to find the fraction of each complex.

But how do I do that with multiple complexes? I remember that for a series of complexes, the fraction of each species can be determined using the stepwise formation constants and the overall concentrations.

The formula for the fraction of each species in the complexation series is given by the product of the stability constants divided by the sum of all such products up to that species.

Wait, but the stepwise constants are given as β1, β2, etc., which are the constants for each step. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that n.

Wait, no. Wait, the stepwise constants are the formation constants for each additional ligand. So for each step, the constant is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex.

So for the first complex, β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+ from Co²+ and SCN-.

The second step is β2 for Co(SCN)₂²+ from Co(SCN)²+ and another SCN-.

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)₂²+ would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for Co(SCN)₃²+, it's β1 * β2 * β3, and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The stepwise formation constants are β1, β2, etc. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn. For example:

- For n=1: K1 = β1
- For n=2: K2 = β1 * β2
- For n=3: K3 = β1 * β2 * β3
- For n=4: K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4

But wait, the problem gives four β values, so the highest complex is n=4, which would be Co(SCN)₄^2- (since each SCN- is -, and 4 of them would be -4, but the Co²+ gives +2, so overall charge would be -2. So, [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but then the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). So the trend is β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the first three steps have increasing β, making more stable complexes, and then β4 is lower.

Hmm, that might mean that the highest fraction is at n=3.

But regardless, the problem is about the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

So the approach is as follows:

1. Calculate the overall formation constants for each complex up to n=4.
2. Compute the fraction of each complex using these formation constants and the ligand concentration, along with the initial metal ion concentration.

The formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (K_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n) / (Σ (K_m * [Co] * [SCN]^m) for m=0 to 4 )

Wait, no, because each K_m is the product up to β1 to βm. Also, note that the free ion is n=0, which has K_0 = 1 (since no complexation has occurred).

Wait, the general expression for the fraction of each species (M, ML, ML2, etc.) is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [M][L]^n) / (sum for all possible n of (β1...βn [M][L]^n) )

But in this case, [M] is the concentration of Co²+ which is 1e-2 M, and [L] is [SCN-] which is 0.1 M.

Wait, but no, because each complexation step adds a ligand. So the expression for each species is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point multiplied by [M][L]^n, divided by the sum over all possible n.

Wait, actually, another approach is to use the cumulative formation constants. The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (K_n [M][L]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^{max_n} K_m [M][L]^m )

Where K_0 = 1, K_1 = β1, K_2 = β1β2, K_3 = β1β2β3, K_4 = β1β2β3β4.

But wait, the maximum n here is 4, but I'm not sure if the complexes go beyond that. But the problem gives four β's, so perhaps n=4 is the highest.

So let me compute K for each n from 0 to 4.

K_0 = 1
K_1 = β1 = 9
K_2 = β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360
K_3 = β1 * β2 * β3 = 9 *40*63 = let's see, 9*40 is 360, 360*63=22680
K_4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 = 22680 *16 = 362880

Wait, that's a lot. Let me compute each step:

Compute K_0 = 1 (n=0, free Co²+)
K_1 = β1 =9 (n=1)
K_2=β1*β2=9*40=360 (n=2)
K_3=360 *63 =22680 (n=3)
K_4=22680 *16=362880 (n=4)

So now, I need to calculate for each n, the term K_n * [Co][SCN]^n.

Wait, [Co] is 1e-2 M, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So for each n, the term is:

Term_n = K_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n

Let me compute each term:

n=0: Term0 = K0 * [Co] * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1e-2 * 1 = 0.01

n=1: Term1 = 9 * 1e-2 * (0.1)^1 = 9 * 1e-2 * 0.1 = 9 * 1e-3 = 0.009

n=2: Term2 = 360 * 1e-2 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 1e-2 * 0.01 = 360 * 1e-4 = 0.036

n=3: Term3= 22680 * 1e-2 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 1e-2 * 0.001 = 22680 * 1e-5 = 0.2268

n=4: Term4 = 362880 * 1e-2 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 1e-2 * 0.0001 = 362880 * 1e-6 = 0.36288

Wait, let me calculate these again more carefully.

n=0:
Term0 = K0 * [Co] * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1e-2 * 1 = 0.01 → 0.01

n=1:
Term1 = 9 * 1e-2 * (0.1) → 9 * 1e-3 → 0.009

n=2:
360 *1e-2 * (0.1)^2 → 360 * 1e-2 * 0.01 → 360 *1e-4 → 0.036

n=3:
22680 *1e-2 * (0.1)^3 → 22680 *1e-2 * 0.001 → 22680 * 1e-5 → 0.2268

n=4:
362880 *1e-2 * (0.1)^4 → 362880 *1e-2 * 0.0001 → 362880 *1e-6 → 0.36288

So now, sum all these terms.

Sum = 0.01 + 0.009 + 0.036 + 0.2268 + 0.36288.

Let me add them step by step.

0.01 + 0.009 = 0.019

0.019 + 0.036 = 0.055

0.055 + 0.2268 = 0.2818

0.2818 + 0.36288 = 0.64468

So the sum is 0.64468.

Now, the fraction for n=2 (dithiocyanato complex) is Term2 / Sum → 0.036 / 0.64468.

Compute that: 0.036 ÷ 0.64468 ≈ Let's see.

0.036 / 0.64468 ≈

Let me compute 0.036 ÷ 0.64468.

Well, 0.64468 is approximately 0.645.

0.036 ÷ 0.645 ≈ 0.0556, which is 5.56%.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.036 / 0.64468 = ?

Let me compute 0.036 ÷ 0.64468.

I can write this as approximately 36 / 644.68.

Dividing 36 by 644.68 ≈ 0.05557.

So approximately 5.56%.

Wait, that's about 5.5% of n=2. But looking at the options, the options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc. So I'm way off.

Wait, did I compute something wrong?

Wait, maybe I messed up the K_n for each n.

Wait, let me recheck the K_n:

K_0 = 1

K_1 = β1 =9

K_2 = β1 β2 =9 *40=360

K_3=360 *63=22680

K_4=22680 *16=362880

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm, but then the terms are as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but in the term, I have [Co][SCN]^n, but perhaps the [Co] is the same as the initial concentration before complexation, which is 1e-2 M. But when complexes form, the free Co²+ is less. Wait, wait a second. Oh no, perhaps I'm treating [Co] as the initial concentration, but in reality, [Co] in the expression is the free [Co²+] in solution. But when calculating the distribution, the total concentration is the sum of all species, so perhaps the approach is to use the total concentration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The correct approach is to consider the formation of all possible complexes, and the fraction of each is determined by their relative formation constants and the ligand concentrations.

Another approach might be to compute the mole fraction of each species. The mole fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [M][L]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 (β1...βm [M][L]^m) )

Which is what I did, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, but in my calculation, the sum was 0.64468, and the term for n=2 was 0.036.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recalculate each term.

Term0: 1 * 1e-2 * (0.1)^0 = 1e-2 = 0.01

Term1: 9 * 1e-2 * 0.1 = 9 *1e-3=0.009

Term2: 360 *1e-2 * (0.1)^2 =360 *1e-2 *0.01 =360 *1e-4=0.036

Term3:22680 *1e-2 * (0.1)^3 =22680 *1e-2 *0.001= 22680 *1e-5=0.2268

Term4:362880 *1e-2 * (0.1)^4 =362880 *1e-2 *0.0001 =362880 *1e-6=0.36288

Sum: 0.01 +0.009=0.019; +0.036=0.055; +0.2268=0.2818; +0.36288=0.64468 → correct.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.036 / 0.64468 ≈ 0.0556, which is ~5.56%, but that's not any of the options provided.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the K values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe the β values are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^{n+} where n is different.

Wait, another possibility is that the β values are given for the successive formation of complexes, but perhaps the initial β1 is for Co(SCN)²+, β2 is for Co(SCN)₂²+, β3 for Co(SCN)₃^+, etc. Or perhaps the β4 is for the Co(SCN)₄^2−, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the given β values are for the overall complexes, not stepwise. No, I thought they were stepwise, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are for the overall complexes:

β1 = log K1 =9 → K1=1e9.

Wait no, because the problem says 'stability constants', which are usually given as K, not log K. So β is K, not log K.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the stepwise constants as K1, K2, etc. Maybe the given β values are for the overall constants. Let me think: if β1 is the overall K for [Co(SCN)]²+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+, etc., then the calculation would be different.

Wait, but the given βs are 9,40,63,16. If these are the Ks for each complex, then:

K1=9 → [Co(SCN)]²+/Co²+ SCN- =9.

K2=40 → [Co(SCN)₂²+]/([Co(SCN)]²+ SCN-) =40.

Then the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂²+] would be K1 * K2 =9*40=360, as I did before.

So I think my initial approach was correct.

Hmm, but why am I getting a fraction of about 5.5% for n=2, which doesn't match any options. The options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents of [SCN].

Wait, for n=2, [SCN]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

But wait, [SCN] is 0.1 M, correct. So each term is correct.

Wait, maybe I have to include the charge in the calculation? No, stability constants are unitless; they include the charges in their calculation. So I shouldn't need to adjust for that.

Wait, maybe I forgot to consider that the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of all previous βs.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fractions are calculated using the logarithm of the constants, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentrations of each complex, including the free ion, and then find the percentage.

Let me think again: the fractions are the mole fractions of each species. The sum of all fractions should be 1.

But according to my current calculation, the fractions sum to 1, but the term for n=2 is 5.5%, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the stability constants. Let me think: perhaps the β given are for the different complexes, not stepwise. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]²+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]²+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But then, the overall K for each complex is just β1, β2, etc. So for n=1, K1=9, n=2 K2=40, n=3 K3=63, n=4 K4=16.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

Let me recalculate using this approach. Because perhaps I was multiplying them when I shouldn't have.

If βn is the overall K for the nth complex, then:

The term for each n would be K_n [Co][SCN]^n / sum.

So, K0=1, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

So let's compute the terms again.

n=0: 1 *1e-2 * (0.1)^0= 0.01

n=1:9 *1e-2 *0.1=9e-3=0.009

n=2:40 *1e-2 *0.01=40e-4=0.004

n=3:63 *1e-2 *0.001=63e-5=0.00063

n=4:16 *1e-2 *0.0001=16e-6=0.000016

Sum: 0.01 +0.009=0.019; +0.004=0.023; +0.00063=0.02363; +0.000016=0.023646.

So sum is about 0.023646.

Then the fraction for n=2 is 0.004 / 0.023646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So that would make the answer D.

But wait, why did I get a different answer when I interpreted the βs as stepwise versus as overall constants?

Ah, because the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.'

Stability constants (β) are generally the overall formation constants for the complex, not the stepwise.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)]²+ is K1=β1=9.

The stability constant for [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is K2=β2=40. Wait, but how is that possible? Because the second complex would have a higher K than the first if they're more stable.

Wait, no, the stepwise formation constant for the second ligand is K2'= [Co(SCN)₂²+]/([Co(SCN)]²+ [SCN^-]).

Similarly, the overall formation constant K2 for [Co(SCN)₂²+] is K1 * K2' =9 *40=360.

So, in that case, the initial approach (with stepwise βs) was correct, leading to the 5.5% which is not an option.

But when I take the given βs as the overall Ks for each complex (which may not be correct), the calculation leads to 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, that seems conflicting. Which is the correct approach?

I think the confusion arises from the terminology. The 'stability constant' βn is generally the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, for [Co(SCN)]²+, β1=9. For [Co(SCN)₂]²+, β2=40, which would be the formation constant K2=40.

Wait, but that can't be right because the stepwise formation constant for the second ligand would be β2 = K2/K1 =40/9 ≈4.444.

Hmm, that makes sense. Because the stepwise constant is the ratio of adding one more ligand.

So, in that case, the given βs are the overall Ks, not the stepwise.

Thus, the correct approach is to use βn as the overall K for each complex. So, for each n, K_n = βn.

Thus, the terms would be:

Term0 = 1 *1e-2 * (0.1)^0 = 0.01

Term1 =9 *1e-2 *0.1=0.009

Term2=40 *1e-2 *0.01=0.004

Term3=63 *1e-2 *0.001=0.00063

Term4=16 *1e-2 *0.0001=0.000016

Sum is 0.01 +0.009 +0.004 +0.00063 +0.000016 = 0.023646.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 0.004 / 0.023646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%, option D.

But wait, why does the problem mention the stability constants as 'β1=9, β2=40, etc.'? Stability constants are cumulative; each βn is the overall K for the nth complex. So, my second approach must be correct, leading to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16), the cobalt concentration [Co] = 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants provided are interpreted as the overall formation constants for each complex.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction Calculation**: The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{K_n \cdot [\text{Co}] \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^{4} K_m \cdot [\text{Co}] \cdot [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]
   where \(K_n = \beta_n\) for the nth complex.

2. **Terms for Each Complex**:
   - \(K_0 = 1\) (free Co²⁺):  
     \[
     \text{Term}_0 = K_0 \cdot [\text{Co}] \cdot [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot 1 = 0.01
     \]
   - \(K_1 = \beta_1 = 9\) ([Co(SCN)]²⁺):  
     \[
     \text{Term}_1 = 9 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot 0.1 = 0.009
     \]
   - \(K_2 = \beta_2 = 40\) ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺):  
     \[
     \text{Term}_2 = 40 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot 0.01 = 0.004
     \]
   - \(K_3 = \beta_3 = 63\) ([Co(SCN)₃]²⁺):  
     \[
     \text{Term}_3 = 63 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot 0.001 = 0.00063
     \]
   - \(K_4 = \beta_4 = 16\) ([Co(SCN)₄]²⁻):  
     \[
     \text{Term}_4 = 16 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot 0.0001 = 0.000016
     \]

3. **Sum of All Terms**:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \text{Term}_0 + \text{Term}_1 + \text{Term}_2 + \text{Term}_3 + \text{Term}_4 = 0.01 + 0.009 + 0.004 + 0.00063 + 0.000016 = 0.023646
   \]

4. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺)**:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.004}{0.023646} \approx 0.169
   \]

5. **Percentage**:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
