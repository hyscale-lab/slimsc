Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, wait—the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait. Magnitudes are a bit confusing. Wait, lower numbers are brighter. So if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Oh wait, no, maybe I got that reversed. Wait, the more negative or lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So, if a star is brighter than 17, that means its magnitude is less than 17. Because a magnitude of 1 is brighter than 6. Got it.

So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17. Because it can detect those brighter than 17, so m_V <17? Or is it including 17? The question says "brighter than 17 mag"—so I think it's m <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so m <16.

So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no. Wait, the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So m <17. For HIRES, m <16.

Therefore, a star that can be detected by both must have m <16.

Wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 16, then it's m <16. So both telescopes can pick it up. But if it's between 16 and 17, then it's only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So the star must have m <16 to be detected by both instruments.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust reddening), if applicable.

Wait, each star's description: some have absolute magnitude and distance, others have apparent magnitude already. So let's go through each star.

Star1: absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc.

Apparent magnitude m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) ?

Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10), where d is in parsecs.

So for Star1: d=10 pc.

m = 15.5 +5*log(10/10) = 15.5 +5*0 =15.5.

So m=15.5. That's less than 16. So HIRES can detect it (since m <16), and ESPRESSO can too (since m <17). So Star1 is observable by both.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5 mag, distance is 5 pc. Wait, wait, no. Wait, Star2's description says apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=16.5.

So for HIRES, which can detect m <16, 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't see it. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO (since m=16.5 <17), but not HIRES. So Star2 can't be in the answer.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5 mag, but E(B-V)=0.6. So we need to correct for extinction.

Wait, the question says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

Apparent magnitude is m_observed. The intrinsic (without extinction) magnitude would be m0 = m_observed - Av.

Wait, wait, no. Because extinction makes the star appear fainter. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

Because if the star is behind dust, more light is absorbed, so the apparent magnitude is higher (more positive, meaning fainter). So m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

So to get the intrinsic m_intrinsic, m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av.

So for Star3, m_observed is 15.5, Av is 1.86. So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

Wait, but wait. No, wait, that can't be right. Because if the observed magnitude is m, then the extinction makes it look brighter? No, wait, no. No, I think I got it wrong.

Wait, if there's dust, the star appears dimmer. So the apparent magnitude is higher (since higher means fainter). So when you correct for extinction, the m_intrinsic is m_observed - Av.

Wait, let me think. The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

So m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av.

So for Star3: m_observed is 15.5. Av is 1.86. So m_intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 13.64, which is brighter than 16. So both instruments can detect it.

Wait, but wait—no. Because the m_observed is 15.5, which is the apparent magnitude as seen through the dust. So the actual flux is dimmer. Or is the question referring to the apparent magnitude after correcting for extinction?

Hmm, I think I need to clarify whether the given apparent magnitude in Star3 is the observed (including extinction) or the intrinsic.

The question says, for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..."

So the apparent magnitude is observed (including extinction). Because E(B-V) is the color excess, so the star's light is reddened and dimmed. So the apparent magnitude (m) given is the observed one, which includes extinction.

So in that case, to find the intrinsic apparent magnitude, we need to subtract Av.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star's light is absorbed, so it's dimmer. So when you observe it, the apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than it would be without extinction.

So the observed m is m = m0 (intrinsic) + Av.

So to find m0, m0 = m - Av.

So m_observed =15.5. Av=1.86.

m0=15.5 -1.86=13.64.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 13.64, which is brighter. But wait, why does that matter? Because for the instruments, they observe the m including the extinction. So if the instrument can detect up to m=16 or 17, we have to consider the observed m.

Wait, no. The instrument's limit is based on the apparent magnitude as observed. Because that's what determines how much light they receive.

So for Star3: m_observed is 15.5.

So, for HIRES, which can go down to m <16, 15.5 is acceptable. So HIRES can detect it.

ESPRESSO can go to m <17, so 15.5 is also acceptable. Thus, Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait a minute. Star3's m_observed is 15.5. So both can detect it.

But wait, what about Star4?

Star4: absolute V mag of 15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

So first, calculate apparent mag without extinction.

Using m = M +5 log10(d/10) → M=15.5, d=10.

So m =15.5 + 5*log(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5.

But extinction: Av=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So the observed m is m_obs = m + Av? No, wait: m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, no. The formula is: m_obs = m_true + Av.

Because the extinction makes the star appear fainter, so higher m.

So m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the intrinsic m is 15.5, and extinction adds 1.24, then m_obs is 16.74.

Wait, but then Star4's observed m is 16.74 mag.

So for HIRES, which can detect m <16. So 16.74 is too faint. So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can detect m up to 17. So 16.74 <17, so ESPRESSO can detect it.

Wait, but wait. So Star4's observed m is 16.74. So it's only visible by ESPRESSO.

So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Star4's M is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m =15.5 +5*(log10(10) -1)=15.5 +5*(1-1)=15.5. So m is 15.5 without extinction. Then, extinction adds Av=1.24 to m, so m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the observed m is 16.74. So is that correct? Because extinction makes it appear fainter.

Yes, because the star is behind dust, so we see it as dimmer. So yes, m increases.

So HIRES requires m <16. 16.74 is above 16, so HIRES can't detect. But ESPRESSO can, as 16.74 <17. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

So Star4 is out.

Star5: absolute V mag of 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute m = M +5 log10(d/10).

d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.3010.

So m =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0 mag.

So apparent magnitude is about 15.0.

So m_obs=15.0.

So for HIRES, m <16 → 15.0 is good. So HIRES can detect it.

ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so yes.

So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, any extinction? The description for Star5 doesn't mention E(B-V), so no extinction.

So Star5's m is 15.0. So both can detect.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 has m=16.5, which is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Star1: m=15.5. So both can detect it.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

But looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, let's recheck Star3.

Star3: m_obs=15.5. So both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can.

So which option includes both of these?

Looking at options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. So both can be detected.

Wait, but the answer options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, so the correct pair is Star3 and Star5? Or is there another possibility?

Wait, wait. Star1: m=15.5. So it can be detected by both.

Star3: m_obs=15.5.

Star5: m=15.0.

So which of the options includes Star3 and Star5?

Option B is 'Star3 and Star5'. So yes.

Wait, but wait. Let me check Star1.

Star1: m=15.5. So observable by HIRES since 15.5 <16, and by ESPRESSO (15.5 <17). So Star1 can be detected by both.

So which other stars can be detected by both?

Star3 (m_obs=15.5), Star5 (15.0), and Star1 (15.5).

So Star1, Star3, Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but the options don't have any option that includes Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Looking at each option:

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Star1 can be observed by both. Star4 can't, as m_obs=16.74, which is beyond HIRES's limit.

So option D is out.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be observed by both.

Option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Star5 is m=15.0, which is okay for both.

Star3 has m_obs=15.5, which is okay for both.

So the pair is Star3 and Star5.

But let me double-check.

Let me list all stars and their m_obs:

Star1: m=15.5 → both detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 (after correcting for extinction) → both detect.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0 → both detect.

So the question is: which stars can be detected by both.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 no.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) satisfies \( m < 17 \) (ESPRESSO) and \( m < 16 \) (HIRES).  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \) exceeds \( m < 16 \) (HIRES), so it cannot be detected by HIRES.  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - Intrinsic apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = m_{\text{obs}} - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64
     \]  
   - The observed magnitude \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 \) satisfies \( m < 17 \) (ESPRESSO) and \( m < 16 \) (HIRES).  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 \) exceeds \( m < 16 \) (HIRES), so it cannot be detected by HIRES.  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \), Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \) satisfies \( m < 17 \) (ESPRESSO) and \( m < 16 \) (HIRES).  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.
