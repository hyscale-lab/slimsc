Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, they only found them between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region, I think.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) -0.5i. Wait, is that a complex function? Because of the 'i' term. Oh, right, i is the imaginary unit. But in quantum mechanics, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So I guess the imaginary part affects the probability distribution.

But the problem states that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero (or zero probability) outside that interval. So the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the function given is correct only in that region, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, or is it (a divided by sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i? So the wave function is a complex number with a real part a/sqrt(1+x) and an imaginary part -0.5.

But wait, if the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, then for x <1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero. That would mean that the real part and the imaginary part are zero in those regions.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for x <1, sqrt(1+x) is real and positive. So a/sqrt(1+x) is real. So the wave function would have a real part a/sqrt(1+x) and an imaginary part -0.5. But if the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3, then in x <1 and x>3, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero.

But wait, the real part can't be zero unless a/sqrt(1+x) is zero. But that would only happen if a is zero, which would make the whole wave function zero except for the imaginary part. But wait, the imaginary part is -0.5i, which is a constant. So that can't be zero except if 0.5 is zero, which it isn't.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So perhaps the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the way the question is phrased, it says the wave function in a part of space where the particle can exist is described by that function. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid for x between 1 and 3, and zero outside. That would make sense because the measurements show the particles are only found between 1 and 3.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. But if it's zero outside of x=1 to x=3, then the expression must be zero in those regions. So for x <1, sqrt(1+x) is sqrt( a number less than 2 ), but then the a/sqrt(1+x) would be a real number. But the imaginary part is -0.5i, which doesn't become zero. So that would mean the wave function is non-zero outside x=1 to x=3, which contradicts the measurement.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wave function. Wait, perhaps the wave function is given as a real function in a part of space, and the imaginary part is zero. Or perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) * e^{-i something}, but that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) plus some imaginary term. But in any case, if the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that region, so maybe the given expression is valid only in that interval, and zero otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) multiplied by a function that is 1 between x=1 and x=3 and 0 outside. But the question states that the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) -0.5i in the region where it can exist. So maybe the particle's wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but then the integral of the probability density over all space must be 1. So the probability density is the absolute square of the wave function. So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5, so when you square the absolute value, it's (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but that would give us an equation to solve for 'a'. Let me write that down.

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So let's compute that integral. Let me split it into two parts:

Integral (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3, plus Integral (0.25) dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: a² * ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).

So evaluating from 1 to3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps.

The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5, so their squares are a²/(1+x) and 0.25, respectively. So the probability density is [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

But wait a minute, no. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i). So the absolute square is |ψ|^2 = [Re(ψ)]^2 + [Im(ψ)]^2. So yes, (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25).

So the integral from 1 to3 of this expression equals 1.

I think I did that correctly.

So let me compute a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Wait, wait no, because the integral of a^2/(1+x) is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2). So yes, the first term is a² ln(2), and the second term is 0.5*(3-1)=0.5*2=1? Wait, no. Wait, 0.25 * (3-1) is 0.5, right.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a = sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the integral. Let me recheck.

Wait, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) from x=1 to 3 is a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to3, which is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Correct.

The integral of 0.25 from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) =0.5. Correct.

So 0.5 + a² ln(2) =1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931≈0.7213 → a≈0.849.

Looking at the options, the closest is B) 0.85.

But wait another thing: in quantum mechanics, wave functions must be normalizable, so the integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1. So I think the steps are correct.

Wait, but the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So perhaps I should model the wave function as ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] e^{-iθ}, where θ is such that the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps the full wave function has that form between 1 and3, and zero elsewhere.

But if that's the case, then the wave function would have non-zero imaginary parts outside of where it's supposed to be. Wait no, because outside x=1 to3, the wave function is zero, so the entire expression would be zero, including the imaginary part. So perhaps the wave function is being modeled as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i only between x=1 and3, and zero elsewhere.

Hmm, but if that's the case, then the wave function would have parts outside x=1 to3, but that's not compatible with the measurements. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between 1 and3, and zero elsewhere. So maybe the entire wave function is written as ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1≤x≤3, and zero otherwise.

In that case, the normalization integral is from 1 to3.

Wait, but then the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to3 is 1, and zero elsewhere, so the normalization is correct.

So, okay, I think my initial calculation is correct. So a is approximately 0.85, so option B is the answer.

The problem involves determining the normalization constant \( a \) for a wave function describing a particle confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. The particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), meaning the wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires that the total probability, represented by the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), equals 1:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
   - The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \).
   - Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
     \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \)
   - The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is:
     \[
     0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
     \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( a = 0.85 \).

**Answer: B**
