Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—1.5 times each. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength λ is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars emit most strongly at the same wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. That makes sense because the problem states that the wavelengths are the same.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right! Because the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So according to Wien's Law, that implies that both stars have the same temperature. Because λ_max is the same → T is the same for both stars.

So T1 = T2. Got it.

Now, the next part is about luminosity. I recall that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a perfect black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same temperature, the T⁴ term is the same for both. So the luminosity depends only on R². But wait, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴. Similarly, L2 = 4π R2² σ T⁴. So the ratio L1/L2 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would point towards option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the problem?

Oh! Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, its light experiences a Doppler shift. The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So does that mean that the Doppler shift must have adjusted for the intrinsic differences?

Wait, no. Because the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same, but the intrinsic λ_max (before considering Doppler) might be different.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted. So the observed wavelength would be shorter than its intrinsic wavelength. Conversely, if Star_1 has no radial velocity, its observed wavelength is the same as its intrinsic.

So, let's model this.

Let me denote the intrinsic (rest) λ_max for Star_1 as λ1, and for Star_2 as λ2. But according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both is the same. Let's call this observed wavelength λ_obs.

Since Star_1 has no radial velocity, its observed λ_obs is just λ1.

Star_2 is moving towards us at velocity v=700 km/s. So its observed wavelength λ_obs is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula. But wait, for non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate the Doppler shift. The formula is:

λ_obs ≈ λ2 * (1 - v / c )

Wait, no, actually, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) ), where β = v/c.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me recall. The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Alternatively, for recessional velocity, the formula is different, but since Star_2 has a positive radial velocity (700 km/s), it's moving away, which would cause a redshift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, radial velocity can be positive or negative. If the star is moving towards us, the radial velocity is negative (because it's blueshifted), and moving away is positive (redshift).

Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1's velocity is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s. But wait, is 700 km/s towards or away from us? Oh, the problem states radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s—so radial velocity is positive when moving away. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s, which would cause a redshift in its light.

But the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So let's model this.

For Star_1: since it's not moving, λ_obs,1 = λ1.

For Star_2: it's moving away at 700 km/s, so the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So λ_obs,2 = λ2 * (1 + v/c) approximately, assuming v << c (non-relativistic approximation).

Wait, but wait. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c). Similarly, when moving towards, it's λ_obs = λ_source * (1 - v/c). Since Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So, λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c )

Wait, but wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Because Star_1 is at rest, λ1 is its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is λ2, but because it's moving away, the observed λ2_obs is λ2 * (1 + v/c). But according to the problem, λ1 = λ2_obs.

So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c )

But from earlier (Wien's Law), we thought that T1 = T2, because λ1 = λ2. But now, taking Doppler into account, the intrinsic λ's may be different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Both stars have the same observed λ_max (λ_obs), so λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 = λ.

2. For Star_1: no velocity, so λ_obs,1 = λ1.

3. For Star_2: moving away at v=700 km/s. So λ_obs,2 = λ2 * (1 + v/(c)).

Setting them equal:

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c)

But from Wien's Law, the intrinsic λ is inversely proportional to temperature: λ = b / T.

So λ1 = b / T1, and λ2 = b / T2.

So substituting into the equation:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c )

Rearranging:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1, because it's moving away. Wait, but wait, that's from the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength is same, but their intrinsic temperatures are different.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that T1 = T2 because λ1 = λ2. But that's without considering the Doppler effect. So that's the mistake I made earlier.

So, the correct approach is to account for the Doppler shift.

So going back to the problem, the observed λ_max for both is the same. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 = λ.

But for Star_1, λ_obs = λ1. For Star_2, λ_obs = λ2 * (1 + v/c ), since it's moving away. So λ1 = λ2 (1 + v/c )

But λ is also related to temperature via Wien's law: λ = b / T.

So for Star_1: λ1 = b / T1

For Star_2: λ2 = b / T2

Substituting into the equation λ1 = λ2 (1 + v/c ), we get:

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v/c )

Then,

T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So T2 is bigger than T1 because v is positive.

Wait, but the problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So, their luminosities depend on R² T^4.

So, L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4

We need to find L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Substitute R1 = 1.5 R2:

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= (1.5^2) (R2^2) T1^4 / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= 2.25 ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

But from earlier, T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

Wait, no, let me write it as:

T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c )

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c )^4

Putting this back into L1/L2:

= 2.25 * [ 1 / (1 + v/c )^4 ]

Wait, no, wait. Because T1^4 / T2^4 is (T1/T2)^4.

So,

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * [ (T1/T2) ]^4

We have T2 = T1*(1 + v/c ), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c )

So,

= 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c )]^4

= 2.25 / (1 + v/c )^4

Now, v is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v/c ), but since v is 700 km/s and c is about 3e5 km/s (300,000 km/s), v is much smaller than c. So (v/c) is 700 / 3e5 = approximately 0.002333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

But let's compute it accurately. 700 / 300000 = 0.002333333.

So, 1 + v/c = 1.002333333.

So, (1 + v/c )^4 ≈ (1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute that. Let's approximate (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx when x is small. But since x is 0.002333, it's small but maybe we should compute more accurately.

But let's compute (1.0023333)^4.

Compute step by step:

1.0023333^2 = ?

First, compute 1.0023333 * 1.0023333.

Approximate:

= (1 + 0.0023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2

= 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.000005444

≈ 1.004672044.

Now, square that: (1.004672044)^2.

Again, using approximation:

= (1 + 0.004672044)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.004672044 + (0.004672044)^2

= 1 + 0.009344088 + 0.000021827

≈ 1.009365915.

So, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659.

So, (1 + v/c )^4 ≈ 1.009366.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 divided by 1.009366.

Hmm, 2.25 / 1.009366.

Let me approximate this division.

1.009366 is approximately 1.009366.

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.009366.

We can write this as 2.25 * (1/1.009366).

Approximate 1/1.009366 ≈ 0.991 (since 1.009366 * 0.991 ≈ 1).

Wait, let's see: 1.009366 * 0.991 ≈ ?

1.009366 * 0.991 = (1.009366)*(1 - 0.009) ≈ 1.009366 - 0.009084 ≈ 1.000282.

Close to 1, but a bit over. So perhaps 0.991 is a slight underestimate.

Alternatively, let's compute 1/1.009366.

Since 1.009366 = 1 + 0.009366.

Using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ..., for small x.

So, 1/1.009366 = 1/(1 + 0.009366) ≈ 1 - 0.009366 + (0.009366)^2 - (0.009366)^3 + ...

Calculate up to the second term:

≈ 1 - 0.009366 = 0.990634.

Plus the square of 0.009366 is about 0.0000877, so third term is positive.

So, 0.990634 + 0.0000877 ≈ 0.9907217.

So, 1/1.009366 ≈ ~0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But more accurately:

2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.25 * (0.99 + 0.0007) = 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Doppler shift would cause the observed λ to be longer for Star_2, but the problem says both have same observed λ, which led us to the conclusion that T2 is higher than T1.

Hence, the luminosity is L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.009366) ≈ 2.229, which rounds to ~2.23, so option D.

Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Both stars have same observed λ_max. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

2. λ_obs,2 = λ2 * (1 + v/c ), since Star_2 is moving away.

3. So λ1 = λ2 (1 + v/c )

4. From Wien's law: λ = b / T → λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

5. Substituting: (b/T1) = (b/T2)(1 + v/c )

6. T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

7. Luminosity ratio: L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

8. R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1^2/R2^2 = 2.25.

9. T2 = T1 (1 + v/c ) → T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c )

10. So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1 + v/c )^4.

11. L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c )^4.

12. v = 700 km/s, c ≈3e5 km/s → v/c ≈ 0.002333.

13. (1 + v/c )^4 ≈ 1.009366.

14. 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.229, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and relevant physical laws.

### Key Information:
1. **Radius and Mass**: Star_1 has a radius and mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2.
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, implying their observed peak wavelengths are identical.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 moves away at 700 km/s.
4. **Blackbody Radiation**: The stars are assumed to radiate as blackbodies, so their luminosities depend on their radii and temperatures.

### Step 1: Relating Temperature and Wavelength
From Wien's Law, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]
where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars, we equate their intrinsic wavelengths adjusted for Doppler shift.

For Star_1 (no radial velocity):
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_1
\]
For Star_2 (moving away at \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_2 \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]
Equating the observed wavelengths:
\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]
Substituting Wien's Law (\( \lambda \propto 1/T \)) for both stars:
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]
Rearranging:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]
The ratio of luminosities is:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c) \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 (T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c))^4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 1.5^2 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_1^4 \cdot (1 + v/c)^4}
\]
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{(1 + v/c)^4}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( (1 + v/c)^4 \)
The speed of light \( c \approx 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so:
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]
\[
1 + v/c \approx 1.002333
\]
Using the binomial approximation for small \( x \):
\[
(1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx
\]
For \( n = 4 \) and \( x = 0.002333 \):
\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) = 1.009332
\]

### Step 4: Final Luminosity Ratio
Substitute \( (1 + v/c)^4 \approx 1.009332 \) into the luminosity ratio:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009332} \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Match to Options
The closest option to \( 2.229 \) is **D) ~2.23**.

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
