Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit, right? Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The question is about choosing which one to observe to maximize the chance of detecting a transit.

Hmm, let me break down the given information. Both planets have the same mass, so that's equal. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to the distance from the star. Kepler's third law comes into play here. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Oh, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same size.

So, the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is something like R_p / (R_s * a), where R_p is the planet's radius, R_s the star's radius, and a the semi-major axis of the orbit. Wait, no, I think it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. The probability is roughly (R_s + R_p)/a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_s / a) multiplied by some factor. Or wait, maybe it's proportional to R_s / a. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, let me think. The transit probability (P) is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So higher a (larger orbit) means lower probability. But wait, no, if a is the distance, then a larger a would make the transit less likely because the planet's path is a smaller fraction of the star's area.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. But in this case, R_planet is Earth-sized, so much smaller than star radius. So P ≈ R_star / (a * (1 + (M_planet/(M_star + M_planet))^(1/3))) ) ? No, wait, that's the formula for the semi-major axis from Kepler's law. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet’s orbit. The probability increases when the star is smaller (so R_star is smaller) and when the planet's orbital distance (a) is smaller. Wait, no, wait: if a is smaller (planet is closer), the orbital plane's orientation has a higher chance of passing in front. Because the planet's orbit is a smaller circle, so the chance that it aligns edge-on with our line of sight is higher when a is smaller.

Wait, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2? Or is it (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of orbits that are edge-on? I think the exact formula is P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but considering the planet's orbital distance, but R_p is negligible, so P ≈ R_*/a. But wait, I'm not so sure. Maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but in terms of how likely the planet's path crosses our line of sight.

Alternatively, another way to think: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a). So P is proportional to (R_* / a).

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's think about the formula. The probability of a transit is given by:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 + e² * sin²(ω/2)))^{1/2} )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and ω is the argument of periastron, which averages out. So for circular orbits, P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a) ), but again, R_planet is negligible, so P ≈ R_star / a.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor. But perhaps it's R_star/(a) multiplied by something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / M_planet)) )) ), but that's not quite right. Maybe that's the formula for the semi-major axis in terms of the radial velocity method.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The bigger this ratio (R_* / a), the higher the probability of transit, because a larger star relative to the orbital distance makes transiting more probable.

Wait, that makes sense. If a planet is very far from its star (large a), then the chance that its orbit's plane lines up with our line of sight is lower. So the probability of transit is higher when a is small and R_* is large.

In this problem, we have two planets. Let me compare Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Given that Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

We can find the ratio a1/a2 using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + m_planet)/(4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + m_planet ≈ M_star.

So a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star.

So for each planet:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (P1^2 * M1) / (P2^2 * M2)

Given that P1 = P2 / 3, so P1^2 = P2^2 / 9.

M1 is the mass of Planet_1's star, which is twice that of Planet_2's star, so M1 = 2 * M2.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = ( (P2^2/9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2^2 * M2 )

Simplify numerator: ( (P2^2)(2 M2) ) / 9

Denominator: P2^2 * M2

So a1^3/a2^3 = (2/9) => a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). 2 is approximately 2, 9 is 3^2. So cube root of (2/9) is cube root of (2)/(3^(2/3)).

Alternatively, 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, no—because a1^3 is (2/9) times a2^3. So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Cube root of 2 is ~1.26, cube root of 9 is ~2.08. So 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. So a1 = 0.6 * a2.

So a1 is shorter than a2.

Wait, that makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period and a more massive star. So the semi-major axis a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, transit probability P ∝ (R_star / a) for each planet.

But wait, both stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2.

So P1 = R1 / a1, P2 = R2 / a2.

Since R1 = R2, and a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So P1 = R / a1 ≈ R / (0.6 a2) ≈ (1/0.6) (R/a2) )= (5/3) (R/a2)

Similarly, P2 = R/a2.

So P1 is about 5/3 times P2, which is approximately 1.666 times P2.

Wait, that would mean that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, a1 is smaller than a2. Because P1 is shorter, and the star is more massive, so the planet is closer.

So R_star is same for both.

So higher a means lower transit probability.

Since a1 < a2, then R/a1 > R/a2. So P1 > P2.

So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but what about the mass of the star? Does that affect the semi-major axis? Because in Kepler's third law, a^3 ∝ (P^2 * M_star). So a is dependent on M_star and P.

But in our previous calculation, a1 is smaller than a2 because even though P1 is shorter, M1 is larger, so the a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, wait: let me re-calculate the a1/a2 ratio.

We have:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (P1^2 * M1) ] / [ (P2^2 * M2) ]

P1 = P2 /3.

M1= 2 M2.

So P1^2 = P2^2 /9.

So (P1^2 * M1) = (P2^2 /9) * 2 M2 = (2/9) P2^2 M2.

Divided by (P2^2 * M2) = P2^2 M2.

So (2/9 P2^2 M2) / (P2^2 M2) ) = 2/9.

Hence a1^3/a2^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = cube root (2/9) ≈ 0.6.

So a1≈0.6 a2.

So transit probabilities:

P1 = R / a1 = R/(0.6 a2) ≈ (1/0.6) (R/a2) ≈ 1.6667 * (R/a2).

P2 = R/a2.

So P1 ≈ 1.6667 * P2 → P1 is about 1.66 times higher than P2.

So the probability of transit is higher for Planet_1, so the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, 1.666 is approximately 1.65 or 1.67. So option C says 1.65 times.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is more precise.

Wait, let's compute the exact ratio.

a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2 ≈ 8e-1.58496, so wait, maybe logarithm approach.

ln(2/9) = ln(0.2222) ≈ -1.4916.

Divide by 3 → -0.4972.

Exponentiate → e^(-0.4972) ≈ 0.607.

So a1 = a2 * 0.607.

So a1 ≈ 0.607 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.607 a2) ≈ 1.646 (R/a2).

So approximately 1.65 times higher.

So option C is correct.

So the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period (\( P \)) and the mass of the host star (\( M_* \)) by:

\[
a^3 \propto P^2 \cdot M_*
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1's orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).
- Planet_1's host star mass is \( M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2} \).

Substituting into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{P_1^2 \cdot M_{*,1}}{P_2^2 \cdot M_{*,2}} = \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2 M_{*,2}}{P_2^2 \cdot M_{*,2}} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.607
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.607 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)):

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R_*}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R_*}{a_2}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.607 a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.607} \approx 1.646
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. The probability difference is not ~1.5 times.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **D)** Incorrect. The probability difference is not ~2.7 times.
