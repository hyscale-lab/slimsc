Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in a lab. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer? Or in the same direction as the beam? Let me re-read the question. Oh, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that can't be right. If the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer, that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Let me think. The beam is in the glass, and the glass is moving. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v, same direction as the beam. But the beam itself is in the glass, which has a refractive index n. So the speed of light in the glass when it's at rest is c/n, right? Because normally, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index.

But here, the glass is moving. So I think this is a problem involving relative velocities in different reference frames. Maybe I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just add velocities classically.

Wait, but wait. The speed of light in the glass in its rest frame is c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass's frame, what would be the speed of the light beam?

Let me think about frames. Let me consider the glass as a moving frame. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving with speed v in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, the beam is inside the glass, which is moving, so the beam's speed in the lab frame would be affected by both the medium's motion and the light's motion within the medium.

Wait, but when you have a moving medium, how does that affect the observed speed of light? I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n regardless of the medium's motion. But wait, that's in the medium's own rest frame. When the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed of light?

Wait, no. Because according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is c in all inertial frames. But when the medium is moving, it's a different situation. In a medium at rest, the speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect it?

Wait, but in this problem, the light is in the glass, which is moving. So perhaps we can model this using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me think. Let's denote u' as the speed of light in the glass's rest frame. So u' = c/n.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So we need to find the speed u of the light in the lab frame.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c² ]

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. So when the glass is moving, the lab sees the light's speed as u = [u' + v]/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

But wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n, right? So substituting that in:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplifying the denominator:

Denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that. Let's write the denominator as [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ] = (n c + v) / (n c) ) = [ (n c + v ) ] / (n c )

So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ (n c ) / (n c + v ) ]

The n in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the denominator in the second fraction. So:

u = [ (c + n v) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me recheck.

Wait, no, the first term is (c + n v)/n, so it's (c + n v) divided by n. The second term is [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ].

So when you multiply (c + n v)/n by (n c)/(n c + v), the n cancels. So:

u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

So,

u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm, but let me plug in some numbers to see if this makes sense. For example, if n is 1 (like a vacuum), then the speed of light in the medium is c. So substituting n=1, u = c (c + v) / (c + v) )= c.

Which is correct, because in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c regardless of the frame's movement. So that checks out.

Another test: If v is zero, the glass is stationary. Then u = c (c + 0 )/( 0 + c ) = c² / c = c. Wait, that can't be right because in the glass, the speed should be c/n. Wait, wait, what's wrong here.

Wait, no, wait. When v=0, the glass is stationary in the lab frame. So the light's speed in the lab is c/n, right? But according to this formula, when v=0, u = c (c + 0 ) / (0 + c ) ) = c² / c = c. That's incorrect because in the glass, it should be c/n.

So I must have made a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula.

Wait, perhaps I reversed the frames. In the glass frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. So when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (the lab sees the glass moving at v), then the lab should calculate u as (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But when v=0, u should be c/n. Plugging into the equation:

u = (c/n + 0) / (1 + 0 ) = c/n. That works. Earlier I thought I had u = c, which was wrong, but that was a miscalculation on my part.

Wait, so yes, when v=0, u is c/n, which is correct.

So the formula is:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n ) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c)

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c ) / (n c + v ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancels, so:

u = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

= c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

But wait, looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (1 +n*v)/(n+v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n*v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n*v)/(n + v )

Wait, but our expression is [ c (c + n v) ] / [n c +v ]

But in the options, the units seem to be in terms of c as 1. Because the question says to take c=1. So let's substitute c=1.

Then our expression becomes:

u = [ (1 + n v ) * 1 ] / (n *1 + v )

= (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A. Wait, option A is (1 +n*v)/(n+v), which matches this.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of the velocity transformation, I thought u = (u' + v )/( 1 + u' v /c² ), but that's when the object's speed in the moving frame is u', and we calculate u in the lab frame.

So, for u', the speed in the glass frame is c/n. So when the glass is moving at v in the lab, the lab measures u as (u' + v) / (1 + u' v /c² )

So with u' = c/n, and c=1, u' = 1/n.

So substituting, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + n v ) / ( n + v )

Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam travels through a glass medium with a refractive index \( n \), and the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the beam. The speed of light in the glass, in its rest frame, is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator by multiplying through by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches the expression given in option A. To verify, consider the following limits:

1. If \( v = 0 \), the glass is stationary, and the speed of light in the glass should be \( \frac{1}{n} \). Substituting \( v = 0 \) into the formula confirms this result.
2. If \( n = 1 \), the medium is a vacuum, and the speed of light should always be \( 1 \) (in units where \( c = 1 \)). Substituting \( n = 1 \) into the formula also confirms this result.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This corresponds to option A.
