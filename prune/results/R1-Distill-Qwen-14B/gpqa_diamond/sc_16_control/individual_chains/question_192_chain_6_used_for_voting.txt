Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, which means a hollow space. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta. And l, L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, so I need to find the electric field at point P. Let me recall some concepts. I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. But since the conductor is initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right! When a charge is inside a conductor's cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral overall (uncharged), the outer surface must then have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the inner surface. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the conductor was initially neutral. So when you put a +q charge inside the cavity, it will induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a +q charge to balance it out.

Wait no, that can't be. Because if the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, but its charges redistribute. Hmm, wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface will have -q (because it's induced by +q), and the outer surface must have +q so the total conductor's charge is (-q + +q) = 0. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the conductor was neutral, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must cancel each other.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the +q in the cavity attracts the electrons, which move to the inner surface. Then, the conductor's remaining charge (which was zero) would have a net charge on the outer surface. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner surface is -q. Wait, no, because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the sum of inner and outer must be zero. So if the inner is -q, the outer must be +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q. Because the conductor itself is neutral, but the induced charges cause redistribution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The cavity has a charge +q. This induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner is -q. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, because the conductor's own charges: the inner surface has -q, so the remaining conductor (the outer part) must have +q to make the total zero. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, now I'm a bit confused. Wait, let me think: the conductor is neutral. The cavity has +q. The inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Then, the remaining part of the conductor (the material outside the cavity but inside the conductor) must have a charge that, when added to the inner and the outer, equals the conductor's total charge (which is zero). So, inner is -q, outer is +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface has +q.

So, when we are outside the conductor (point P is outside), the electric field due to the charges on the conductor is determined by the total enclosed charge. Because the conductor is a spherical shell, and the outer surface charge is +q, the electric field at any point outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center.

Wait, that's the shell theorem. So for a spherical charge distribution, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were at the center.

So the conductor's outer surface has +q, so at point P, the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but wait. Point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, so the position of P is not directly aligned with the center of the cavity. But for the conductor's outer surface, the charge is distributed spherically symmetrically. So the electric field outside depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor, which is L.

Wait, that's right. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge is symmetric, so the field outside is the same as a point charge at the center. So regardless of where P is, as long as it's outside, the field depends only on L.

Wait, but in this problem, the point P is outside but not necessarily aligned with the center of the cavity. But the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the field at P is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance L from the center.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (q)/(L²), multiplied by 1/(4πε₀). So that would seem to be the answer.

But wait, why are other options considering l and theta? Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the setup again. The conductor is a sphere of radius R, with a cavity of radius r, whose center is s away from the conductor's center. The charge +q is somewhere inside the cavity. But the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface will have -q, and the outer will have +q. So the conductor itself, as a shell, behaves as if it has a charge +q on the outside, so the field outside is as if all that charge were at the center.

So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity (since the conductor's inner surface will adjust to -q), the field outside is the same as a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So the distance from the center (L) is what matters.

So at point P, the distance from the center is L, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

Wait, but why are the other options present? Let me check. Option A is (l - s cosθ)^2. That would be the case if the charge was at the center of the cavity, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, even if the charge is placed elsewhere, the conductor's outer surface compensates, so the field outside is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's inner surface is induced by the charge inside. So the inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q. So the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, which would produce a field at P of (1/(4πε₀)) (q)/(L²), regardless of where the charge +q was placed inside the cavity.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance of $P$ from the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, regardless of the distribution of charges inside. By the shell theorem, the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$, and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they involve distances $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor and the distance $L$ from its center.

Answer: B
