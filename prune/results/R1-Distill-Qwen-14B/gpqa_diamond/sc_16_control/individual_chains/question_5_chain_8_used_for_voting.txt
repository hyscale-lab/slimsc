Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, specifically for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. 

For P_x, the matrix is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

For P_y, the matrix is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And for P_z, the matrix is:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

So, the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane would be a linear combination of these components. In general, any direction in space can be represented with spherical coordinates, but here it's specifically in the x-z plane, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right?

Wait, no, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it's (n_x, 0, n_z). The magnitude would be 1, so n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but wait no—maybe I got that reversed. Usually, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ * cosφ. But since φ is 0 here, n_x = sinθ. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Is that right? Wait, yes, because when φ is 0, the x-component is sinθ and the z-component is cosθ.

So the operator P along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write that out. So P = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Each P component is multiplied by ħ/2. So let's substitute:

P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute each part. Let's compute the matrices:

First part: sinθ * [ [0,1],[1,0] ] * (ħ/2) equals:
[ [0, sinθ*(ħ/2)], [sinθ*(ħ/2), 0] ]

Second part: cosθ * [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] * (ħ/2) equals:
[ [cosθ*(ħ/2), 0], [0, -cosθ*(ħ/2)] ]

Adding these two matrices together:

Top-left element: cosθ*(ħ/2)
Top-right: sinθ*(ħ/2)
Bottom-left: sinθ*(ħ/2)
Bottom-right: -cosθ*(ħ/2)

So the full P matrix is:
[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-ħ/2 cosθ) ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Which means (P - (+ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Let me write the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I):

Top-left: (ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2) = (ħ/2)(cosθ -1)
Top-right: (ħ/2 sinθ)
Bottom-left: (ħ/2 sinθ)
Bottom-right: (-ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2) = (-ħ/2)(cosθ +1 )

So the matrix is:

[ (ħ/2)(cosθ -1), (ħ/2) sinθ ]
[ (ħ/2) sinθ, (-ħ/2)(cosθ +1 ) ]

We can factor out (ħ/2) from each element to simplify:

(ħ/2) * [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ]
          [ sinθ, -(cosθ +1) ]

So the matrix equation becomes (after factoring out ħ/2, which is a scalar and can be ignored for the purposes of solving the homogeneous equations):

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ     ] [a]   [0]
[   sinθ      -(cosθ +1) ] [b] = [0]

So now we have two equations:

1. (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Let me write equation 1 as:

(cosθ -1) a = -sinθ b
=> a = [ -sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] b
But cosθ -1 is -(1 - cosθ), so this becomes a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

I can simplify sinθ/(1 - cosθ). Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2) * b

Alternatively, a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Let me write the eigenvector as [a; b]. Since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple, let's express a in terms of b and choose a convenient value for b.

Let's let b = sin(theta/2). Then a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the components would be a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). But wait, wait, let me think about that again.

Wait, earlier I found a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So if I set b = sin(theta/2), then a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector is [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but when you have sin(theta/2), if theta is zero, that would be sin(0) = 0, so [cos(0) =1, 0], which makes sense because along the z-axis (theta=0), the +1/2 eigenstate is (1,0). Similarly, for theta=pi, which is along the negative z-axis, sin(theta/2) would be sin(pi/2)=1, cos(pi/2)=0, so the vector would be [0,1], which is correct because along -z, the +1/2 state is (0,1).

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but we have to normalize it. The norm is sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) = sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1. So it's already normalized.

Wait, but the operator P is along n, which is in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector should be in the eigenbasis of the spin component along n. So the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down along n.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], and for -ħ/2 it's [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ] or something like that. Wait, let me check.

Wait, when theta is zero, the direction is along +z. So the eigenvector is [1, 0], which is correct for the +1/2 eigenstate. When theta is pi, direction is along -z, so the eigenstate would be [0,1], which is indeed [cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1]. So the expression seems correct.

Now looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the question says the eigenvector should be normalized. In our case, the vector is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)). Hmm, but our derived vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the normalized eigenvector". So option C is normalized. So that's the one.

Wait, but wait a second, the operator P is in terms of ħ/2 times the matrices, so the eigenvalue is ħ/2, right? So that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the eigenvector calculation. Because sometimes with spin matrices, the eigenvectors might have different forms.

Wait, another approach: The general eigenstate for spin-1/2 along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the answer should be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Yes, that's the one. So the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so option C.

To determine the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Operator Construction**:  
   The operator $\vec{P}$ is a linear combination of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, weighted by the direction cosines of $\vec{n}$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Thus,  
   \[
   P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
   \]  
   Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ (each scaled by $\hbar/2$), the resulting matrix for $P$ is:  
   \[
   P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ 
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is $(P - \lambda I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Subtracting $\lambda I$ from $P$, the matrix becomes:  
   \[
   P - \lambda I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
   \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ 
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the system of equations simplifies to:  
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector Components**:  
   From the first equation, $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ (to ensure normalization), we find $a = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector components are:  
   \[
   |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 
   \cos(\theta/2) \\ 
   \sin(\theta/2) 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   This vector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing with the given options, the normalized eigenvector corresponds to **Option C**:  
   \[
   (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)).
   \]
