Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. Oh right, that relates to the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation. At a certain temperature, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, and k is the Boltzmann constant. So if the energy levels have a certain ΔE, the ratio of their populations depends on temperature.

In this case, the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is n1_upper / n1_lower, and for star_2 it's n2_upper / n2_lower. The problem says that n1_upper/n1_lower is twice (n2_upper/n2_lower). So (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2*(n2_upper/n2_lower).

Wait, but wait, since the energy difference is the same for both stars, ΔE is the same. So for each star, the ratio is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Assuming that in both cases, the statistical weights (g_upper/g_lower) are the same (since it's the same transition in iron atoms), then the ratio depends only on temperature.

So the ratio for star_1 is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and for star_2 it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). But wait, wait, no. Because the ratio is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So if the upper level is higher, then the exponent is negative.

Wait, the question says that the energy difference is about 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is fixed.

So, the ratio for star_1 is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2 it's (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower).

So, 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) ) = ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) - (ΔE)/(k T2) ) = - (ΔE)/(k T1 )

Hmm, let's rearrange terms.

Bring the terms involving T to one side. Let's move the (ΔE)/(k T2) to the other side.

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, but wait. Wait, when I have the equation:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k T2)) ) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ]

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me re-do the earlier steps.

We have:

2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ]

Bring the terms to one side:

ln(2) = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] + [ ΔE/(k T2) ]

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, that's:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ]

Hmm, but I'm supposed to find an equation involving T1 and T2 without ΔE or k because the options don't have these terms. So perhaps I can divide both sides by ΔE/k.

Wait, but how does that help me? Let's see.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for T1 and T2.

Let me write the equation again:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Hmm, but I don't have values for ΔE or k. So perhaps I can express this as a ratio involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let's see: Let me factor the right side as (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ].

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes! So:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, but the question is about which equation is correct for the effective temperatures. The options are in terms of T1 and T2, but my equation has ΔE and k. The options don't have ΔE; perhaps I can consider that the ΔE/k term is a constant, but the options don't show that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the energy difference is given, but maybe the ratio of the populations depends on the ratio of their Boltzmann factors.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The ratio of the excitation for star 1 to star 2 is 2, so:

(n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper/n_lower)_2.

But (n_upper/n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] = -ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

So same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write this equation as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Which would be:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k, so maybe I can rearrange the equation to get T1 and T2 in terms of each other without the constants.

Wait, but the problem gives the ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k (since k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K). Wait, yes! Because Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.380649 × 10^−23 J/K.

So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k times 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K into the equation:

ln(2) = (k * 1 K) / (k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because (ΔE/k) = (k * 1 K) / k ) = 1 K / K = 1.

So the equation becomes ln(2) = 1 * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1 times T2). Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2), which matches.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2)

Yes, so that's correct. So the correct equation is option D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and it is observed that the excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the statistical weights are assumed to be the same for both stars, the excitation ratio depends only on temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right),
\]

respectively. The problem states that the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that for star_2:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to \( k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)). Substituting \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) into the equation, the \( k \) terms cancel out:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
