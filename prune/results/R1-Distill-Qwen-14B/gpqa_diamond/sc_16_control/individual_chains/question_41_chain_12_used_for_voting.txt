Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's think. The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. And we need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium doesn't just add up with the medium's velocity like in classical mechanics. Because light always moves at speed c in a vacuum, right? But when it's in a medium, it's slower, depending on the refractive index. So the speed in the medium is c/n. But wait, how does the motion of the medium affect this?

I think I need to use special relativity here because we're dealing with velocities that might add up in a non-classical way. Oh wait, but v is the velocity of the glass, and it's moving at a constant velocity, so maybe Galilean addition isn't enough. Wait, but for velocities much less than c, maybe it's okay. But the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c, which is the usual setup.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving with velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, so from the lab frame, how does that affect its speed?

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. But when the glass is moving, we have to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when the medium is moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the lab frame isn't just c/n + v. Because that's only the case when v is much smaller than c, but the problem doesn't specify that v is small. So we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the relativistic formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, but here, in the medium's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n. So when the medium is moving at speed v, what is the observed speed from the lab frame?

Wait, but wait. No. Let me clarify the frames. Let me define the lab frame as S, and the glass's frame as S', which is moving at speed v relative to S. So in S' (glass's frame), the light is moving at u' = c/n. We want to find the speed u in the lab frame S.

But wait, the direction is important. The glass is moving towards the observer, so the direction of v is towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as v. So in S', the light is moving in the same direction as the velocity v of S' relative to S.

So applying the relativistic velocity addition formula:

u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' * v)/(c²)]

But wait, no. Because in S', the speed is u' = c/n, and the direction is the same as v. So the formula would be:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula is such that if an object in S' has velocity u', then in S, it's u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

So substituting u' = c/n:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c)

So the denominator is (n c + v) / (n c )

Wait, wait, let me compute:

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c) = [n c + v ] / (n c )

So putting it all together:

u = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me recompute.

Wait, numerator is (c/n + v ) = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is (n c + v )/(n c )

So when you divide numerator by denominator, it's ( (c + n v)/n ) * (n c )/(n c + v )

Simplify:

= [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

So that's [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but wait, the options don't look like that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, all options are in terms of 1 and v, but perhaps the problem is considering a different approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake because the light is in the glass, which is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the glass is c/n, and the glass is moving at v. So the observer in the lab would see the light's speed as (c/n + v) if velocities just add, but that's only correct at non-relativistic speeds. But the problem states that c=1, which suggests that it's a normalized unit, maybe using natural units where c=1.

Wait, if c is taken as 1 (so c=1), then the speed of light in the glass is 1/n.

So in the glass frame, the light's speed is 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v. So the observer in the lab would see the light moving at u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v )

Because in the frame moving at velocity v, the light speed is 1/n, so applying the relativistic addition formula.

So let's compute this:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / [ 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ]

But in the options, all terms are scaled by 1, so perhaps we can factor out 1. Let's factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me compute:

Numerator: (1/n) + v = (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n

So u = [ (1 +n v)/n ] / [ (n +v)/n ] = (1 +n v )/(n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v ), which matches.

Wait, but wait, what if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light? In the glass's frame, the light is going in the same direction as the glass's velocity, so when you apply the velocity addition, the signs are correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving towards the observer as well, same direction as the glass's velocity.

So the velocity addition should be correct as I did earlier.

So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I should double-check that I didn't mess up any signs. The formula u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²) — but since in this case, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so u' is the speed in the glass frame (1/n), and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab.

Yes, so the formula applies as is.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is propagating through the glass with a refractive index \( n \). In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \) in this problem). 

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**
