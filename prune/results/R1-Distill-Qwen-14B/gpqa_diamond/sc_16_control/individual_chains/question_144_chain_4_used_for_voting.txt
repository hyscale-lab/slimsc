Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a specific value in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the meson and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime and the velocity. But how do I get the lifetime from the given data?

I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. So Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time. The relation should be Γ * τ = ħ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, let me get the units right. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units of GeV·s or something. Let me recall the value of ħ. Oh, right, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. But wait, Γ is in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So I'll have to convert units correctly.

So Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875, so τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 seconds. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.568, so 20.568e-25 seconds is 2.0568e-24 seconds. Yes, that's correct.

Now that I have the lifetime τ, the next step is to find the velocity of the meson. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. To find the velocity, I think I need to use relativistic energy equations.

I remember that the total energy E is related to the rest mass energy m c² and the momentum p c via E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p c: p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

But wait, E and m are both in GeV, but c is in m/s. I might need to handle the units properly here. Alternatively, perhaps I can work in natural units where c=1, but for the velocity, I probably need to compute beta, which is v/c.

Wait, another approach: the velocity can be found using the relation E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. And gamma is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), where beta is v/c.

But using E = gamma m c², let's see. Let me compute gamma. E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E_X / (m_X c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

But wait, in the equation, E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Since E and m are both in GeV, and c² is (m/s)^2, but in natural units where c=1, the energy and mass are in the same units. So perhaps I can compute gamma as E/(m). So 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma = 6.6667.

Once I have gamma, I can find beta. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So 1/gamma² = 1 - beta². So beta² = 1 - 1/gamma². Let's compute that.

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 = 44.444... So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. Therefore, beta² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 c.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * c, where c is about 3e8 m/s. So that's about 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance is c * tau * beta. Wait, because during the lifetime, the meson would move a distance v * tau, which is beta c tau. So distance L = v tau = beta c tau.

So let's compute that. L = beta c tau.

We have beta ≈ 0.9887, c = 3e8 m/s, tau ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds.

So let me compute beta * c * tau.

First, beta c is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s ≈ (2.966 * 2.0568) * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.0568 is approximately... Let's compute that. 3 * 2 is 6, but let's do it accurately.

2.966 * 2.0568 ≈ let's compute 3 *2.0568 is 6.1704, but subtract (0.034 *2.0568). 0.034 *2=0.068; 0.034 *0.0568≈ 0.001931. So total 0.069931. So 6.1704 - 0.069931 ≈ 6.1005.

So the product is approximately 6.1005e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me redo that part.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. So gamma = 6.6667.

So beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (1/(44.444...)) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887. Correct.

So beta is about 0.9887.

Now, let's compute the decay length.

L = beta c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV. Wait, no, wait. tau is ħ / (Γ). Oh wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau is (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 2.0568e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.0568e-24 = (2.966 * 2.0568) * 1e(8-24) ) = 6.1007 * 1e-16 m.

So approximately 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the answer options is 6.1e-16. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, so none of these match 6e-16. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let's recompute tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau is ħ divided by Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 ÷ 0.32:

Well, 0.32 × 20 =6.4, so 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4. So 20 + 0.182/0.32. 0.182 /0.32 is approximately 0.56875.

So 20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. So that part is correct.

Ah, but wait! I think I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me double-check the calculation of beta.

Gamma = 6.6667.

So beta^2 = 1 - (1/(gamma^2)).

Gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/(gamma^2) = 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225.

Thus, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.

So beta is about 0.9887 c.

So the calculation of L is correct, but why isn't the answer matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the decay length is L = c * tau * beta.

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the meson's rest frame. The observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau.

So the decay distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is beta c multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait, that's an alternative approach. Let me try that.

So L = v * t_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

Because t_lab = gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, which is correct?

Hmm, I think I might have confused the proper lifetime and the lab frame lifetime. Let me clarify.

In the meson's rest frame, the lifetime is tau. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma (time dilation). So the lifetime in the lab frame is t = gamma tau.

The velocity is v = beta c.

So the decay distance L is v multiplied by t, which is beta c * gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Earlier, I thought L = beta c tau, but that would be the case if tau is the lab lifetime. But tau is the proper lifetime, so t_lab is gamma tau.

So I think my initial approach was wrong. I should have used beta gamma c tau.

So let's recalculate.

Beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's compute that.

0.9887 *6 is 5.9322, 0.9887 *0.6667 is approximately 0.6591. So together, 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈6.5913.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.0568e-24 s.

So compute 6.5913 * 3e8 * 2.0568e-24.

Let me compute each part step by step.

6.5913 *3e8 = 1.97739e9.

Multiply by 2.0568e-24: 1.97739e9 * 2.0568e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.0568) * 1e(9-24) ) = 4.0655e-15 meters.

Wait, that's approximately 4.0655e-15 meters, which matches option B or D.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's what I got.

Wait, but why did I get a different result earlier? Because I initially forgot to multiply by gamma. So the correct formula is L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Yes, that makes sense because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, and the velocity is beta c. So multiplying them gives the distance.

So the correct answer should be option B, 4.0655e-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay distance:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the meson as a fraction of the speed of light (\( v/c \)),
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the meson.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( c^2 \) is accounted for in natural units:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay distance \( L \)
Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, multiply:

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
