Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the explicit vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm. So the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, which means that in this basis, the state is represented by the given vector. Since uncertainty is involved, I think I need to use the formula for the uncertainty in an observable. The formula is ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²).

But wait, here A is P_z. So I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩ for the given state.

Wait, the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So if the state is written in that basis, then the expectation value of P_z would be the sum of the probabilities of each eigenvalue multiplied by that eigenvalue.

Let me think. The given state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to the amplitude of that eigenstate.

So the eigenvalues of P_z are the diagonal elements of its matrix. Looking at P_z's matrix:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0,0,-ħ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The diagonal entries are the eigenvalues for each basis vector.

Wait, the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, so each |i> corresponds to eigenvalue λ_i. So the first basis vector has eigenvalue ħ, the second 0, and the third -ħ.

So the state |ψ> is a linear combination of these eigenvectors. The components are the coefficients in this expansion.

So the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for the first eigenstate (eigenvalue ħ), the second component 1/√2 for the second eigenstate (eigenvalue 0), and the third component -1/2 for the third eigenstate (eigenvalue -ħ).

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value. Since the state is in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is sum |c_i|^2 * λ_i.

So each |c_i|² is the probability.

Let's compute |c_1|², |c_2|², |c_3|².

c_1 = -1/2 → |c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c_2 = 1/√2 → |c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c_3 = -1/2 → |c3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) ) → 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is the same as the operator applied twice, but in the eigenbasis, each eigenstate |i> has P_z²|i> = (λ_i)^2 |i>.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum |c_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2.

Calculating each term:

For i=1: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = ħ²/4.

i=2: (1/2) * (0)^2 = 0.

i=3: (1/4) * ( -ħ )^2 = ħ²/4.

Summing these: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/(2) ) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Wait, but am I sure about this? Let me double-check.

The state is given as a column vector in the basis of P_z's eigenstates. So each component is correct, and the coefficients correctly give the probabilities when squared. So the expectation value calculations seem correct.

Another point: since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but in the P_z basis, the expectation values of P_z are calculated as above. So the uncertainty comes out to be ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for the given state, we use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The state is given as the column vector $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, and the basis vectors are the eigenstates of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal elements of its matrix representation.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are the probabilities $|c_i|^2$ (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$):

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ squares the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Therefore:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot (\hbar)^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot (0)^2 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar)^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
