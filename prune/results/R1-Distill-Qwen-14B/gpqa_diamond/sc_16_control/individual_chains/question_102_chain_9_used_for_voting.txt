Okay, so I've got this complex question here about molecular biology techniques and genetic constructs. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They created a bicistronic vector using lox-P sites and IRES elements. Then they transfected primary astrocytes and also made a mouse model. When they checked the expression in the mouse with SOX10-Cre, they didn't see any green signal. Why?

First, let me think about what each part of the construct means. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at its C-terminus. Both are under different promoters? Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. The receptor is after IRES, which is a regulatory element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so maybe it's a separate promoter? Or perhaps the IRES is just a way to allow translation of the second gene without a strong promoter. I'm a bit fuzzy on that detail.

The stops for each are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So for the ligand, the stop is in a loxP cassette. If Cre is present, it would recombine and remove the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. I think Cre might recognize loxP sites but not lox2272, or vice versa? Wait, lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't recognize but another recombinase like FLP can. So if the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and they cross with SOX10-Cre, which should only express Cre, then which sites would be cut?

Wait, let me get this straight. The ligand ORF is first, then a stop in loxP-stop-loxP. Then the receptor is after IRES, and its stop is in lox2272. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites will be cut, removing the stop, so the ligand and mCherry would be expressed together. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor wouldn't be expressed because the stop remains unless another recombinase is used.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Oh, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The vector uses lox sites for excision. So normally, without Cre, the stops are in place. When Cre is present, it deletes the loxP sites and the stops, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, so perhaps the Cre is used to delete the stop cassettes. So for the ligand, the stop is within a loxP cassette. So with Cre, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand (with mCherry) to be expressed. For the receptor, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, which Cre cannot remove because lox2272 is a different site. So the receptor ORF is under the IRES, but the stop isn't removed, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, meaning both genes are on the same transcript. So the ligand is first, then the receptor, but each with their own stops and reporters.

Wait, but how does the IRES work here. The IRES is an internal ribosome binding site, which allows for translation of the downstream gene without a second promoter. So the first gene (ligand) is under a promoter, like CBA, then after that, the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor.

But each ORF has a stop with a loxP or lox2272 site. So without Cre, both stops are in place. When Cre is introduced, the loxP site is cut, so the ligand ORF is expressed (since the stop is removed). The receptor's stop is in a lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor's ORF remains under the stop. So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor wouldn't.

But wait, the initial problem says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre would express Cre in specific tissues, like the neural crest perhaps.

Wait, but if the Cre is active, it would delete the loxP stops but not the lox2272 stops. So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor's stop isn't removed. So the receptor remains not expressed. But then, how does that affect the experiment?

Wait, the experiment is about visualizing the receptor-eGFP under the confocal. They don't see green. So the receptor isn't expressed because its stop isn't removed. But why would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the construct isn't being correctly expressed. Let's think about the vector: the ligand is first, then the receptor, separated by IRES. The ligand has a loxP stop, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop. If Cre is present, like in the mouse, it would only remove the ligand's stop, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the receptor with eGFP isn't expressed.

But then the mouse was made homozygous for the construct. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would delete the loxP sites, but the lox2272 remains. So in the offspring, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor wouldn't. So when they look for eGFP (receptor's tag), they don't see it. So that would explain the lack of green signal.

But why would the construct not express the receptor? The problem is that the mouse is homozygous. Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct, so each allele would have the same setup. When Cre is present, each allele would have the ligand expressed because the stop is removed, but the receptor's stop isn't touched.

Wait, but the question is about the mice crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic line where Cre is under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So perhaps the Cre is only active in the neural crest, but maybe the vector is designed so that the ligand and receptor are expressed there.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which is in the wt background. So when they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, causing the loxP sites to be cut. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But the question is about why the green signal (receptor-eGFP) isn't observed. So the answer would be that the receptor isn't expressed because its stop isn't removed. Why? Because the cassettes are of different types.

Wait, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

Hmm, that would mean they act on different cells, but the question is about expression in the same cells, perhaps. Not directly related to the observation.

B) receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would be a problem with protein trafficking, but the expression levels would be low, not absent. Also, in the Western blot, they might have seen the protein but not in the right place. But in the mouse model, they're looking for GFP under confocal, which is a live cell imaging. So if the protein isn't even expressed, there's no signal. But if it's stuck in Golgi, the GFP might still be present but not on the surface, but some might be retained, so maybe some weak signal. But the question says no green signal.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, but the construct has promoters (ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter). The receptor is after IRES. So the presence of promoter is okay.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. So if the stop is in the way, the reading frame might be messed up. For instance, after the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP would be in the same frame. If the stop is there, the receptor is not expressed. Or if the frames are misaligned, the eGFP might not be correctly fused.

Wait, but the vector is designed with the receptor and eGFP in the same frame? If the stop is in place, the receptor's ORF is terminated. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. But if the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed as a fusion protein. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

But in the case of the mouse, the Cre would remove the ligand's stop but not the receptor's. So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor would not. So in the mouse, they would see mCherry (if expressed) but not eGFP.

Wait, no, the vector is bicistronic, so both ORFs are on the same transcript. The CBA promoter drives the transcription of both ORFs. The IRES allows the translation of the receptor after the ligand.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

The construct is:

5' [Ligand ORF] [stop in loxP cassette] IRES [Receptor ORF] [stop in lox2272 cassette] 3'

So, in the absence of Cre, the stops are in place. So the transcript includes both ORFs, but the stops prevent their expression. The presence of Cre would remove the loxP stops, allowing the ligand to be expressed. The lox2272 stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but I thought the IRES allows the second ORF to be translated. Oh, wait, but if the first ORF's stop is in a loxP cassette, then without Cre, that ORF is not expressed. But with Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the receptor's stop is still in place because the lox2272 isn't cut.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand, so the ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter, followed by IRES, and then the receptor ORF. Both ORFs would be in the same transcript. But the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor's is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

So in the presence of Cre, the loxP cassette is removed, so the ligand ORF is expressed. The IRES would then allow the translation of the receptor ORF, but the stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't remove, so the receptor's ORF is not expressed.

Wait, no. Because if the ligand's stop is removed, the ligand is expressed, but the transcript continues. The IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor's ORF, but the stop is in the lox2272, preventing expression. So the receptor's ORF is still not expressed.

Wait, but without the stop, the receptor's ORF would be expressed. So perhaps the presence of the stop in the lox2272 prevents the receptor from being expressed unless another recombinase is present.

So in the mouse, which is homozygous for the construct, and crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre would delete the loxP in both alleles, allowing the ligand to be expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor remains under the stop. So the receptor isn't expressed.

But why is the Western blot mentioned? They transfected the construct into primary astrocytes and did a Western blot. The result was that total proteins' signal is proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the blot is working. But the problem is that when they made the mouse model, they didn't see the eGFP.

Another possibility is that the vector wasn't successfully integrated, or the expression wasn't happening. But the question states that they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, so the vector is present.

Wait, the problem says that after transfection of the plasmid into astrocytes, they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on the Western blot. So perhaps in the astrocytes, the ligand and receptor were expressed, but in the mouse, perhaps only the ligand is expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is made by homologous recombination, perhaps a knock-in, so the construct is in the genome.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The vector is a bicistronic construct, but the way the lox sites are arranged might cause both genes to not be expressed. Or perhaps the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES doesn't function unless the first gene is expressed. So without the ligand's ORF being expressed, the IRES doesn't work. But in this case, with Cre, the ligand is expressed, so the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but with Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's stop is still present because the lox2272 stop can't be cut by Cre. So the receptor's ORF is not expressed. Therefore, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed, so no green signal.

So in the offspring, the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green signal. So the issue is that the receptor's ORF isn't expressed because its stop isn't removed.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the ORF isn't correctly aligned, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional eGFP. But in that case, the Western blot would show a band if the protein is expressed, but perhaps it's not. But in the mouse model, if the stop is in place, the receptor isn't expressed. If the stop is removed, but the frame is wrong, the protein might be expressed but not functional, but you'd see a signal on Western if there's expression.

But in the mouse, the stop is still in place, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the reason for no green signal is because the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that the receptor is under the IRES. If the IRES works, the receptor should be expressed when the ligand is. But the stop is preventing it.

Wait, maybe the IRES requires the ligand's ORF to be in frame so that it's translated, and then the IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be translated. But if the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, the IRES may not function. So perhaps the receptor isn't expressed because the ligand's ORF is terminated.

In this case, the presence of the stop in the ligand's ORF (even without Cre) would prevent the IRES from functioning, meaning the receptor isn't expressed. But that's without Cre.

Wait, no. Because without Cre, the ligand's stop is in place, so the ligand isn't expressed. The IRES is after the ligand ORF, so if the ligand's ORF isn't expressed, perhaps the IRES doesn't function. So the receptor isn't expressed either.

Wait, but the IRES allows the translation of the second ORF regardless of the first. So even if the first ORF's translation is terminated, the IRES would allow the ribosome to initiate translation of the second ORF.

So perhaps the presence of the stop in the ligand's ORF wouldn't prevent the IRES from allowing the receptor's translation.

But in this case, the ligand's stop is in a loxP cassette, which is removed by Cre. So without Cre, the ligand's stop is in place, so ligand isn't expressed, but the IRES would allow the receptor's expression.

Wait, but the receptor's stop is in a lox2272, which Cre can't remove. So if the mouse has Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. If there's no Cre, the ligand's stop remains, so ligand isn't expressed, but the receptor's stop is in place too, so receptor isn't expressed either.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have the construct. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, Cre would delete the loxP stops in both alleles, allowing ligand expression. But the receptor's stops are still in place, so receptor isn't expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains. The reason for no green signal is that the receptor's ORF isn't expressed because its stop isn't removed.

So looking at the options again:

Option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

If the stop remains, the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, if the frame is wrong, perhaps even when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the stop isn't removed for the receptor. So the issue is that the stop remains. So why is the stop remaining? Because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre. So the reason is that the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the issue is that the IRES is after the ligand, but the receptor's ORF is blocked by its own stop, which isn't removed.

Looking at the options, the only one that relates to the receptor not being expressed is option D, but wait, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame, which would be a problem with the reading frame. But in our case, the problem is the stop is present, not the frame.

Hmm, none of the options directly address the stop cassette issue. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. So the enhancer should be present.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop is removed, but the ORFs are out of frame, the eGFP might not be expressed. But in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the option D is about whether the ORF is in frame. If the construct was designed correctly, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame. If they're not, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't show up in the Western blot.

Wait, but the mouse's issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the problem isn't the frame. So none of the options directly address the stop remaining, but maybe the answer is D because the stop is after the receptor ORF, making it not in frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each option again.

Option A: paracrine. If the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, that means they're secreted and act on other cells. But the question is about their interaction in neural crest cells. If they're in paracrine, maybe the ligand isn't binding the receptor in the same cell, but that doesn't explain why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Option B: stuck in Golgi. That would affect localization, but the protein would still be expressed. The Western blot would detect it, but maybe not in the right place, but the confocal wouldn't see GFP on the surface.

Option C: missing enhancer. Both are under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so enhancer shouldn't be an issue.

Option D: not in frame. If the receptor and eGFP are in different frames, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed, leading to no signal. Or perhaps, the stop is in the wrong place, so when removed, the frame shifts.

Wait, but in the absence of Cre, both stops are present, so both ORFs are not expressed. With Cre, only the ligand's stop is removed. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's stop remains. So the receptor's ORF isn't expressed.

But wait, the mouse's problem is that after using SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show green. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the only way that could happen is if the eGFP isn't being made. The eGFP is directly after the receptor's ORF, and is part of the same ORF. So if the receptor's ORF isn't being translated, the eGFP isn't either.

So why isn't the receptor's ORF being translated? Because the stop is present.

But none of the options directly say that the stop isn't removed. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not functioning properly. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor's ORF isn't translated. But the presence of the IRES suggests it's functional.

Wait, maybe the vector design is such that the receptor is only expressed when the ligand's ORF is translated, and the IRES requires proper positioning. But without the ligand's ORF being correctly expressed, the IRES might not function.

Wait, but the ligand is expressed when Cre is present, so the IRES should function, allowing the receptor's ORF to be translated. But since the stop is still present in the receptor, it isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the possible answers again.

The correct reason for no green signal is that the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. The reason it isn't expressed is because the stop isn't removed. The stop isn't removed because it's in a lox2272, which Cre can't act on. So the construct's design is such that the receptor's ORF can't be expressed with Cre.

But none of the options directly address that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the vector's design is such that when the ligand is expressed, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. But if the stop is in the way, perhaps the frame is incorrect. So if the stop is removed, the frame would shift, making the eGFP not in frame.

Wait, but in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop remains. But all the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the real issue is that the IRES isn't allowing the receptor's expression.

But the question is about the absence of green signal.

Looking back at the options, option D is about the ORFs not being in the same frame. So if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, their expression would lead to a nonfunctional or absent eGFP. But in the mouse, the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let's think about the vector design again.

The vector is bicistronic: ligand followed by receptor, with IRES between them. The ligand's ORF has a loxP stop, and the receptor's has a lox2272 stop. So when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Therefore, the reason is that the receptor's ORF is not expressed because its stop isn't removed. But looking at the options, none directly state this.

Wait, looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So if they're not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the mouse, the stop is still present, so it's irrelevant. So the correct answer must be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not working because the ligand's ORF isn't correctly expressed, but that's without Cre.

Wait, but the presence of Cre allows ligand expression, so IRES should function.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is D. Because if the ORFs are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed even if the stop is removed. But in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless. So I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The vector is a bicistronic construct, with two ORFs. The ligand is in the 5' ORF, and the receptor in the 3' ORF. The ligand's ORF has a stop in a loxP cassette, the receptor's ORF has a stop in a lox2272. So when Cre is present, the ligand's ORF is expressed, but the receptor's isn't. So in the mouse, only the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't cut by Cre.

But none of the options talk about the lox sites or the recombinase. So perhaps the correct answer is another option.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the receptor isn't expressed, the eGFP isn't either.

Looking back, the options:

A) Paracrine relationship. No, that's about function, not expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If expressed, it would be in Golgi, but the question is about expression.

C) Enhancer missing. Both promoters are present.

D) Not in frame. So if the ORFs are not in frame, eGFP isn't expressed. But in the mouse, the stop remains, so even if in frame, it's not expressed.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Another thought: the stop in the lox2272 cassette may not be correctly positioned, causing a frameshift. For example, if the stop is in the middle of the ORF, removing it could cause the reading frame to shift, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP. But only if the stop is removed. But in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed at all.

Wait, but the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed, not that it's not functional. So the real issue is that the stop isn't removed.

But the options don't address the lox sites. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B. If the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the cell surface, but would accumulate in the Golgi and not fluoresce. But the question says no green signal at all. So that might not fit.

Wait, the vector for the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the protein is properly trafficked, eGFP would be on the cell surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be expressed on the surface, but might still be present intracellularly. So perhaps when they do the Western blot, they would see the eGFP, but not in the live cell imaging. But the question says they only use the Western blot for the initial testing. The mouse model is for live imaging.

In the mouse, they don't see green, so perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue is the eGFP isn't being made.

So the only way that would happen is if the stop remains, which is because the lox2272 isn't cut.

But the options don't address that. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, wait, another angle: If the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, and the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, perhaps the IRES doesn't function, preventing the receptor's translation. But when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, so the IRES can function, allowing the receptor's translation. But then, the receptor's stop is in the way.

Wait, but without the stop, the receptor would be expressed. So if the stop isn't removed, the receptor isn't expressed.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The correct answer is D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Because if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no signal. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with the ligand ORF under the CBA promoter and the receptor ORF downstream of an IRES element. The ligand's ORF contains a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, while the receptor's ORF contains a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. SOX10-Cre mice were used to activate Cre, which removes the loxP-based stop cassette but cannot remove the lox2272-based stop cassette. This setup was used to study the developmental fate of the ligand-receptor interaction in a mouse model. However, no green signal (eGFP) was observed when visualizing the receptor under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Function**:
   - The ligand is expressed first, followed by the receptor, with the IRES allowing translation of the receptor after the ligand.
   - The ligand's stop cassette (loxP-based) is removed by Cre, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed.
   - The receptor's stop cassette (lox2272-based) cannot be removed by Cre, preventing the receptor and eGFP from being expressed.

2. **Mouse Model and Cre Activation**:
   - In the mouse model, SOX10-Cre expression deletes the ligand's stop cassette, allowing ligand expression.
   - However, the receptor's stop cassette remains intact, preventing receptor and eGFP expression.

3. **Observed Outcome**:
   - The absence of the green signal (eGFP) indicates that the receptor and eGFP are not being expressed.
   - This is consistent with the receptor's stop cassette remaining intact, blocking its expression.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **(A) Paracrine relationship**: This describes the functional interaction between ligand and receptor but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. Incorrect.
   - **(B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi**: If the receptor were trafficked to the Golgi, some intracellular eGFP signal might still be detectable. The complete absence of green suggests no expression at all. Incorrect.
   - **(C) Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression missing**: Both ORFs are under strong promoters (CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor), so the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to be the issue. Incorrect.
   - **(D) Receptor and eGFP not in the frame**: If the receptor and eGFP ORFs are not in the same reading frame, their expression would result in a nonfunctional or absent eGFP. This aligns with the observed lack of green signal. Correct.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP. This aligns with the observed lack of fluorescence in the mouse model.

**Answer: D**
