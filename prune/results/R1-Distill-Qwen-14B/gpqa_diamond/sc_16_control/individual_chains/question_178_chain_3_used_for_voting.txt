Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability of a theory depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative, it's not. So I need to find the mass dimension of κ first.

Wait, how do I find the mass dimension of the terms in the Lagrangian? Right, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1), so the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 (since the integral is over 4-dimensional spacetime, each term must be dimension 4).

So L_int is a part of the Lagrangian, so each term in L must have dimension 4. Let's break down each part of L_int: κ, ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, F^{μν}.

First, what are the dimensions of each field? I remember that fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in general, a Dirac field has dimension (d-1)/2 where d is spacetime dimension, so 3/2 for d=4.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, like F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So A_μ is a vector potential with dimension 1, since it's a gauge field. Each derivative ∂ brings dimension 1. So F_{μν} is ∂ A, which would have dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, let's look at σ_{μν}. It's a product of gamma matrices, but more precisely, it's a commutator of γ matrices multiplied by i/2. The gamma matrices are dimensionless since they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the same as γ matrices squared? Wait, no, the commutator of two γ matrices is another matrix, but in terms of field strengths, maybe I should think of σ_{μν} as dimensionless? Or wait, no, because σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices. Wait, no, sigma is a tensor constructed from γ matrices, but perhaps dimensionless. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, but I think it's just a product of two gamma matrices in a certain combination, so maybe it's dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. The sigma_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are 4x4 matrices, but in terms of field theory, their dimension is zero because they're just operators in the Clifford algebra, not fields. So [gamma_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless, so sigma_{mu nu} is dimensionless.

So now, putting it all together: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product of all the terms should be dimension 4.

Let me compute the dimensions of each part:

ψ̄ has dimension (3/2), since ψ is 3/2, and ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension.

σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so doesn't contribute.

ψ has dimension 3/2.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, as I figured out earlier.

So putting it together:

κ * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = κ * (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, but wait, the product is:

κ * (3/2) [from ψ̄] * (dimensionless) [sigma] * (3/2) [from ψ] * [F] which is 2.

So overall, the dimensions are κ multiplied by (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Let me compute that: (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4, times 2 is 9/4 *2= 9/2.

So the total dimension of the term is (dim κ) + (9/2) = 4, because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So:

dim κ + 9/2 = 4.

So, dim κ = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 -9/2) )= (-1/2).

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because I'm looking at each factor, but wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the expression is κ multiplied by ψ̄, which is 3/2, times σ (dimensionless), times ψ (3/2), times F (2). So the product is κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2. Let me compute that:

(3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4, times 2 is 9/4 *2 = 9/2. So the entire product (excluding κ) is 9/2.

So the dimension equation is:

dim κ + 9/2 =4. So dim κ = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.

Wait, that's dimension -1/2 for κ. But wait, I'm not sure. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the dimensions of F^{mu nu}.

Wait, no, my initial thought was correct. A is a vector potential, so dimension 1. Then F is ∂A, which is dimension 1+1=2. So F is dimension 2.

So each F contributes 2. Then, in the term, we have F^{mu nu}, which is a tensor, but dimension-wise, it's 2.

Wait, but wait, the term is F^{mu nu}, which is a field, so that's correct.

So, back to the equation. So the product of the fields without κ is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = 9/2. So the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by that, and the total should be 4.

So, 9/2 + dim κ =4. So dim κ=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= (-1/2).

Wait, but the options given are about κ having mass dimension -1 or 1.

Hmm, so none of the options have -1/2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dimension of the F tensor. Let me double-check. The field strength tensor F_{mu nu} is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each derivative is dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so each term in F is dimension 2. So F_{mu nu} has dimension 2. Correct.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, F^{mu nu} is used, but that's just the same as F_mu nu with a metric tensor to raise indices. So that doesn't change the dimension. So F^{mu nu} is still dimension 2.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, dim κ is -1/2, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in how I calculated the product dimensions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}, and sigma_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor. Let me think about the dimensions again.

Wait, perhaps I should treat each term correctly. The Lagrangian term has dimension 4.

So, the term is κ times ψ̄ times σ_{mu nu} times ψ times F^{mu nu}.

Each of these terms contribute their own dimensions. Let's see:

- ψ̄: 3/2
- σ_{mu nu}: dimensionless (as it's made from gamma matrices)
- ψ: 3/2
- F^{mu nu}: 2

So the product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4)*2 = 9/2.

So the term is κ times (9/2), and the entire term must have dimension 4.

So, [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ]=4 -4.5= -0.5 → -1/2.

But the options are looking for κ having dimensions -1 or 1.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the way I counted the dimensions. Maybe sigma_{mu nu} isn't dimensionless? Or perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, another thought: the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. Sigma_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor, perhaps with dimension 1? No, that doesn't make sense because the sigma is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So sigma should be dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the term in terms of Lorentz indices. The sigma has two indices and is antisymmetric. But in terms of dimensions, each index doesn't add a dimension. So it's still dimensionless.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of the F tensor. Let me think again. A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1. F is ∂μ Aν, which would be dimension 1 (from ∂) +1 (from A) )=2. Correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the term in the Lagrangian is written as F^{mu nu}, which is a tensor, but in the Lagrangian, you can have terms like F^2, which would have dimension 4 (since each F has 2, and multiplied by another F, but wait, no, this is a single F here, not F squared.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe I should compute the dimension of each part of the term.

So, the Lagrangian term is:

κ (ψ̄) (σ_{mu nu}) (ψ) (F^{mu nu}).

Each factor's dimension:

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ_{mu nu} → 0 (since it's made from gamma matrices)

ψ → 3/2

F^{mu nu} → 2.

So the product is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4)*2 =9/2.

So the dimension of the term is [κ] + 9/2 = 4 → [κ] =4−4.5= -0.5.

But the options don't have -0.5. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps sigma_{mu nu} has a dimension. Wait, sigma_{mu nu} is antisymmetric, (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so their commutator is also dimensionless. So sigma is dimensionless. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the product of the fields. Let me recount:

Each ψ has dimension 3/2 → ψ̄ is same.

So ψ̄ * ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) )=3.

So, the term is:

κ * (ψ̄ ψ) * σ * F.

So, (ψ̄ ψ) has dimension 3.

σ is dimensionless.

F has dimension 2.

So the product is 3 * 2 =6.

So, [κ] +6 =4 → [κ] = -2.

But wait, that's even worse. Now I get [κ]=-2, which isn't any of the options either.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps the product (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) has a certain dimension.

Wait, another approach: the object σ_{mu nu} ψ is a spinor? Because sigma is a Lorentz tensor, and when you contract with ψ, which is a spinor, you get another spinor. So ψ̄ acting on that would give a scalar.

But in terms of dimensions, perhaps I should just treat each as separate.

Wait, perhaps the product ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is a scalar. So what's the dimension of that? Let's see: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2. So the product would be 3/2 + 3/2=3. So the scalar would have dimension 3. Then, multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which has dimension 2, the entire term is (3) * (2) =5. So κ must be such that the product is 4, since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4.

Wait, that can't be right because 3+2=5, so [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah, okay, that's one of the options. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

So that would mean [κ]=-1. So looking at the options, A says [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. So which is it?

Wait, the question is: what is the mass dimension of κ? And is the theory renormalizable?

So first, the dimension is -1. Now, is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling dimension. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constant must have positive or zero mass dimension. Because in perturbation theory, the number of loops (and thus divergences) is controlled by the dimension. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable because the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to more severe divergences that can't be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

So [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option A says it is renormalizable, which would be incorrect.

So the correct answer should be C: κ has mass dimension -1, theory is not renormalizable.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor field $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., for electromagnetism) has mass dimension $2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor, being a commutator of dimensionless $\gamma$-matrices, is dimensionless.

### Step 2: Dimensional analysis of the Lagrangian term
The Lagrangian term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the action is dimensionless in natural units. Breaking down the term:
\[
\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
we calculate the total dimension of the fields:
- $\bar{\psi}$ contributes $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\psi$ contributes $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

Thus, the total dimension of the field product is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]

The coupling constant $\kappa$ must ensure that the entire term has mass dimension $4$. Therefore:
\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension. Since $[\kappa] = 0$, the theory is **renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa] = 0$.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa] = 0$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa] = 0$ and the theory is renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa] = 0$ and the theory is renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **none of the options**, as the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $0$, and the theory is renormalizable. However, since the options do not include this result, the closest valid choice based on the given options is **A**, which incorrectly states $[\kappa] = -1$ but correctly identifies the theory as renormalizable.
