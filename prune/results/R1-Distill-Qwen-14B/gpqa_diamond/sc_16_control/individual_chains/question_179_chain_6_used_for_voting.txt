Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics and matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it step by step.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are about statements involving these matrices and their properties. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, let me recall some quantum mechanics basics. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is represented by a unitary matrix. Also, density matrices are positive semi-definite and have trace equal to 1 for quantum states.

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. So, this is about the matrix exponential of X. If e^X is unitary, then multiplying any vector by e^X would preserve the norm because unitary matrices preserve inner products. So, if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by e^X could change the norm. So I need to check if e^X is unitary.

Wait, but to find out if e^X is unitary, I should first check if X is skew-Hermitian because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Skew-Hermitian means X† = -X. Let me compute X† and see.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate transpose (X†) would be the transpose of the matrix with each element conjugated.

So X† would be:
Column 1: i*, 1, 2i* → -i, 1, -2i
Column 2: -1*, 0, -1* → 1, 0, 1
Column 3: 2i*, 1*, (-i)* → -2i, 1, i

Wait, wait, let me get this right. Let's construct X† properly.

Original X:
Row 1: (i, -1, 2i)
Row 2: (1, 0, 1)
Row 3: (2i, -1, -i)

So each element's complex conjugate is:

Row 1: (i*)=-i, (-1)*= -1, (2i)*= -2i
Row 2: (1*)=1, 0 remains 0, (1)*=1
Row 3: (2i)*= -2i, (-1)*= -1, (-i)*= i

Then X† is the transpose of this, so:

Take the rows as columns:

X†:
Row 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Row 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Row 3: (-2i, 1, i)

Wait, no: to transpose, the first column becomes the first row, etc. So the first column of X is i,1,2i. So the first row of X† is [i*, 1*, 2i*] → (-i, 1, -2i). The second column of X is -1, 0, -1, so the second row of X† is [-1*, 0*, (-1)*] → (-1, 0, -1). Wait, no, wait: when you take the conjugate and transpose.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each element. So X† is the conjugate transpose. So for X, element (i,j) becomes (j,i) with complex conjugation.

So X† element (1,1) is (X(1,1))* → i → -i.

X†(1,2) is X(2,1)* → 1 →1.

X†(1,3) is X(3,1)* →2i → -2i.

X†(2,1) is X(1,2)* → (-1)* → -1.

X†(2,2) is X(2,2)* → 0 → 0.

X†(2,3) is X(3,2)* → (-1)* →-1.

X†(3,1) is X(1,3)* → (2i)* → -2i.

X†(3,2) is X(2,3)* →1 →1.

X†(3,3) is X(3,3)* → (-i)* → i.

Putting it all together:

X† is:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: (-1), 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, let's compute -X to see if X† equals -X.

-X is:

Original X:
Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: 2i, -1, -i

So -X is:
Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i, 1, i

Compare this with X† as computed:

X† is:
Row1: -i, 1, -2i → same as -X's row1.
Row2: -1, 0, -1 → same as -X's row2.
Row3: -2i, 1, i → same as -X's row3.

So X† = -X. So X is skew-Hermitian. Therefore, the exponential e^X is unitary, because for skew-Hermitian matrices, e^X is unitary. So, if you multiply a vector by e^X, the norm is preserved (since unitary matrices preserve the inner product). So option A says that there exists a vector where the norm changes. But if e^X is unitary, this can't happen. So option A would be false. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state. Hmm. Quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, have trace 1, and are Hermitian. Alternatively, sometimes they talk about pure states, which are projectors, but in any case, the density matrix must be Hermitian. So (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation of Y. Let's think about this.

Since e^X is unitary, e^{-X} is (e^X)†. So (e^X)* is (e^X)†. Let me write it as U Y U†, where U is e^X. So this is the conjugation of Y by U. So the resulting matrix would have the same eigenvalues as Y. But is it Hermitian? Let's think: Y is given as a matrix of real numbers. So Y is symmetric, which means Y is Hermitian because Y† = Y.

Because Y is Hermitian, when we perform U Y U†, the result is still Hermitian. Because (U Y U†)† = U Y† U† = U Y U†.

So the resulting matrix is Hermitian. But density matrices must also be positive semi-definite and have trace 1. So whether this expression represents a quantum state depends on whether it's a valid density matrix.

Wait, but Y is given as:

Y = [
[0.5, 0.1, 0.2],
[0.1, 0.25, 0.1],
[0.2, 0.1, 0.25]
]

It's a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian. Let's check its eigenvalues. The trace of Y is 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So the trace is 1, which is good. For a density matrix, all eigenvalues must be non-negative and sum to 1.

So the question is: does Y have all non-negative eigenvalues? If yes, then after the similarity transform, the matrix would also have non-negative eigenvalues, making it a valid density matrix. So (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) would be a valid quantum state.

Alternatively, Y might have negative eigenvalues. Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of Y.

Wait, but Y is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute its determinant. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for whether it's positive semi-definite.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is positive semi-definite. Let me check if all its leading principal minors are positive.

The first leading minor is 0.5, which is positive.

The second leading minor is the determinant of the top-left 2x2 matrix: (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115, which is positive.

The third leading minor is the determinant of Y itself.

Calculating the determinant of Y:

Y = [
[0.5, 0.1, 0.2],
[0.1, 0.25, 0.1],
[0.2, 0.1, 0.25]
]

I can compute this using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let's do the cofactor expansion along the first row.

det(Y) = 0.5 * det([[0.25, 0.1], [0.1, 0.25]]) - 0.1 * det([[0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.25]]) + 0.2 * det([[0.1, 0.25], [0.2, 0.1]])

Compute each minor:

First minor: det([[0.25, 0.1], [0.1, 0.25]]) = (0.25)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.1) = 0.0625 - 0.01 = 0.0525.

Second minor: det([[0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.25]]) = (0.1)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.2) )= 0.025 - 0.02 = 0.005.

Third minor: det([[0.1, 0.25], [0.2, 0.1]]) = (0.1)(0.1) - (0.25)(0.2) = 0.01 - 0.05 = -0.04.

So putting it all together:

det(Y) = 0.5*(0.0525) - 0.1*(0.005) + 0.2*(-0.04)
= 0.02625 - 0.0005 - 0.008
= 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

So determinant is positive. So all leading minors are positive, which suggests Y is positive definite, hence positive semi-definite. Therefore, Y is a valid density matrix, meaning it represents a quantum state.

But then, (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation, which for a density matrix would result in another density matrix, because Y is density matrix and unitaries preserve the properties. So the transformed matrix would also be a density matrix, thus a quantum state. So option B seems correct. But wait, let me think again. Because (e^X) is a unitary, so the transformed Y would still be a density matrix, yes. So option B could be correct.

Option C: Z and X represent observables. Observables are Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

Let's check X first. Earlier, we saw that X† = -X, which makes X skew-Hermitian, so X is not Hermitian unless X = X†, which in this case it's not. So X is skew-Hermitian, so X is not Hermitian. Therefore, X cannot represent an observable. So option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

Now, check Z. Z is given as:

Z = [
[3, 2i, 5],
[-2i, -2, -4i],
[5, 4i, 4]
]

Let's compute Z†, which is the conjugate transpose.

Z† would be:

Take each element (i,j), conjugate it, and place it at (j,i).

Original Z:

Z(1,1)=3; Z(1,2)=2i; Z(1,3)=5.

Z(2,1)= -2i; Z(2,2)= -2; Z(2,3)= -4i.

Z(3,1)=5; Z(3,2)=4i; Z(3,3)=4.

So Z† would have:

Z†(1,1)=3*, which is 3.

Z†(1,2)= Z(2,1)* → (-2i)*= 2i.

Z†(1,3)= Z(3,1)* →5* =5.

Z†(2,1)= Z(1,2)* → (2i)*= -2i.

Z†(2,2)= -2 → same.

Z†(2,3)= Z(3,2)* → (4i)*= -4i.

Z†(3,1)= Z(1,3)* →5* =5.

Z†(3,2)= Z(2,3)* → (-4i)*=4i.

Z†(3,3)=4 → same.

So Z† is:

Row 1: 3, 2i, 5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row 3:5,4i,4

Wait, that's the same as the original Z matrix. So Z† equals Z. Therefore, Z is Hermitian. So Z is an observable. But X is not Hermitian. Therefore, option C says Z and X are observables. Since X is not, option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, W is given as:

W = [
[0, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 0]
]

Let me compute W† W and see if it's the identity matrix.

W is a real matrix and symmetric, so W† = W^T.

W^T is same as W because it's symmetric. So W† = W.

Then W† W = W^2.

Let me compute W squared.

W^2 = W * W.

Compute each element:

First row:

(W first row) [0,0,1] multiplied by each column of W.

Column 1: 0*0 + 0*0 +1*1 =1.

Column 2: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0.

Column3:0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0.

So row 1: [1,0,0].

Row 2:

W row 2: [0,1,0].

Multiply by W columns:

Col1: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0.

Col2:0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

Col3:0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

Row2: [0,1,0].

Row3:

W row3: [1,0,0].

Multiply by W columns:

Col1:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0.

Col2:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.

Col3:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

Row3: [0,0,1].

So W squared is:
[1 0 0;
 0 1 0;
 0 0 1]
Which is the identity matrix.

So W† W = I. Therefore, W is unitary. So W is a valid evolution operator.

Now, check X. X is skew-Hermitian, as earlier established. So e^X is unitary, but X itself is not unitary. Because for a unitary matrix U, U† U = I. X is skew-Hermitian, so X† = -X.

Let me compute X† X.

X† is -X, so X† X = (-X) X = -X^2.

Compute X^2.

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i.

Row2:1, 0,1.

Row3: 2i, -1, -i.

Compute X*X:

Each row multiplied by each column.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute element (1,1):

Row1 of X: (i, -1, 2i) multiplied by column1: (i, 1, 2i).

So i * i + (-1)*1 + 2i * 2i.

Compute each term:

i*i = i² = -1.

(-1)*1 = -1.

2i *2i=4i²=4*(-1)= -4.

So sum: (-1) + (-1) + (-4) = -6.

Element (1,1)= -6.

Element (1,2):

Row1 * column2:

i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + 2i*(-1).

= -i + 0 -2i = -3i.

Element (1,3):

Row1 * column3:

i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + 2i*(-i).

= 2i² + (-1) + (-2i²).

= 2*(-1) + (-1) + (-2*(-1)).

= -2 -1 +2 = -1.

Similarly, proceed for other elements. Wait, perhaps a quicker way is to compute X^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that X is skew-Hermitian, so X† = -X. Thus, X is anti-Hermitian. Also, for any square matrix, (X†) (X) = (-X) X = -X².

Now, for X to be unitary, X† X must equal I. But X† X = -X².

So if X is unitary, then X† X = I → -X² = I → X² = -I.

But let's compute X² and see.

Compute X²:

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i.

Row2:1, 0,1.

Row3: 2i, -1, -i.

Compute X squared:

Element (1,1):

(i)(i) + (-1)(1) + (2i)(2i) → i² = -1; (-1)(1)=-1; (2i)(2i)=4i²= -4. So sum: (-1) + (-1) + (-4) = -6.

Element (1,2):

(i)(-1) + (-1)(0) + (2i)(-1) → -i + 0 -2i = -3i.

Element (1,3):

(i)(2i) + (-1)(1) + (2i)(-i) → (2i²)= (-2) + (-1) + (-2i²) = (-2) + (-1) + 2 → (-3) +2 = -1.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more carefully.

Element (1,3) of X² is sum over k of X(1,k)*X(k,3).

So X(1,1)*X(1,3) + X(1,2)*X(2,3) + X(1,3)*X(3,3).

Which is (i)(2i) + (-1)(1) + (2i)(-i).

Compute each term:

i *2i = 2i² = -2.

-1 *1 = -1.

2i * (-i) = -2i² = 2.

So sum: (-2) + (-1) + 2 = (-3) +2 = -1.

Similarly, other elements may take time, but perhaps I can see a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps X^2 is not equal to -I, so X is not unitary.

Wait, let's compute X's square. Alternatively, perhaps X is not unitary, because X is skew-Hermitian (so e^X is unitary), but X itself is not unitary.

So for option D, it says W and X are evolution operators. Since X is not unitary, it can't be an evolution operator. So option D is incorrect.

Putting it all together:

Option A: Incorrect because e^X is unitary; multiplying by e^X doesn't change vector norm.

Option B: Correct because e^X Y e^{-X} is a density matrix.

Option C: Incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

Option D: Incorrect because X is not unitary.

So the correct statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct statement about the given matrices, we analyze each option based on the properties of the matrices and their transformations.

### Option A:
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which multiplying by \( e^X \) changes the norm. For this to be true, \( e^X \) must not preserve the norm. However, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), and the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Unitary matrices preserve the norm of any vector they act upon. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option B:
The statement claims that \( (e^X)^\dagger Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a quantum state. Quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. 

- \( Y \) is a symmetric matrix with real entries, making it Hermitian. Its trace is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \), and its leading principal minors are all positive, indicating it is positive semi-definite. Thus, \( Y \) is a valid density matrix.
- Since \( e^X \) is unitary, the similarity transformation \( (e^X)^\dagger Y (e^{-X}) \) preserves the Hermitian and positive semi-definite properties of \( Y \). Therefore, the transformed matrix is also a valid density matrix, representing a quantum state. This statement is **correct**.

---

### Option C:
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices.

- \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), not Hermitian (\( X^\dagger \neq X \)), so it is not an observable.
- \( Z \) is Hermitian (\( Z^\dagger = Z \)), so it is an observable.
- Since \( X \) is not Hermitian, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option D:
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of some quantum system. The evolution operator must be unitary.

- \( W \) is symmetric and satisfies \( W^\dagger W = W^2 = I \), making it unitary. Thus, \( W \) is a valid evolution operator.
- \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, and while \( e^X \) is unitary, \( X \) itself is not unitary. Therefore, \( X \) cannot represent the evolution operator. This statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Conclusion:
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X)^\dagger Y (e^{-X}) \) is a valid density matrix representing a quantum state.

**Answer: B**
