Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, I think that's a typo or maybe a misinterpretation. Maybe the interaction term is more like L = λ X ψ ψ, so the boson X couples to a fermion ψ with some coupling constant λ. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means the energy has to be enough to produce the particles. So the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into, right? Because you need energy to create two particles each with their rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait—fermions come in different types with different masses. So X can decay into a pair of fermions if the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let me think about the possible fermion pairs.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. Quarks come in up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But wait, in the Lagrangian, is X coupling to all possible fermions or just specific ones? Oh, the problem says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, which looks like it's a Yukawa coupling. So X is coupling to fermions f with some coupling strength. So any fermion f would be allowed as long as the Lagrangian term exists for them. But wait, perhaps in the problem, X can interact with any fermion, so any fermion pair could be produced, but only if kinematically allowed.

Wait, but the options given have specific decay channels. So I need to find which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the possible fermion pairs and their masses:

- b quark: mass around 4.7 GeV. So two b quarks would be 9.4 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, which is less. So decay into b b̄ is not allowed kinematically. So any option with b b̄ is wrong. Looking at the options, option A and D have b b̄. So they can't be correct.

Wait, wait, let me check. The mass of X is 6 GeV. To decay into two particles, each with mass m, the condition is 2m ≤ MX. So for b quark, 4.7 *2=9.4>6, so decay into b b̄ is not allowed. So any option with b b̄ is wrong. So options A and D can be eliminated.

Next, what about c quarks? The c quark is about 1.27 GeV. 2 *1.27=2.54≤6. So decay into c c̄ is allowed. So options that include c c̄ are possible. Looking at the options, option B includes c c̄ and others, and option C also includes c c̄.

What about other quarks? Let's see: up quark is like 2 MeV, down and strange are a bit heavier, maybe 4-5 MeV for down, 100 MeV for strange. So u and d quarks are very light; their pairs would have negligible mass. So X can decay into u ū, d d̄, s s̄, etc. 2m for s is about 200 MeV, so that's okay. So any quark pair with mass less than 3 GeV would be allowed.

Wait, but let's get the exact masses. Let me list approximate masses:

Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
Down: ~4.7 MeV
Strange: ~100 MeV
Charm: ~1.27 GeV
Bottom: ~4.7 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

Leptons:

Electron: ~0.511 MeV
Muon: ~105.7 MeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Neutrinos are negligible.

So fermion pairs that can come from X decay (6 GeV mass):

- quark pairs:
u ū: 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV → allowed
d d̄: 2 *5 MeV = 10 MeV → allowed
s s̄: 2 * 100 MeV = 200 MeV → allowed
c c̄: 2 * 1.27 GeV = 2.54 GeV → allowed
t t̄: 2 * 173 GeV = way above 6 GeV → not allowed
b b̄: 2*4.7=9.4 GeV → not allowed.

So quarks allowed are u, d, s, c, but not t or b.

Lepton pairs:

e+ e−: 2 * 0.511 MeV → allowed
mu+ mu−: 2 * 105 MeV = 210 MeV → allowed
tau+ tau−: 2 * 1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV → allowed.

So X can decay into any of these: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, e. But it includes b which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. So that includes all the allowed quarks and leptons except top, bottom. So B is possible.

Option C: Also includes t t̄, which isn't allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: Includes b, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian: in the problem statement, the interaction term is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X couples to fermions f. So does this mean that X can interact with any fermion f, or only specific ones? The problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", which suggests that X couples to any fermion. So any fermion f can participate in the decay.

So the possible decay products are all fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is ≤6 GeV.

So the allowed decay channels are:

u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Which matches option B and option D? Wait no. Let me look at the options.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. So all allowed.

Option D: has b b̄. So it's wrong.

Wait, but in the options, option B includes c c̄, which is allowed, and others.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the options again.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

That's all the allowed decay channels. So option B includes all correct except for t and b which are too heavy.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total energy of the decay products (twice the fermion mass) must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed kinematically. Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Contains \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed kinematically. Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed kinematically. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
