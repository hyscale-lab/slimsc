Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction.

The question says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. When you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid will change. Let me calculate that.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, that makes sense. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So I need to find the pH at that point.

The solution after 25% titration will be a buffer solution, a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

But wait, let's get the moles. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol neutralized by NaOH. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at this point? The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, and during titration, 25% of the required NaOH volume is added. Let me find the equivalence point volume first to get how much NaOH is needed in total.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume at equivalence is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³.

Wait, but during the 25% titration, only 25% of this 10 cm³ is added. 25% of 10 is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

Now, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate. Let's compute:

Molarity of acetic acid: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

Molarity of acetate: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. I know that log(2e-5)=4.7, and since 1.85 is close to 2, maybe around 4.73 or something.

Wait, let me calculate. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5= -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

So using the Henderson equation: pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but I should check the equivalence point pH. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will be a basic solution.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

To find pH, we can find pOH first. Let's calculate [OH-].

The concentration of acetate is moles / volume. At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So for the hydrolysis reaction, the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, [OH-] ≈ x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514, which is about 8.51 or 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is about 8.52.

Looking back, the first part gave me pH ≈4.26. So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26; equivalence is 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the answer should be option A.

Wait but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the dilution steps.

Wait in the initial step, the diluted solution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M) for 25% titration.

Wait, no, the 25% is based on the volume needed for equivalence. So when I added 2.5 cm³, that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the ratio at 25% without considering the dilution. Hmm, wait, the initial moles are 0.001. 25% neutralized is 0.00025. So the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be same.

Wait, another thing: sometimes, when you dilute a solution, the pH changes. But in this case, when we diluted the acetic acid, it's a weak acid, so it's not as straightforward as a strong acid.

Wait, let me think about the initial pH after dilution. The initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. The pH can be calculated using the formula for weak acids:

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] ≈ [H+]² / (0.025 - [H+]) ≈ [H+]² / 0.025

So [H+]² ≈ Ka * 0.025 = 1.85e-5 * 0.025 = 4.625e-7 → [H+] ≈ 6.8e-4 → pH ≈ 3.17.

Wait, but that's the initial pH after dilution. But when we start titrating, the solution becomes a buffer. So perhaps my initial calculation is correct.

Wait, but when I added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the concentrations change. Let me re-calculate the buffer concentrations.

Moles of acetic acid before titration: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added in 25%: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid now: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume after adding 2.5 cm³: 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is -0.477.

Henderson equation: pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26.

So that's correct. So the first part is 4.26.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.05 L of 0.02 M acetate. So Kb is 5.405e-10, as I calculated earlier. [OH-] ≈ sqrt( (5.405e-10)*0.02 ) → sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6.

pOH is about 5.486 → pH is 8.514, so 8.51 or 8.52.

Thus, the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the equivalence point calculation?

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point: the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is about 5.4e-10.

So Kb = [OH-]^2 / (0.02 - [OH-]) ≈ [OH-]^2 /0.02.

So [OH-]^2 = Kb *0.02 =5.4e-10 *0.02 =1.08e-11 → [OH-] = sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 → pOH ≈5.486 → pH≈ 8.514.

Yes, that's correct. So equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

So option A is correct.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, there are 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, 25% of this corresponds to:

\[
\text{Moles neutralized} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Thus, the remaining moles of acetic acid (HA) are:

\[
\text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate ions (A⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of A⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of HA and A⁻ are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A⁻}]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Therefore:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions (A⁻). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{A⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{HA} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( \text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).

Using the approximation \( [\text{OH⁻}]^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A⁻}] \):

\[
[\text{OH⁻}]^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 \approx 8.514 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
