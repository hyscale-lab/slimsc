Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. So, when a molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical activity. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. If that's the case, the compound can have enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.

The question gives four different moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, and I need to figure out which are correct.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
Okay, so this sounds a bit complex. Let's break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. The groups are nitro and carboxylate esters.

Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. But wait, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (2 and 6), but are they in the same or opposite positions on the biphenyl?

Well, in biphenyls, the substituents can be in a para or ortho relationship depending on how the rings are connected. But for optical isomerism, the molecule needs a plane of symmetry? Or wait, no— optical isomerism arises when the molecule has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry, like in allenes or some other structures.

Wait, but in biphenyls, the substituents can lead to cis or trans arrangements, which can contribute to stereoisomerism. Oh wait, but biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless it's a fused ring, that's not the case. Alternatively, if the substituents create a chiral center.

Wait, in this case, each ring has substituents. So the biphenyl has two substituents on each ring. Let me imagine the structure.

The main chain is a biphenyl, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each benzene ring has two substituents: at position 2 and 6. For each ring, the substituents are a nitro group and a carboxylate ester.

Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. So, for each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the point where the two benzene rings are connected (since biphenyl is [1,1'], so the rings are connected at position 1 of each benzene). So in each ring, positions 2 and 6 are next to the point of connection.

Wait, the substituents on each ring are nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So on each benzene ring, they're positioned across from each other? Let me draw a benzene ring. Position 1 is where the biphenyl connects. Then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to 1. So 2 is at one side, 6 at the opposite. So the substituents on each ring are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). So for each ring, the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the nitro and carboxylate groups are on adjacent carbons. So each ring has two substituents in the ortho positions relative to the point of connection.

But do these substituents create any chiral centers? Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are themselves planar. So unless there's a chiral center in the substituent group, the molecule may not have optical isomerism.

Wait, the substituents are nitro groups (NO2) and ester groups (OOCR). Are those attached to the benzene rings via their own chiral centers?

Wait, the ester groups are O-CO-OCH3. The carboxylate is from a carboxylic acid ester. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the ring. So the ester oxygen is attached to the ring. In that case, the ester group is a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen connected to the ring. So the ring is connected to O-CO-OCH3.

So the substituent is a group like OOCR, which might be a planar group. So the substituents on each ring are O-CO-OCH3 and NO2. Are any of these groups themselves chiral?

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The oxygen is connected to the ring, then a carbonyl, then an OCH3. So the carbonyl is a double bond, so it's trigonal planar. The ester group is symmetrical in a way, so I don't think it creates a chiral center.

So if the substituents on each benzene ring are O-CO-OCH3 and NO2, and they're each on adjacent positions, then could the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, the two benzene rings each have substituents at positions 2 and 6. So in the case of the biphenyl, the two substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester.

Wait, the molecule is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the rings are connected at position 1 of each. So substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the point of connection. So each ring has substituents on positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to the connection.

Now, the question is whether this structure has any chiral centers or if the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Wait, the molecule is dimethyl, meaning the ester groups are OCH3 on both sides.

Wait, so each substituent on the ring is O-CO-OCH3 (carboxylate ester) and NO2. Are any of these groups themselves attached to a chiral center? Let's see— the ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbonyl is between the oxygen and the ester oxygen. The OCH3 is a methyl ester. The central carbon in the ester group is the carbon from the carboxylic acid. Wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. So the actual structure is O connected to the ring, then a carbonyl (C=O), then an oxygen connected to a methyl group.

Wait, the substituent is a group like O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring is connected to this group.

So each substituent on the benzene is either NO2 or O-CO-OCH3.

Do either of these groups introduce a chiral center? Let me think. The O-CO-OCH3 group is attached via the oxygen to the ring. The central carbon in the ester group is the one from the original carboxylic acid. Wait, but the ester is O-CO-OCH3. So the carbonyl group is between the oxygen and the ester oxygen. So the structure is O–C(=O)–OCH3.

In this structure, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's trigonal planar. The adjacent oxygen is connected to the methyl group. So the carbonyl carbon doesn't have four different groups attached to it. The groups are: the ring (through the oxygen), the two oxygen atoms (double bond and single), and the OCH3. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is attached to O (from the ring), O (from the ester), and two other oxygens? No, wait, the structure is O–C(=O)–OCH3. So the carbonyl is C=O, and then the other side is O–OCH3.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to the ring (through the oxygen), the oxygen (double bond), another oxygen (single bond to OCH3), and that's it. So the carbonyl carbon has three bonds: one to the ring via O, two to oxygen (one double, one single). So that's three groups. So wait, actually, the carbonyl group is part of the substituent, but the substituent doesn't have a chiral center, as the carbonyl is trigonal planar.

So the substituent as a whole is planar, so there's no chiral center from that.

So the main question is: does the molecule as a whole have a plane of symmetry or not?

Wait, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions—2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester.

In the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So on each ring, the substituents are in the same positions—so the nitro and carboxylate are in the same positions on each ring.

But wait, the substituents on each ring are both at 2 and 6. So when you look at the entire biphenyl structure, perhaps the substituents on one ring are in positions that are mirrored on the other.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are opposite each other. So in terms of the overall molecule, would there be any symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents lead to a situation where the molecule is chiral. Let me think. Suppose the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule not symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in positions that make the two rings mirror images, but the arrangement of substituents across the biphenyl axis leads to a chiral structure.

Wait, wait, the molecule has two substituents on each ring. Let me try to visualize: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. The positions on each ring are 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the point of connection (position 1). So the substituents on each ring are on adjacent carbons. So when you look at the molecule, the substituents on each ring are in a certain orientation relative to each other.

But wait, each substituent is on the same side of the ring? Or opposite? Hmm, I don't think that's the case. Because in a benzene ring, substituents can be in different positions.

Wait, if each substituent on each ring is at 2 and 6, then on each ring, the substituents are in the same positions relative to the point of attachment. So perhaps the substituents on the two rings are across from each other.

Wait, perhaps this structure is symmetric. If the rings are connected at position 1, and each has substituents at 2 and 6, which are symmetric across the ring, then perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, which would make it not chiral.

Wait, another approach: think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If you can draw a plane that cuts through the molecule such that each side mirrors the other, then the molecule is achiral and won't exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, for the biphenyl, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that a plane of symmetry exists, then the molecule is achiral. Otherwise, it's chiral and can have enantiomers.

So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. If the substituents are arranged such that they mirror each other across the plane of the biphenyl, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but the substituents are different: one is a nitro group, the other a carboxylate ester. So on each ring, the substituents are different. So the substituents on each ring are not the same. So considering the two rings, each with a nitro and a carboxylate, but the arrangement could lead to a chiral molecule.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric. For example, if each ring has substituents arranged across from each other, such that the molecule as a whole is symmetric.

But since each substituent on each ring is different (nitro and ester), perhaps the arrangement on each ring creates a chiral center.

Wait, no, the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are themselves planar. The substituents themselves are not chiral. Unless the substituent is connected in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. The oxygen is connected to the benzene, then the carbonyl, then another oxygen connected to methyl. So the substituent's structure is O-CO-OCH3.

But the substituent as a whole is a planar group. So the substituent doesn't have any chiral centers.

So the only possibility for the molecule to be chiral is if the two rings are arranged in such a way that their substituents create an overall asymmetry.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl itself has a certain conformation. Biphenyls can have different dihedral angles, but that's about rotation around the single bond. However, unless the substituents are positioned in a way that prevents the molecule from being superimposed on its mirror image, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are both in the same positions but are different groups (nitro and ester), then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Because the substituents on each ring are different, and their arrangement could result in the molecule being chiral.

Hmm. I'm a bit tentative here. But perhaps this molecule does exhibit optical isomerism, making option 1 correct.

Moving on to the second compound.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
So the structure is CH3-O-CO-OHCH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. Its methyl ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is: the ester group is OMe (OCH3) attached to the COO. The propanoate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, wait, maybe it's HOCH2COOCH2CH2-OCH3? No, wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. Propanoate is three carbons: the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, this molecule has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the propane chain.

Wait, the carbon chain is:

COOCH3 is the carboxylate ester. Then, the adjacent carbon is CH2, which has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, with the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Propanoate is -OOCCH2CH3. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the chain is three carbons: the COOCH3 is the first carbon, then the second is CH2, and the third is CH3? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the carboxylic acid is on the end. The propanoate ester would be CH2CH2COOOR. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps. Because the numbering starts from the COO group. So COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbon 1). Then the next carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, and the third (carbon 3) is also CH2, but with a hydroxyl?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me number the propanoate chain.

Propanoate: COOCH3 is carbon 1. Then carbon 2 is CH2, and carbon 3 is CH3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2, which is CH2.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that molecule, the hydroxyl is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group. So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So that's correct. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Looking at the central carbon (the second carbon in the chain), it has four different groups attached.

Wait, let's see: the central carbon is attached to:

- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Two CH2 groups (one towards the COOCH3, one towards the other direction)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, wait, the structure would be:

COOCH3 is the first carbon. Then the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- the COOCH3 group
- another CH2 group (which is attached to the third carbon, which is CH3)
- a hydroxyl group (OH)
- a hydrogen (H).

Wait, no, because if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the structure would be:

COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbonyl group), then the next is a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2, which is attached to the hydroxyl.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me re-express it correctly.

The correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the second carbon in the chain (from COOCH3) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (carbon 1)
- another CH2 (carbon 3)
- an OH group
- a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the carbon chain. The COOCH3 is carbon 1. Carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (COOCH3), and to carbon 3 (CH3). Additionally, carbon 2 has an OH group and a hydrogen.

So, carbon 2 has four groups: COOCH3, CH3 (through carbon 3?), wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 is CH2, so it's connected to carbon 1 (COOCH3), and two CH2 groups? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So carbon 2 is the middle CH2 group. Each CH2 has two hydrogens and two bonds to other groups. Wait, but that would mean the middle carbon is CH2, not a chiral center. Because it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups). Wait, no— wait, in this case, the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- carbon 1 (COOCH3)
- carbon 3 (CH2CH3)
- two hydrogens.

Wait, no, in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH(OH) connected to two CH2 groups. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write out the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The formula is:

(CH2)2COOCH3, where one of the CH2 groups has an OH substituent.

So, the structure is: O
               ||
               O-C-OCH3
               |
               CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think about the IUPAC name. The parent chain is propanoate, which is three carbons. The substituent is hydroxyl on carbon 2.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (carbon 1)
|
CH(OH)-CH2- (carbon 2)
|
CH3 (carbon 3)

Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure would be:

COOCH3 is attached to carbon 1. Carbon 2 has a hydroxyl and is connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3. Carbon 3 is a methyl group.

Wait, so carbon 2 has the following attached:

- COOCH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- CH3 (carbon 3)
- and a hydrogen.

So the four groups on carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. All four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center.

So this molecule has a chiral center, meaning it can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Moving on to the third compound.

3. benzophenone
Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So it's two benzene rings connected to a ketone group (C=O).

The structure is CPh2CO. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings.

Wait, benzophenone structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. The carbonyl is double-bonded to oxygen, so the central carbon only has three bonds: two to phenyl and one to O.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is aryl (phenyl in this case).

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen. So the central carbon has only three substituents.

Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and another substituent? Or perhaps not.

Wait, no, for benzophenone, the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the central carbon has two phenyl groups attached, and a carbonyl group (O double bond). That makes three substituents, so the central carbon is sp² hybridized, with a double bond to oxygen.

Wait, but that would make the central carbon trigonal, not tetrahedral. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center. So, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Fourth compound.

4. dimethyl fumarate
Fumarate is an acid that is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans-dimer, and maleic acid is the cis-dimer. Wait, no, correction: maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans.

Wait, wait, maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, and fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So its structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

No, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Its dimethyl ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, let me draw it correctly. Fumaric acid is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester: O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(O)OCH3? Wait, no, wait. It's actually O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3)? No, that's not right.

Wait, the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3), but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, but wait, fumarate is the trans diacid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, no. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

And the double bond is in the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is:

      O
      ||
      O-C-OCH3
       \
CH2-CH=CH-C-O-C-OCH3

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CO-OCH3

No, no. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is more accurately represented as:

(CH2CH2)COOCH3 with a double bond. Wait, no, correct structure is O

Actually, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the molecule has a double bond between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

Now, does this molecule have any stereoisomerism? Since it's a trans-diestereomer, perhaps it has geometric isomerism. But geometric isomerism is about different spatial arrangements due to double bonds, not optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, can this molecule have optical isomerism? Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes.

Wait, in the case of fumarate dimethyl ester, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. Each carbon of the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and one CH2 group.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate dimethyl ester is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3), but with a double bond between the two middle carbons.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

No, no. Let me get back to the correct structure. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. The dimethyl fumarate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether the molecule has any chiral centers or another form of asymmetry leading to optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two ester groups. So each of those carbons has two ester groups attached. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

       O
       ||
       O-C-OCH3
        \
CH2-CH=CH-C-O-C-OCH3

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The structure is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

The structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2

But the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the butenedioate.

Wait, but in any case, the key point is whether this molecule has any chiral centers. Since it's a diester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-diacid, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because each side is symmetrical. Wait, no, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond.

Wait, in the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond.

Wait, but does that create a chiral center? No, because the molecule is symmetrical. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to two ester groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two ester groups. So each of these carbons has two ester groups and two CH2 groups? No, wait.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, perhaps the two central carbons (in the double bond) each have two ester groups, a CH2 and a CH group.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing myself. Let me think of it as a four-carbon chain. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has two COOCH3 groups attached.

Wait, no, because in that case, each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, which isn't possible as that would imply four substituents on a double-bonded carbon, which is only allowed to have three.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the structure of fumarate. Fumarate is the trans form of maleate, which is a diacid. The diacid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The dimethyl ester would then be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but arranged in the trans configuration.

Wait, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has one COOCH3 group, one CH2 group, one CH group, and another substituent.

Wait, no. Alternatively, each central carbon is connected to two ester groups, a hydrogen, and another carbon.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that each central carbon is connected to two ester groups, a CH2 group, and a CH group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it from another angle: does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

In the molecule, each of the central carbons is part of a double bond. So each has three substituents: two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 or CH group.

Wait, no, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
CH2-C=CH2-CO-OCH3

But with the substituents on opposite sides (trans).

But in that case, each of the central carbons would have two COOCH3 groups, a CH2, and a CH group. Wait, no, because the CH2 and CH are part of the same chain.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two other substituents. But if those are the same, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons is attached to two ester groups and a CH2 group. Wait, that can't be, because that would require four substituents on a double-bonded carbon.

Ah, perhaps each of the two central carbons in the double bond is attached to one ester group, one CH2 group, and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to a CH2 group, a CH group, and two ester groups?

No, no, that's not possible because each double-bonded carbon can have only three substituents. So perhaps each central carbon is attached to a CH2 group, a CH group, and two ester groups. But that's four substituents, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to two ester groups and two other groups. But if each of these carbons is attached to two identical groups (like two ester groups), then they aren't chiral centers.

Wait, no, wait. If each of the central carbons is attached to two ester groups, one CH2 group, and another CH group, then perhaps they are each connected to four different groups. Wait, but they're double-bonded, so each can only have three substituents.

Wait, since it's a double bond, each carbon can only have three substituents. So each carbon in the double bond has:

- one COOCH3 group,
- one CH2 group,
- and another CH group.

Wait, but that would mean each is attached to three different groups plus the double bond. So, that's four substituents, which isn't possible.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. If the molecule is symmetrical, like in the case of a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, the trans configuration would have a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Because if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it's chiral. But if the molecule is symmetrical, it's not chiral.

So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a plane of symmetry: the double bond has substituents on opposite sides, but the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond's axis. So each side mirrors the other.

Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: some diastereomers can be chiral, but in this case, the molecule's symmetry would prevent chirality.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of another example. For example, maleic acid dimethyl ester (cis) would have both ester groups on the same side of the double bond, leading to a chiral molecule because the two substituents (ester groups) are on the same side, making the molecule lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, so each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if you can rotate it 180 degrees and it looks the same, then it's not chiral.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the trans configuration would have each ester group on opposite sides, leading to a situation where the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate — I'm not sure yet. Earlier, I thought it might be chiral, but maybe not.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate — has a chiral center, so yes.

3. benzophenone — no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate — symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought about compound 4 not having optical isomerism because it's symmetrical. But then I thought about the possibility of being a diastereomer, but that's for geometric isomerism, not optical activity.

Now, back to compound 1. Let me think again about it.

The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxyl ester at 2.

Wait, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. So substituents at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the point of connection.

So, each ring has substituents on adjacent carbons, but in a way that creates a mirror image.

Wait, but the substituents are different: one is nitro, the other is ester. So, for each ring, the substituents are nitro and ester on adjacent positions.

Now, could the entire molecule be chiral?

Because the substituents on each ring are different, perhaps the arrangement leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two rings, making it achiral.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that mirrors each other across the plane, then the molecule would be achiral.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about the substituents on each ring. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester group, but in the same positions.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Otherwise, it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecule as being symmetrical. For example, if each ring has substituents that mirror each other across the biphenyl axis, then the molecule is symmetrical. So for instance, the nitro group on one ring is on the same side as the ester group on the other ring.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because the substituents are in different positions relative to the biphenyl axis.

Wait, perhaps each ring has a nitro and an ester in such a way that they are opposite each other on the ring. So, when you look at the biphenyl, each substituent is across from the other.

In that case, the molecule might be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the overall molecule is chiral.

I think I'm stuck on this point. Let me make a note and proceed.

So, putting it all together:

1. I'm uncertain, but perhaps it's chiral.

2. Yes, has a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So the moieties that show optical isomerism are 2, perhaps 1.

Looking back at the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, from the analysis, only 2 shows optical isomerism. But wait, I thought that 1 might, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps 1 does not.

Wait, let me reevaluate 1.

If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and each substituent is a nitro and a carboxylate, the arrangement could be such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that mirrors each other across the biphenyl axis, then the molecule is symmetrical.

But since the substituents are different (nitro and ester), their arrangement might lead to asymmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the same side of each benzene ring. So, for each ring, the nitro and ester are on the same side. Then, when looking at the entire molecule, the arrangement may lack symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to symmetry.

I think without a clear understanding of the arrangement, it's hard to say. But perhaps the correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options don't have an option with only 2.

Looking at the options again:

Option A) 1, 2, 4.

Option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, in the analysis, I thought 2 and perhaps 1 are correct. But based on my earlier confusion, perhaps 1 isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Let me think about whether the molecule in 1 has a plane of symmetry.

If the two substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they are not mirror images, the molecule would be chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, considering that each substituent is at 2 and 6, which are adjacent positions, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that runs through the axis connecting the two rings.

In that case, each substituent is mirrored on the other ring, making the molecule symmetrical and thus achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the configuration is such that they are not mirrored, leading to a lack of symmetry and thus chirality.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are such that they are mirror images. So, if each ring has a nitro group on one side and a carboxylate on the other, arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

But given that the substituents are in the same positions but different groups, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical, making it chiral.

I think I'm stuck, but I'll proceed with the assumption that option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another point: the molecule in option 1 may have a plane of symmetry. For example, the two substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the biphenyl axis. So, for each ring, the nitro and ester are on opposite sides. Thus, the molecule is symmetrical.

If that's the case, then the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, only option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, none of the options have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, but the initial analysis says that only 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with just 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me re-examine it. 

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Earlier, I thought it's symmetrical and doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, no, the central carbons are double-bonded, so no chiral centers there. So it can't have optical isomerism.

So, if only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

If compound 1 has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl group in 1 leads to a situation where the molecule is chiral.

Wait, another point: the biphenyl structure with substituents in certain positions can lead to a chiral molecule. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, then the molecule is chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in the same positions. So the substituents are in the same positions on each ring but are different groups.

So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a chiral environment.

I'm still uncertain. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and 3

D)1 and 2

If I thought that only 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options have that, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 is chiral.

Wait, considering that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are in positions that would lead to the molecule being chiral if the substituents are not symmetrical.

If the substituents on each ring are not arranged in a symmetrical way, then the molecule would be chiral.

So, perhaps the molecule in 1 is chiral, leading to optical isomerism. Then, 2 is also chiral.

Thus, the correct options would be 1 and 2, which is option D.

Wait, but why would compound 1 be chiral?

Because the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule not symmetrical. For example, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their arrangement relative to each other may create a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D (1 and 2).


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has a plane of symmetry and lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group (NO₂) and a carboxylate ester group (O-CO-OCH₃). The substituents are in the same positions on each ring but are different functional groups. The arrangement of these substituents creates asymmetry in the molecule, as there is no plane of symmetry. Therefore, this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon in the chain is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl (CH₃), an ester group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (H). The presence of a chiral center means this molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has two identical phenyl groups attached. Since there are no chiral centers and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides (trans configuration). The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, meaning it has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.  
- Compound 2 is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.  
- Compound 3 is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
- Compound 4 is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

Thus, the correct answer is **1 and 2**.

**Answer: D**
