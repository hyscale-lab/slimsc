Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, spots are making the star cooler overall. 

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels has a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in LTE, so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, right. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

So, when the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when it has spots, it's 5500 K. The ratio n1/n2 in the presence of spots is lower. So, when the star is hotter, the ratio is higher, and when it's cooler, the ratio is lower. That makes sense because higher temperature means more thermal energy, so atoms are more likely to be in higher energy states, leading to a lower ratio of lower to higher levels.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it's at 6000 K. So the ratio when no spots (T=6000) is higher than when spots are present (T=5500).

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Using the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, actually, the equation is usually written as n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), depending on how you define it. So I have to be careful with the setup.

Wait, the energy levels: the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one? Or the other way around? The wavelength is given, which corresponds to the energy difference. Let me think, higher energy photons come from higher to lower levels. So if the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet, the energy is E = hc/λ.

But perhaps I don't need the exact energy values because I can work with the ratio of the ratios.

So, the ratio when no spots (T1 = 6000 K) compared to when spots are present (T2 =5500 K) is:

Ratio_factor = (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 )

Substituting the Boltzmann equation:

(n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out. So:

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )
= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] )

Wait, let me compute that exponent:

= ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Wait, no: Wait, it's [ ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) + (ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Which is ΔE/(k) [ ( -1/T1 ) + (1/T2) ) ]

Which is ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

So the exponent is positive if 1/T2 > 1/T1, which is true because T2 < T1. So 1/5500 > 1/6000.

So the exponent is positive, meaning the ratio factor is greater than 1. Which makes sense because when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so n1/n2 increases. So the ratio (no spots)/(spots) is a number greater than 1.

But wait, the numbers in the problem: the ratio decreases when spots are present. So (n1/n2)_no spots > (n1/n2)_with spots. So the factor is (no spots ratio)/(with spots ratio) = some number greater than 1.

I need to calculate this factor.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

At T1 =6000 K, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

At T2=5500 K, same but T=T2.

So the factor is [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, actually, let me re-examine.

Wait, the n1/n2 ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming level 1 is lower than level 2. Because if level 2 is higher, then the transition from 2 to 1 emits a photon.

Wait, let me get that right. If we're looking at the ratio of level 1 to level 2, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Assuming E2 > E1, so E1-E2 is negative. So the exponent is positive, so n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, better to define ΔE = E2 - E1. So we have:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) )

So the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

Because:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So that's the exponent.

But what's the value of ΔE/(k)? Because ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, which is hc/λ.

Wait, because the transition corresponds to wavelength λ, so ΔE = hc/λ.

So, let's compute that. Let me plug in the numbers.

h is Planck's constant: approx 6.626e-34 J s.

c is speed of light: ~3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = h c / λ = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Let me compute that:

First, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but we'll need this in terms of k*T. Because we have k in J/K.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, let's compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approximately 99333 K.

Wait, 1.372e-18 divided by 1.38e-23 is (1.372/1.38) * 1e5. Let me compute 1.372 / 1.38.

1.372 / 1.38 ≈ 0.9942. So 0.9942 * 1e5 = ~99,420 K.

So approximately 99,420 K.

So now, the exponent is (99,420 K) * (1/(5500) - 1/6000) [unit-wise, K * (1/K) ) → dimensionless, which is correct for exponent.]

Compute the term in parentheses:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151

So, 99,420 K * 0.000015151 ≈ Let's compute that.

99,420 * 0.000015151 = let's see.

First, 0.000015151 is about 1.5151e-5.

So 99,420 * 1.5151e-5 = approx 99,420 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 99,420 * 1.5151e-5.

Let me find 99,420 * 1.5151e-5:

99,420 * 0.000015151 = approximately.

Let me compute 99420 * 0.000015151.

Well, 99420 * 0.00001 is 0.9942.

99420 * 0.000005151 = Let's compute.

0.000005151 is about 5.151e-6.

99420 * 5.151e-6 = approx (99420 *5.151) / 1e6.

99420 *5 = 497,100.

99420 * 0.151 = about 15,000 (exactly, 99420 *0.1=9942, 0.05=4971, 0.001=99.42 → sum is 9942+4971=14913+99.42≈15012.42 )

So total 497100 + 15012.42 ≈ 512,112.42.

Divide by 1e6: 0.51211242.

So total exponent is 0.9942 + 0.51211242 ≈ 1.5063.

Wait, wait, no. Oh! Wait, no, I think I messed up the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the exponent is 99,420 K * 0.000015151 ≈ 99,420 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99,420 * 0.000015151.

0.000015151 is 1.5151e-5.

Multiply 99,420 * 1.5151e-5.

99,420 * 1.5151e-5 = (99,420 * 1.5151) * 1e-5.

Compute 99,420 * 1.5151.

Hmm, 99,420 * 1 = 99,420.

99,420 * 0.5 = 49,710.

99,420 * 0.0151 = approx 99,420 *0.01 = 994.2, 99,420 *0.0051=506.042. So 994.2 +506.042≈1,500.242.

Adding all parts: 99,420 +49,710=149,130 +1,500.242≈150,630.242.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,630.242 * 1e-5=15.0630242.

So the exponent is approximately 15.06.

So the factor is exp(15.06). Wait, exp(15) is about 3.269 million. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, 15 is a lot. Let me think.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1.372e-18 J per photon, divided by k (1.38e-23 J/K) gives about 99,420 K.

Then 99,420 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Wait, 1/5500 is ~1.818e-4, 1/6000 ~1.6667e-4. The difference is about 1.515e-5.

So 99420 * 1.515e-5 = approximately 1.506.

Wait, wait, 99,420 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 99,420 * 1.515e-5.

99,420 *1.515e-5 = (99,420) * (1.515) * 1e-5.

Wait, 99,420 *1.515 = let's do that.

99,420 *1 =99,420.

99,420 *0.5 =49,710.

99,420 *0.015=1,491.3.

Adding: 99,420 +49,710=149,130 +1,491.3=150,621.3.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,621.3 *1e-5=15.06213.

So the exponent is 15.06213.

So the factor is exp(15.06213). Wait, what's exp(15)?

I remember that ln(2) is about 0.693, so ln(10)≈2.3026.

So 15 is about 15/2.3026 ≈6.515 ln(10). So 10^6.515 is about 3.26e6. Wait, but wait, no, that's for ln(10^6.515) =6.515 ln(10)=15.

Wait, so exp(15)=e^15 ≈ 3,269,017. So around ~3.27 million.

Wait, but that's a huge factor, which doesn't match any of the options given. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the setup. Because the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because the denominator is smaller, so the exponential becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases when T decreases, but the problem says the ratio decreases. Oh wait, that's contradictory. Hmm, perhaps I have the levels reversed.

Wait, maybe I got the levels wrong. Let me think again.

If the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star cools, that would mean that as T decreases, n1/n2 becomes smaller. So, at lower T, n1/n2 is smaller.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if E2 is higher than E1, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, if E2>E1 (so ΔE positive), as T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 decreases. Wait, so when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So when the star is hotter (no spots), n1/n2 is lower than when it's cooler (with spots), which would make the ratio with spots higher. But that contradicts the problem statement which says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, maybe I have the levels reversed. Suppose level 2 is lower than level 1. No, that can't be because the transition is from a higher to lower energy level (emission), so E2 > E1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-derive it.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the population ratio of two energy levels is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

So, if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive.

So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponential becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So n1/n2 increases.

So, when the star is hotter, n1 is more populated relative to n2, so the ratio n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases (with spots), n1/n2 decreases. But according to the equation, when T decreases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) increases because the denominator k T is smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 should increase when T decreases, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm. That suggests that perhaps I have the levels reversed. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would mean E1 < E2. So, if the star is hotter, more excitation, so more in higher levels. So n2 increases, n1 decreases, so n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, let me re-examine the setup. The problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Then, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.

If the ratio n1/n2 is lower when T is lower, that implies that as T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. Let me see what that would mean in the Boltzmann equation.

If n1 is a lower energy level and n2 is higher, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, E1 is lower than E2, so E1 - E2 is negative. So -(E1 - E2) is positive. So the exponent is positive, exp( positive number ), which is greater than 1. So as T increases, the denominator k T increases, so the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller. So for the same ΔE, as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, but since it's in the exponent positive, so the whole term would decrease as T increases. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ratio when the star is hotter versus cooler.

Wait, no. Let me think of this: if the ratio n1/n2 is higher when the star is hotter, then when the star is cooler, the ratio is lower. But the problem says that when the star is cooler (has spots), the ratio is lower, so that's the case. So in this case, my initial approach was correct, and the factor is exp(15), which is way too big. But the options don't have such a high number. So something's definitely wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE/(k). Let me re-calculate that.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by λ=1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Now, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) = (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 = 99,400 K.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used the same ΔE for both temperatures, but I think that's correct because the energy difference between the levels is fixed for the atom.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is in the way I computed the exponent. Let me re-examine the exponent.

The factor is the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.

I have:

(n1/n2)_T1 = (g1/g2) exp( - ΔE/(k T1) )

(n1/n2)_T2 = (g1/g2) exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which is exp( (99,420 K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, 1/5500 is approx 0.000181818, 1/6000 is approx 0.000166667. The difference is about 0.00001515.

So 99,420 * 0.00001515 ≈ let's compute that.

99,420 * 0.00001515 = 99,420 * 1.515e-5.

Wait, 99,420 * 1.515e-5 = 99,420 * 0.00001515.

Let me compute 99,420 * 0.00001515:

First, 99,420 * 0.00001 = 0.9942.

99,420 * 0.00000515 = let's compute 99,420 * 0.000005 = 0.4971, and 99,420 *0.00000015=0.014913.

Adding these: 0.4971 + 0.014913 = 0.512013.

So total is 0.9942 + 0.512013 ≈ 1.506213.

So the exponent is 15.062 (since 1.506e1 is 15.062? Wait, no, wait: 99,420*(1.515e-5) is 1.506, not 15.06. Because 1.515e-5 is 0.00001515. Oh wait, no, wait, 99,420 *0.00001515 = 1.506213.

Wait, no, 99,420 * 0.00001515 = (99,420 * 1.515) * 1e-5.

Wait, 99,420 * 1.515 = let's compute:

99,420 * 1 =99,420.

99,420 * 0.5 =49,710.

99,420 *0.015=1,491.3.

Adding these: 99,420 +49,710=149,130 +1,491.3=150,621.3.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,621.3 *1e-5=15.06213.

Wait, so exponent is 15.06, so factor is exp(15.06) ≈ 3,270,000.

But the options given are all less than 10. So there's something wrong here. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the transition wavelength is 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV, but maybe the energy difference is not hc/lambda but hc/(lambda) multiplied by some factor, like maybe the ionization energy or something else? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the inverse of the temperature in the exponent? Because sometimes in thermal emission, you have terms like 1/(k T). But no, my setup seems correct.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the line strengths, not the level populations. But no, the question says the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels, so it's about level populations, which is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, perhaps the effect is not directly from the temperature change in the photosphere, but because the spots are cooler regions. But the problem says the overall Teff decreases, so the photosphere is considered as a blackbody with this lower Teff.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the change in the ratio, but level 1 and level 2 might not be the same for all parts of the star. Oh, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region emits according to its local T.

Wait, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But perhaps the T in the spot areas is lower, and the rest is the original 6000 K. But that complicates things because the observed ratio would be a mixture of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. But that's not physically accurate, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, we can proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature, but it's unclear.

Wait, but the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's total flux is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the effective temperature is a measure of the total flux. The flux from a blackbody is sigma*T^4.

So the total flux is F_total = F_spots * (area_fraction) + F_unspotted * (area_fraction).

Wait, area_fraction_spot = 0.4, area_fraction_unspot =0.6.

So F_total = 0.4 * sigma T_spot^4 + 0.6 * sigma T_unspot^4.

But the effective temperature when spots are present is T_eff =5500 K, so F_total = sigma (5500)^4.

Similarly, when there are no spots, F_total = sigma (6000)^4.

So, we can write:

sigma (5500)^4 = 0.4 sigma T_spot^4 + 0.6 sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, but we have two unknowns here: T_spot and T_unspot. Wait, but when spots are present, the unspotted regions are the same as when no spots are present, right? So perhaps when spots are present, the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at T_spot.

So let me write the equation:

sigma (5500)^4 = 0.4 sigma T_spot^4 + 0.6 sigma (6000)^4.

We can divide both sides by sigma to get:

(5500)^4 = 0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 (6000)^4.

Let's compute the terms.

Compute (5500)^4: 5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4= (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

Compute (6000)^4: (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16.

Multiply by 0.6: 0.6 * 1.296e16 = 7.776e15.

So, 5500^4 = 9.150625e14 = 0.4 T_spot^4 + 7.776e15.

Wait, that can't be right because 7.776e15 is much larger than 9.15e14. Let me compute:

Wait, 5500^4 is (5.5e3)^4.

Wait, 5.5^4 is (5.5)^2 squared. 5.5^2=30.25. 30.25^2=915.0625. So 5.5^4=915.0625. So 5500^4= (5.5e3)^4 = (915.0625) * (1e3)^4= 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4= (6^4) * (1e3)^4= 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So putting it all together:

9.150625e14 = 0.4 T_spot^4 + 7.776e14.

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14 = 0.4 T_spot^4.

Divide both sides by 0.4:

T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Compute 3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = (1e3.5)^ (2) ) → Let me compute:

1e14 = (1e3.5)^4 → 1e3.5 is about 3.16e3.

Wait, alternatively, (1e3)^4=1e12, so 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4.

Wait, 3.4365625e14 ≈ 3.43656e14.

Compute the fourth root: (3.43656e14)^(1/4) ≈ ?

Take logs:

ln(3.43656e14) = ln(3.43656) + ln(1e14) ≈ 1.235 + 32.236 ≈ 33.471.

Divide by 4: 33.471 /4 ≈8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^8.3678 ≈ let's see.

e^8 is 2980.911. e^0.3678≈1.445. So 2980.911 *1.445≈4300 K.

So T_spot≈4300 K.

But wait, that's the temperature of the spotted regions.

But how does that relate to the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere? Because the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4300 K.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels across the entire photosphere when spots are present. But since the photosphere is a mix of 40% 4300 K and 6000 K regions, the overall ratio would be an average.

But wait, the problem says the photosphere is in LTE. So perhaps each region (spot and unspot) is in LTE, and the observed line ratio is a flux-weighted average. But that complicates things because the line strength depends on the number of atoms in each level, which depends on the temperature.

Wait, but the question states, "in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio is measured as the overall ratio across the entire photosphere when spots are present. So it's a mix of the two regions.

But how would that average affect the ratio? Because each region contributes its own ratio, weighted by emission.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Because the flux from each region depends on their effective temperatures, which affects the line emission.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is oversimplified, and the change in the overall effective temperature is what determines the change in the ratio. So perhaps the entire photosphere is treated as being at T=5500 K when spots are present, and T=6000 K otherwise.

In that case, I can proceed with the earlier approach, but I must have made a mistake because the factor comes out way too high.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio in terms of the temperature ratio. Let me think again.

The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T changes, the ratio changes by a factor of exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the ratio as (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is the same as before, giving a factor of exp(15.06) ≈ 3.27e6. But that's way too big, and the options don't have anything like that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE/(k). Let me recheck.

ΔE = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc =6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 /1.38e-23 = (1.372 /1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 = ~99,400 K.

So that's correct.

Wait, so the exponent is 99,400 * (1/5500 -1/6000) = 99,400 * [ (6000 -5500) / (5500*6000) ) ]

Wait, that's another way to compute the difference. Let me compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Which is (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000).

So 99,400 * (1/66,000) = 99,400 / 66,000 ≈ 1.506.

So exponent is 1.506, so factor is exp(1.506) ≈4.51.

Ah! Wait, because 1/5500 -1/6000 = 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 1/66,000.

So 99,400 * (1/66,000) )= 99,400 /66,000 ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is 1.506.

So exp(1.506) ≈4.51. Which is option C) ~4.5.

That would make sense. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, that's a much more reasonable answer and matches one of the options.

So, the initial mistake was in calculating the exponent as 15 instead of 1.5 because I forgot to account for the denominator properly.

So the correct factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes when the star transitions from no spots (\( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (\( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)) is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,420 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The temperature difference term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \text{so } \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,420 \cdot 0.00001515 \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
