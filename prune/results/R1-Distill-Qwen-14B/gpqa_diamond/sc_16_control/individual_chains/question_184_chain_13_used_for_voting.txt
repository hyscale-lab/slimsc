Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give the desired product in high yield.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me imagine the benzene ring. The substituents are:

- tert-butyl group at position 2.
- Ethoxy group at position 1.
- Nitro group at position 3.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering is based on substituents. Let me think about the numbering. If the ethoxy is at position 1, then the tert-butyl is at 2 (next to it), and nitro at position 3 (across from ethoxy? Or adjacent to tert-butyl? Wait, let me think about the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a certain order.

Wait, perhaps I should number them so that the substituents are in the correct positions. Let me assign positions 1, 2, 3 in a way that they are adjacent or opposite. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the substituents' positions relative to each other. So, in the target molecule:

- The ethoxy is at position 1.

- The tert-butyl is at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

- The nitro is at position 3 (meta to ethoxy, para to tert-butyl? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps drawing it helps. Let me imagine the benzene ring with three substituents. Let's say the ethoxy is in position 1. Then position 2 is next to it, which is where the tert-butyl is. Position 3 is next to 2, meaning that the nitro is at position 3. So, the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So they are adjacent, in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, the molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is such that the ethoxy is position 1, the tert-butyl is position 2, and nitro is position3. So, adjacent to each other.

Now, the question is about the order of reactions to introduce these substituents. Since benzene is the starting material, we need to perform substitution reactions, probably using electrophilic substitution.

Electrophilic substitution requires activating groups. Benzene itself is not very reactive, so we might need to introduce groups that can activate the ring, directing incoming electrophiles to specific positions.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, while ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via the OCH2CH3). The tert-butyl group is an activating, since it's an alkyl group which donates electrons through sigma bonds.

Wait, but wait, the tert-butyl is a bulky group. So when substituting around it, steric factors may come into play.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about which substituents are introduced first, second, etc.

The order of substitution matters because each new group directs where the next substituent will go. So, the first substituent will be the one that directs the second, and the second directs the third.

So, the key is to find the correct order of introducing these groups so that each new substituent is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Let's list the substituents:

1. Ethoxy (OCH2CH3)
2. tert-Butyl (C(CH3)3)
3. Nitro (NO2)

We need to figure out the order of introduction. Let's think about how each substituent affects the ring's reactivity and the direction of subsequent substituents.

First, benzene is activated towards electrophilic substitution. So, perhaps the first substitution is introducing a strong activating group. Let's consider which substituent is best introduced first.

Wait, the ethoxy is an activating group, but so is tert-butyl. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing, which would complicate further substitutions if introduced early.

So, perhaps the nitro group should be introduced last because introducing it earlier might deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions harder.

Wait, but if we have the nitro group as the last substituent, which reaction is that? The nitro group is typically introduced via nitration, which uses a nitrating mixture (HNO3 in H2SO4). But nitration is a deactivating step, so it's better to do it after activating groups are in place.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to introduce the nitro group first? No, because then the ring would be deactivated, making it harder to add the other groups.

So, the first substitution should be an activating group. Between ethoxy and tert-butyl, which comes first?

Wait, but introducing ethoxy via an etherification reaction (like using Williamson, which requires a good leaving group) might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps ethoxylation can be done via alkylation. Wait, benzene can undergo alkylation via Friedel-Crafts, but wait, ethoxy group is an electron-donating group, which is activating, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses alkyl halides with a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3.

Wait, but ethoxy group can be introduced via alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to introduce the tert-butyl group first because it's a bulky group and may influence the positions where other substituents are added.

Wait, but let's think about each substituent's effect. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating group (alkyl) and is an ortho/para director. The ethoxy group is also activating, ortho/para-directing. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

1. Introduce the tert-butyl group first. Since it's bulky and ortho/para-directing, adding it first will influence where the next substituents go.

2. Next, introduce the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para-directing, but the ring already has a tert-butyl group, which is ortho/para-directing. So, the ethoxy group will go into a position ortho or para to the tert-butyl. But given that we want ethoxy at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2, perhaps that's ortho to each other.

Wait, but let me think again. If the first substituent is tert-butyl in position 2, then the ethoxy would go either ortho (position 1 or 3) or para (position 5, but I'm not sure if that's possible with two substituents).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

Step 1: Introduce tert-butyl group.

So, starting with benzene, first reaction is Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This will give tert-butylbenzene.

Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group at position (let's say) 1. Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, perhaps the tert-butyl is at position 2, but in the first step, benzene is being alkylated. The position where the group enters is arbitrary unless directed by other substituents.

Wait, so the first substitution would be tert-butyl at position 2, but for benzene, the substitution can be in any position. For high yield, perhaps the first substituent is placed para to where the next substituent will be added.

But maybe the order of substitution is such that the nitro group is added last. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first. Let me imagine that.

Wait, but introducing ethoxy via an alkylation step. Wait, benzene can't directly react with, say, ethanol to form ethoxybenzene. Instead, we would typically use a method like the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide. But benzene isn't directly involved in that. Alternatively, the ethoxy group can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using an ethyl halide, but wait, Friedel-Crafts typically uses alkyl halides to introduce alkyl groups, not ether groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but benzene isn't reactive enough for that without activating groups.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced using a different method. Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution after a nitration, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group attached to the benzene ring, which isn't straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonation and then displacement, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated and then reduced. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via alkylation after another activating group is present. Wait, but without any activating groups, benzene is not very reactive towards alkylation. Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation can proceed with benzene, but it's usually challenging because it's a deactivated system. Wait, no, benzene is actually activated towards electrophilic substitution, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires a Lewis acid. So maybe that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts. So benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3, giving tert-butylbenzene. Since tert-butyl is a bulky group, it's ortho/para-directing.

Then, the next step is to introduce the ethoxy group. Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is activating and ortho/para-directing. So, where would the ethoxy group go? It would enter either ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.

In the target molecule, the ethoxy is at position 1, and the tert-butyl is at position 2. So, if the tert-butyl is at position 2, the ethoxy would be at position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl). So, after adding the tert-butyl, the next substitution should be at the ortho position. How can that be achieved?

Wait, but after the first substitution (tert-butyl), the ring has that group, and the next substituent will go ortho or para. So, if I want the ethoxy to be ortho to the tert-butyl, that would be position 1 or 3, depending on where the tert-butyl is placed. But since the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, then the ethoxy and tert-butyl are adjacent.

Wait, but if I first add the tert-butyl, then add the ethoxy group ortho to it, then perhaps the next step is to add the nitro group.

Hmm, but the nitro group is deactivating, so it would direct future substituents to meta positions. But in our target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl and next to the ethoxy. So, let's think.

After adding the ethoxy group ortho to the tert-butyl, the ring now has two activating groups. The tert-butyl is ortho/para, and the ethoxy is ortho/para. So, where would the nitro group go next?

Wait, but nitration is a deactivating reaction. The ring's reactivity is determined by the existing substituents. Since both substituents are activating, the ring remains activated, but the direction of the next substitution depends on the strongest activating group.

Wait, but tert-butyl is a stronger activating group (alkyl groups are stronger activating than alkoxy groups) because alkyl groups donate electrons through sigma bonds more effectively than OCH2CH3, which is an activating group but less so than alkyl groups. Wait, no, actually, the ethoxy group is stronger activating than alkyl groups because it's an electron-donating group (it's an -O- group attached to CH2CH3, which can donate electrons via resonance as well as inductively). Wait, no, alkyl groups donate via induction, while OCH2CH3 can donate via resonance, making it a stronger activating group than alkyl groups.

Wait, no, actually, the order is: -O-R is a stronger activating group than -R (alkyl). Because the lone pairs on oxygen can donate electrons into the ring via resonance, making the ring more activated towards electrophilic substitution. So, the ethoxy group is a stronger activating group than the tert-butyl group.

So, when the ring has both groups, which is more influential? The ethoxy group is stronger activating, so the next substitution would be directed by the ethoxy group.

But wait, the ethoxy is at position 1, and the tert-butyl at position 2. The next substituent (nitro) would be added directed by the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is ortho/para-directing, the nitro group would go either ortho (position 2 or 6, but position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl) or para (position 4) to the ethoxy.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy and adjacent to the tert-butyl. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy, but given that the nitro is a deactivating group, it would affect where other groups are introduced.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro. But how would that work?

Let me outline this:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Now, tert-butyl is at position 1. Next, introduce ethoxy group. Since the tert-butyl is ortho/para-directing, the ethoxy can go either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). Let's say we get it ortho, so ethoxy is at position 2.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2. So perhaps I should have the tert-butyl at position 2, and the ethoxy at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add tert-butyl at position 2, but how? Because in benzene, the first substitution is at a single position, so the first substituent could be anywhere. Then, the next substituent will be directed by the first.

So, if the first substituent is tert-butyl, the second substituent (ethoxy) would be either ortho (position 1 or 3) or para (position 5). But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, the ethoxy would be ortho to the tert-butyl.

So, step 1: tert-butyl added to benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: Introduce ethoxy group ortho to tert-butyl → ethoxy group at position 1.

Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2.

Next, introduce nitro group. At this stage, the ring has two activating groups: ethoxy (stronger than tert-butyl). So, the nitro group would be directed by the ethoxy group. The ethoxy group is ortho/para-directing, so the nitro could go to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy) or position 5 (para to ethoxy). But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So, that's meta to the ethoxy, but ortho to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, position 3 is adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2) and across from ethoxy (position 1). So, when adding the nitro group, if the ethoxy is directing, it's ortho (positions 2 and 6) or para (position 4). But position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl, so nitro would go to para (position 4) or ortho (position 6). But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. So, that doesn't align.

Hmm, maybe the nitro group is introduced in a position where it's directed by the tert-butyl group instead of the ethoxy.

Wait, the tert-butyl group is ortho/para-directing, so if the ethoxy is at position 1 and the tert-butyl at 2, then the tert-butyl would direct the next substituent (nitro) to position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl) or position 6 (para to tert-butyl) or position 5 (meta to tert-butyl? No, wait, tert-butyl is activating, so it directs to ortho and para. So, the nitro could go to position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl) or position 1 (para). But position 1 is already taken by ethoxy, so it would go to position 3.

Aha! So, after adding ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2), the next substitution is directed by the tert-butyl group, which is ortho/para. So, the nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl) or position 6 (para to tert-butyl). But position 6 would be meta to ethoxy.

Wait, but the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Then, the tert-butyl directs the nitro to position 3 (ortho) or position 6 (para). Position 3 is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1), but if the nitro is directed by the tert-butyl, it would go to position 3. Then the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). That matches the target molecule.

So, the order of substitution would be:

1. Add tert-butyl group → position 2.

2. Add ethoxy group → position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl).

3. Add nitro group → position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl).

Wait, but how does the nitro group get added? Nitration is a deactivating step, so after adding the nitro, the ring would be less reactive. But in our case, we have all three substituents, so maybe that's the correct order.

Now, let's think about the reactions.

First reaction: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

Second reaction: Introduce ethoxy group. How? Friedel-Crafts alkylation can introduce alkyl groups, but to introduce an ethoxy group, perhaps we need a different approach. Wait, another possibility is using an etherification method. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction, but without an activating group, it's difficult.

Wait, no, after adding the tert-butyl group, the ring is activated, so perhaps we can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation? Wait, but Friedel-Crafts typically uses alkyl halides, not ether groups. Alternatively, perhaps we can use an ethyl halide in Friedel-Crafts, but wait, that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy group.

Ah, wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strong activating group and a good leaving group. But without that, maybe it's tough.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonation step, followed by displacement. Wait, that might be a possibility.

Wait, after introducing the tert-butyl group, perhaps we can sulfonate the benzene ring, then substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

Wait, but sulfonation is an activating step. So, perhaps after adding the tert-butyl, we can introduce a sulfonic acid group in a position, then substitute it with ethoxy.

For example, step 2: sulfonate the benzene ring at the desired position (ortho to tert-butyl, which is position 1).

Wait, but how? Let me think again. The tert-butyl is at position 2. To add ethoxy at position 1, which is ortho to tert-butyl, perhaps we can sulfonate the ring at position 1, then substitute the sulfonic group with ethoxy.

So, step 2: sulfonate benzene with H2SO4 and H2O to introduce a sulfonic acid group at position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl). Then, perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution with, say, ethanol to replace the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

Wait, but nucleophilic aromatic substitution requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is usually done by strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) meta to the leaving group. But in this case, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is activating, so I'm not sure if that would work. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is a good leaving group, and under certain conditions (like heating with a strong base), it can be replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonating, we can perform an alkylation or another substitution. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a Grignard reagent. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the options given.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of reactions. Let's look for the steps that would correspond to adding the substituents in the correct order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps. Let me try to parse each.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3; ix) H2SO4.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3; iii) HNO3; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3; vii) H3O+/H2O/Heat; viii) H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Option D: i) HNO3; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3; vii) H2SO4; viii) H3O+/H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, let's think about each reaction step.

The target product has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. So, each reaction step would add a substituent or modify existing ones.

The first step in all options is either adding tert-butyl or nitro.

Option D starts with nitration (step i: HNO3/H2SO4). So, the first substituent is nitro group. But nitro is deactivating, making subsequent substitutions harder. So, this might not be the best approach unless the substituents are added in a certain order.

Alternatively, for the correct option, perhaps the first step is adding tert-butyl (steps in options A, B, C start with t-BuCl/AlCl3).

In the correct sequence, the first substituent is tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one has the steps in the order of adding tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro?

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis? Or possibly for something else.

vi) H3O+ and H2O with heat → maybe hydrolysis of a nitro group, but not sure.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, like ethoxy group introduction via substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction, maybe of a nitro group to amine.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Wait, that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure how this would build up the substituents.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe turning diazonium salt into something else.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps an alkylation, but I'm not sure.

viii) SO3 → sulfonation.

ix) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

I'm not sure this sequence leads to the correct product.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration.

vii) H3O+/H2O/Heat → maybe hydrolysis.

viii) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → substitution.

Hm, this seems a bit convoluted.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration, first substituent is nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

viii) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, this starts with nitro, which might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce ethoxy via some method, perhaps a substitution after introducing a leaving group.

3. Introduce nitro via nitration, which would be directed by the existing groups.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B has the correct steps. Let me see.

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. Nitro group added. But after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, so nitration would introduce nitro group. Where?

The tert-butyl is ortho/para-directing. So, the nitro would go ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say para is position 5 (if t-Bu is position 1). But in our target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both t-Bu (2) and ethoxy (1). So, this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps after adding the t-Bu, the next step is to introduce ethoxy. But option B's step ii is nitration after t-Bu. Then step iii is Fe/HCl, which is likely a reduction of nitro to amine.

Wait, but then step iv is HNO3 again. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the steps in option D are:

i) Nitration → adds nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

But this doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro group, which goes ortho to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy group via some method, like substitution.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has been nitrated, but that seems unlikely unless there's a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so it's better to add it last.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Let me try to outline the steps in option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration. Since tert-butyl is ortho/para-directing, nitro could go to position 3 (ortho) or position 5 (para). Let's assume position 3.

Now, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and nitro at 3.

Next, step iii: Fe/HCl → FeCl2, which is a reducing agent. It could reduce nitro groups to amines. So, nitro at 3 becomes amine at 3.

Step iv: HNO3 → nitration again. Now, the ring has t-Bu (2), amine (3), and we nitrate again. Amines are strong activating groups and ortho/para-directing. So, the new nitro would go ortho or para to the amine. But the target only has one nitro group, so this seems confusing.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the correct path.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are in option C.

Option C steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is added, perhaps in a position ortho to t-Bu.

iii) HNO3 → nitration. Nitro group added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration again.

Wait, this seems to have multiple nitrations, which might not be desired.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the way to go, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the introduction of the ethoxy group. In the target molecule, ethoxy is a substituent, so one of the steps must involve adding an ethoxy group.

Looking at the options, which option has a step that introduces an ethoxy group? Let's look for NaOH and EtBr. Oh, in options A, B, and C, there's a step with NaOH and EtBr. That's likely an SN2 reaction, where the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution.

For example, if there's a good leaving group on the ring, like a bromide, then NaOH with EtBr could perform an alkylation, replacing the bromide with ethoxy. But wait, EtBr is an ethyl bromide; in such a reaction, perhaps it's a Williamson-type substitution, but for that, you need a good leaving group attached to the aromatic ring.

So, perhaps in the reaction steps, a bromide is introduced, then replaced by ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

Let me think. So, the steps would involve:

- Introduce a bromine substituent.

- Then, replace that bromine with ethoxy.

But how?

In aromatic substitution, bromine can be replaced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution if the ring is activated towards that. But normally, for that, the ring needs strong electron-withdrawing groups meta to the leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: introduce a nitro group, reduce it to an amine, then introduce a bromine via diazotization and substitution.

Wait, for example, after nitration, the nitro group is reduced to an amine. Then, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt with NaNO2 and HCl. Then, heating with a halide (like Br-) would replace the diazonium group with a bromide.

So, perhaps the steps are:

Introduce nitro → reduce to amine → convert to diazonium → substitute with bromide.

Then, the bromide can be displaced by an ethoxy group via NaOH and EtBr.

Wait, but wait, in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3, so perhaps the nitro is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option's steps again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro group added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolyze diazonium to something.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

I'm not seeing a clear path here.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, again, not clear.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

This seems too many nitration steps.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

viii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

This starts with nitro, which is deactivating. But perhaps the steps after would manage.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add the tert-butyl group.

2. Add the ethoxy group via a substitution step after introducing a leaving group.

3. Add the nitro group via nitration, directed by the existing substituents.

Looking for which option does this.

In option B, after adding t-Bu and nitro, then reducing nitro to amine, then adding another nitro? That doesn't help.

Looking at option C:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) sulfonate → perhaps introduce a leaving group.

iii) nitrate → add nitro.

iv) reduce → amine.

v) diazotize → diazonium.

vi) nitrate → something else.

Hmm, not useful.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl (step i of options A, B, C).

2. Add ethoxy group via substitution (using NaOH and EtBr, step vii in options A, B, C, D).

But how? Because to have a leaving group, perhaps the ring must have a halide.

So, perhaps steps needed are:

a) Introduce a bromine substituent at the desired position.

b) Replace bromine with ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

So, which option has a step that introduces bromine, followed by substitution with ethoxy.

Looking at the options, after which steps is a bromine introduced?

Option D's step iii is adding t-BuCl, which adds t-Bu, not Br.

Option B: No step introduces Br, unless via Fe/HCl, but that's a reduction step.

Option A: Step iv is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which may lead to substitution with Br.

Wait, in the steps of option A:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) sulfonate → perhaps introduce a -SO3H group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize nitro group, but wait, nitro is already present.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is converted to a diazonium salt, which can then be substituted.

So, in option A, after adding nitro, then introducing a leaving group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize nitro to a diazonium salt.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis? Or substitution.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → maybe decompose diazonium salt to a halide.

Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr → substitution of the halide with ethoxy.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitro added.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate (introduce a -SO3H group).

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize nitro to diazonium.

v) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps protonate.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → decompose diazonium to bromide.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute Br with OEt.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduce something.

ix) HNO3 → another nitration.

Wait, this would complicate things, but perhaps the nitro group is introduced, then converted to a bromide, then substituted with ethoxy.

But in the target, the nitro group is present, so perhaps this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, using a leaving group that was previously introduced.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add a leaving group (like Br) at the desired position (where ethoxy should end up).

3. Substitute Br with OEt.

4. Add nitro group via nitration, directed by t-Bu and ethoxy.

So, the correct sequence would require adding Br after t-Bu, then substituting with OEt, then nitrating.

Looking for which option includes adding Br, then substitution with OEt, then nitration.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → adds nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

In this case, after step vii, ethoxy is added. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps after adding t-Bu, the next step is to add a leaving group (like Br) via some method, then substitute with OEt.

Looking at the options, which option has a step that introduces Br?

Hmm, looking at option A:

After adding t-Bu and nitro, then SO3 for sulfonation, then NaNO2 for diazotization, then H2SO4, then substitution with EtBr.

Wait, perhaps in option A, after several steps, they introduce Br and substitute it with OEt.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

i) t-Bu added via AlCl3.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) sulfonate → introduce SO3H.

iv) diazotization → convert nitro to diazonium.

v) H2SO4 → hydrolyze diazonium to Br.

vi) H3O+ and heat → maybe decompose.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitute Br with OEt.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduce something.

ix) nitrate again → add another nitro.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not confident. Let me think again about the target structure.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So, the order of adding substituents is:

t-Bu first (since it's a bulky group, which directs the next substituent to ortho or para.

Then, ethoxy, which should be ortho to t-Bu.

Then, nitro, which should be ortho to t-Bu (i.e., position 3).

So, the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

Now, each step's reaction.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

Step 2: Introduce ethoxy. How?

Perhaps via a substitution. To do that, we need a leaving group at the desired position.

So, after adding t-Bu, perhaps introduce a bromine at the desired position (position 1), then substitute it with ethoxy.

But how to introduce bromine?

One way is to nitrate the ring (add nitro), reduce it to amine, then convert to diazonium salt, and substitute with Br.

Alternatively, perhaps sulfonate the ring, then substitute.

Let me try to outline:

After step 1: t-Bu at position 2.

Step 2: nitrate → nitro added. Since t-Bu is ortho/para-directing, nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to t-Bu) or position 5 (para). Let's say position 3.

Now, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and nitro at 3.

Step 3: reduce nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl) → amine at 3.

Step 4: diazotize amine with NaNO2/HCl → diazonium at 3.

Step 5: substitute diazonium with Br (using Br- in H2O) → Br at 3.

Wait, but we need ethoxy at position 1, which is ortho to t-Bu. So, perhaps the Br should be introduced at position 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong.

Alternative approach:

After adding t-Bu at position 2, we need to add ethoxy at position 1. To do that, perhaps introduce a leaving group (like Br) at position 1, then substitute with ethoxy.

To introduce Br at position 1, which is ortho to t-Bu.

How?

Perhaps, after adding t-Bu, we can nitrate the ring to add nitro group at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu), then reduce nitro to amine, then substitute with Br.

So:

Step 1: add t-Bu → position 2.

Step 2: nitrate → nitro at 1 (ortho to t-Bu).

Step 3: reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl) → amine at 1.

Step 4: diazotize → diazonium at 1.

Step 5: substitute diazonium with Br → Br at 1.

Step 6: substitute Br with ethoxy (NaOH and EtBr) → ethoxy at 1.

Now, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1.

Step 7: add nitro at 3 (ortho to t-Bu). But wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring has two activating groups. The ethoxy is a stronger activating group, so the nitro would be directed by ethoxy. So, nitro would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Ethoxy is at 1, so ortho would be positions 2 and 6, but position 2 is taken by t-Bu, so nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to t-Bu but meta to ethoxy).

Wait, but ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, so position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu and across from ethoxy. Since ethoxy is a stronger activating group, the nitro would be directed by it. Wait, but ethoxy is at 1, so the meta position to ethoxy is position 4. So, perhaps the nitro would not go to position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy group, but directed by the tert-butyl group.

Wait, after adding ethoxy at 1 and t-Bu at 2, the ring has two activating groups. The ethoxy is stronger, but the t-Bu is also activating. So, where would the nitro group go? It depends on which group is more activating and which is more influential.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking for which option's steps would result in the substituents being added in the correct order.

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3 → nitro added. Let's say adds at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro at 3 to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitro added again. Now, where would this go? The ring has t-Bu at 2 and amine at 3. The amine is a strong activating group, so the new nitro would go ortho or para to the amine.

Amine is at 3, so ortho would be positions 2 and 4 (but 2 is t-Bu), so position 4. Alternatively, para would be position 6.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems off.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

iv) HNO3 → nitro added again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4 → sulfuric acid.

viii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

So, if the first step is nitro, then after reduction to amine, t-Bu is added. Then, another nitration.

But this seems to lead to more nitro groups than needed.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Option A's steps:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3 → nitro added.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

v) H2SO4 → dilute.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

So, let's outline:

After step i: t-Bu at 2.

Step ii: nitro added, likely at 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

Step iii: sulfonate → perhaps at position 1.

Step iv: diazotize nitro at 3 → becomes diazonium.

Step v: H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis to Br.

Step vi: H3O+/heat → maybe decompose.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr → substitute Br at 1 with OEt.

So, now we have t-Bu at 2, OEt at 1, and the nitro at 3.

Then, steps viii and ix: reduce something and nitrate again. Not sure.

But the target has only one nitro group. So, perhaps after step vii, the nitro is still present.

Wait, in step iv, the nitro at 3 is converted to diazonium, then in step v, perhaps to Br. Then, in step vii, the Br is substituted with OEt. But that would replace the nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

In that case, after adding t-Bu and ethoxy, nitration would add nitro in a position directed by the existing groups.

Wait, let me think.

If I have t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1, the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by whichever group is more activating. Ethoxy is more activating, so nitro would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Ethoxy is at 1, so ortho would be 2 (t-Bu) and 6. Para would be 4.

But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu.

So, this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the ethoxy group.

Wait, but then the nitro group is deactivating, making it harder to add the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, which introduces nitro first, then reduces it, adds t-Bu, then nitrates again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add ethoxy via substitution.

3. Add nitro via nitration, directed by t-Bu.

So, the steps would be:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

ii) Introduce a leaving group at desired position (1) → perhaps via nitration, reduction to amine, then diazotization to Br.

iii) Substitute Br with OEt.

iv) Nitrate → add nitro.

Looking for which option does this.

Looking at option B:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → perhaps adding another nitro.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, option A: after adding t-Bu and nitro, then sulfonate, then substitute.

But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents, each added via electrophilic substitution. The first substituent is tert-butyl. The second is ethoxy, added via substitution after introducing a leaving group. The third is nitro, added via nitration.

Looking at the steps, the substitution with ethoxy (NaOH/EtBr) must come after introducing a leaving group.

So, in the steps, after adding t-Bu and nitro, perhaps the nitro is converted to a leaving group, then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, but then the nitro would be replaced, which is not desired.

Alternatively, perhaps the leaving group is introduced after adding t-Bu and before adding ethoxy.

So, perhaps the steps are:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

v) Br- → substitute to Br.

vi) NaOH and EtBr → substitute Br with OEt.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again → add nitro.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But without more clarity, I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess based on the options and the logic.

The correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Introduce a leaving group (Br) at the desired position (position 1).

3. Substitute Br with ethoxy.

4. Nitrate to add nitro at position 3.

Looking for an option that includes:

- t-Bu addition.

- introduction of Br.

- substitution with OEt.

- nitration.

Looking at option A:

i) t-BuCl.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) sulfonate → SO3.

iv) diazotize → convert nitro to diazonium.

v) H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolyze to Br.

vi) H3O+/H2O → decompose.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute Br with OEt.

After step vii, the substituents are t-Bu at 2, OEt at 1.

Then, step viii: Fe/HCl → reduce something.

Step ix: nitrate again → add nitro.

But this adds another nitro group. So, perhaps step ix is the nitration step to add nitro at position 3.

So, after step ix, nitro is added at position 3.

But wait, after step vii, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and OEt at 1. So, during step ix, nitration would be directed by the strongest activating group, which is OEt. OEt is at 1, so nitro would go either ortho (position 2, which is t-Bu) or para (position 4). But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is meta to OEt and ortho to t-Bu.

So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the substitution with OEt.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added after substitution with OEt.

Then, the steps would be:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) something → substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Ah, I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess.

I think the correct option is option B. But I'm not entirely certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully introduce the substituents in the correct order, considering their directing effects and the activation/deactivation of the aromatic ring. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - The ethoxy group is a strongly activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - The nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - The order of introduction is critical, as each substituent influences the position of subsequent substitutions.

2. **Optimal Order of Introduction**:
   - The tert-butyl group should be introduced first due to its strong activating nature and ortho/para-directing effects.
   - The ethoxy group should be introduced next, ideally via substitution after introducing a leaving group.
   - The nitro group should be introduced last to avoid deactivating the ring prematurely.

3. **Critical Reactions**:
   - **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - **Nitration**: Adds the nitro group, directed by the tert-butyl group.
   - **Substitution**: Introduces the ethoxy group via a leaving group (e.g., bromine) and NaOH/EtBr.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- Steps:
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.
  2. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring.

  4. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes the nitro group.
  5. Dilute H₂SO₄ → Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt.
  6. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Decomposes the diazonium salt.
  7. NaOH/EtBr → Substitutes with ethoxy.
  8. Fe/HCl → Reduces the nitro group.
  9. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring again.

- Issues:
  - Multiple nitrations and reductions complicate the synthesis.
  - The nitro group may not end up at the correct position (3).

#### **Option B**:
- Steps:
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.
  2. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring.
  3. Fe/HCl → Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
  4. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring again.
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes the nitro group.
  6. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Decomposes the diazonium salt.
  7. NaOH/EtBr → Substitutes with ethoxy.
  8. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates the ring.
  9. Dilute H₂SO₄ → Hydrolyzes the sulfonate.

- Issues:
  - Multiple nitrations and reductions complicate the synthesis.
  - The nitro group may not end up at the correct position (3).

#### **Option C**:
- Steps:
  1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.
  2. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates the ring.
  3. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring.
  4. Fe/HCl → Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes the nitro group.
  6. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring again.
  7. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Decomposes the diazonium salt.
  8. Dilute H₂SO₄ → Hydrolyzes the sulfonate.
  9. NaOH/EtBr → Substitutes with ethoxy.

- Issues:
  - Multiple nitrations and reductions complicate the synthesis.
  - The nitro group may not end up at the correct position (3).

#### **Option D**:
- Steps:
  1. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring.
  2. Fe/HCl → Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
  3. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl.
  4. HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring again.
  5. NaNO₂/HCl → Diazotizes the nitro group.
  6. SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates the ring.
  7. Dilute H₂SO₄ → Hydrolyzes the sulfonate.
  8. H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → Decomposes the diazonium salt.
  9. NaOH/EtBr → Substitutes with ethoxy.

- Issues:
  - Starting with nitration introduces a deactivating group early, making subsequent substitutions difficult.
  - Multiple nitrations and reductions complicate the synthesis.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence must introduce the tert-butyl group first, followed by the ethoxy group via substitution, and finally the nitro group via nitration. Among the options, **Option B** aligns most closely with this logic, despite some ambiguity in the exact placement of substituents.

**Answer: B**
