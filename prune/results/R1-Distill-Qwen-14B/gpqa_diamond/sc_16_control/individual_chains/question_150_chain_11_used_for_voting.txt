Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question gives the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, the compound undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The data is:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's interpret each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) with 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which often suggests an aldehyde proton (RCHO). But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. However, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But why a triplet? Unless there's coupling with adjacent protons. Hmm. Could it be part of an enal, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde?

The 6.98 ppm doublet (2H) and 6.51 ppm doublet (2H) might be from an aromatic ring. Typically, aromatic protons are in the 6.5-8 ppm range. A doublet of 2H each suggests perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, but wait: if it's a para-substituted benzene, the coupling would be between the two sets of two protons. Let me think. If we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, perhaps they are part of a para-substituted ring with substituents in the ortho positions? Or maybe it's part of a coupling in a conjugated system.

Wait, actually, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene. For example, in a para-substituted ring, you get two doublets each of 2H. So the 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two para-substituted aromatic rings. Or wait, maybe it's a single para-substituted ring with two sets of protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where each substituent is at the para position of another ring.

Then, the peak at 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) with 2H. Broad singlet could indicate exchange with something like an -OH group. If there are two protons, maybe it's a di-substituted ring with adjacent protons, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton, but those are usually a bit downfield but not as much as 9 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps this is a conjugated diene or an allylic system.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (d, 2H) suggests protons adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's a CH2O group. The doublet integration indicates two protons, so perhaps a CH2 group next to something like an oxygen, like OCH2.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with an ethyl group attached to oxygen, perhaps an acetal or something similar. Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: For C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, assuming no rings yet. So here, X (halogens) are zero. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation: that's one ring and four double bonds, or a combination. For example, a benzene ring (three double bonds and one ring, so four degrees) plus a double bond, like an enal.

Wait, so that would fit with the aldehyde and some conjugated system. So considering the aldehyde proton, aromatic rings, and perhaps a conjugated enal.

Wait, looking at the options, all the products are various butenals with diphenyl groups. So the starting material might be a diphenylethyl aldehyde or something similar.

Let me think again about the NMR. The 9.72 triplet (1H) suggests an aldehyde. But why a triplet? Aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are typically deshielded. A triplet would imply coupling with two adjacent protons. So, maybe the aldehyde is conjugated to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is R-CH2-CHO, but that would make the aldehyde a triplet if the CH2 is adjacent. Wait, but in that case, each aldehyde proton would couple with two -CH2- protons. So for example, if the structure is R-CH2-CHO, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet, as the CH2 would split it into a triplet. But wait, in reality, aldehyde protons are usually not split that way because they're usually at the end, but maybe in some cases.

Wait, but in an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, the aldehyde proton is conjugated. So the structure might be something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, because that wouldn't explain the aromatic peaks or the 3.66 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is something like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO? No, that seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about the 3.66 d (2H). That could be a CH2 next to an oxygen. Maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal.

Wait, considering the molecular formula, and the NMR, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with an ethyl group attached via an oxygen. For example, maybe it's benzyl acetate or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR and the reactions.

The first step is NaNO2 and HCl, which is a diazotization reagent. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic ring with an amine group. Because diazotization is typically done on aromatic amines (like anilines) to form diazonium salts.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. N is present, so perhaps the structure has an amino group. But in the NMR, I don't see a peak that corresponds to an amine. Usually, aromatic amines are deprotonated under certain conditions, but in the NMR given, perhaps it's not showing up because of exchange or being in another region.

Wait, but the molecular formula has one N and one O. So if it's an aniline derivative, the N would be in the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol (O) and an amine.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aniline derivative with an aldehyde group. For example, a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and an amine group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks in the 3-4 ppm region (which is typical for amines). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is in a ring as aniline, which would show a peak around 7 ppm, but that's already accounted for in the aromatic region.

Alternatively, maybe the N is part of an amide or another functional group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a naphthylamine derivative, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the N is part of an aromatic ring as a substituent, like in pyridine. But pyridine protons are usually in a different region.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzylamine derivative. But then, the amino group would show up around 1.5-3 ppm, but I don't see such a peak here.

Wait, perhaps the N is part of an amide. But amides have NH protons that are usually broad, but the NMR doesn't show any such peaks except for the 6.27 ppm, which is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's an enol form.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an aromatic ring with substituents and an aldehyde group, along with an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached via an oxygen, such as Ph-O-CH2-CHO. But then, the 3.66 ppm would be the OCH2, which is split into a doublet because of coupling with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but then the aldehyde would be at the end, so the aldehyde proton would be a singlet. But in the NMR, it's a triplet. Hmm.

Another thought: maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would mean the aldehyde is a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. Because the CH2 would have two protons, and the aldehyde proton would be next to them. So the coupling would be through two J values? Wait, no, in that case, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet because each of the two protons on the adjacent CH2 would split it into a triplet. So maybe that's it.

Wait, but then the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. If the structure is Ph-CH2-O-R, but wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH2-O-R. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think of the NMR. Another thing: the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests exchange with another group, like an -OH. So maybe there's a dihydroxy group or an enol form.

Wait, maybe the structure is a conjugated dienol. Or perhaps it's a dihydroxy group adjacent to a double bond.

Alternatively, it's an aldehyde with an adjacent CH2-OH group. Wait, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with a vinyl group and some substituents. Let me think: if the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that would have the aldehyde as a triplet. But then, the 3.66 ppm would be the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde, but in that case, it would be a triplet as well, not a doublet.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CHO, but then the CH2 would be split into a triplet by the aldehyde proton. But in the NMR, the CH2 is a doublet, so maybe it's next to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO? But that seems more complicated and the formula would have more oxygens.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach. The reactions given:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is diazotization. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine (like aniline). Therefore, the compound has an NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

2. H2O: Diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. Depending on the conditions, this can lead to different products. For example, if it's in aqueous acid, it might form a phenol. Alternatively, if it's in a basic solution, it might form a carboxylic acid.

3. aq. KOH, Heat: This sounds like hydrolysis under basic conditions, perhaps of an ester or a nitrile, but more likely, it's a Dieckmann or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a saponification if it's an ester.

Wait, but the initial reagent is diazotization. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine. So the structure must have an -NH2 group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, I don't see any peaks that would correspond to an NH2 group. Because aromatic amines are usually deprotonated under the conditions of diazotization (which is typically done at low temperature, like 0-5°C, in HCl), so the amine would be deprotonated and not show up in the NMR as a peak. So that fits.

So the structure has an aromatic amine, which upon diazotization will form a diazonium salt. Then, when heated with water, perhaps the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, giving a phenol. Alternatively, if the conditions are acidic, it might form a different product, but I think in water, it's more likely to form a phenol.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions.

Reaction 1: Diazotization of an aromatic amine to form a diazonium chloride.

Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Under acidic conditions (like with HCl), the diazonium salt can undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. The typical reaction is RNH2 → R-N2+Cl- → H2O → R-OH.

So after step 2, the NH2 group is replaced by an OH group.

Then, step 3: aqueous KOH and heat. That's basic conditions and heat. What reactions occur under those conditions? Maybe it's an elimination reaction or a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, it could be the formation of a carbonyl group from a diol or something.

Wait, but what was the starting material before the reactions? Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is C8H9NO, with an aromatic amine.

Hmm. Maybe the starting structure is something like 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. But that would give a formula of C8H9NO2, which doesn't fit. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so the molecular formula is missing an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CHO. Molecular formula: C7H7NO, which doesn't fit because the given formula is C8H9NO.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diphenyl compound. Like diphenylacetaldehyde with an amine group.

Wait, maybe it's 4-aminoacetophenone? Structure: Ph-NH2-C(O)-CH3. But molecular formula would be C9H11NO, which again doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's 4-amino benzyl aldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Formula: C9H11NO. Again, not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is 4-amino-3-phenylpropenal. Let's see: Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an NH2 group and an aldehyde group connected via some chain. Let's see, molecular formula C8H9NO. Benzene ring (C6H5) plus an aldehyde (CHO) and an NH2 group. So that would be C7H7NO. But the given formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps an extra carbon.

Ah, so maybe the structure includes another substituent. Let me think. Another carbon could be an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. That would be Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2 with an aldehyde? No, that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 4-amino-3-phenylprop-1-en-1-al. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR again. The 9.72 ppm triplet is the aldehyde. The 3.66 ppm doublet is probably a CH2 next to an oxygen. Maybe it's OCH2. So perhaps the structure has an aldehyde, a CH2O group, and an aromatic ring with an NH2.

Wait, so perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO. Let's see: the aldehyde would be at the end, so the proton would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. The 3.66 ppm would be the OCH2, which is split into a doublet because it's adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, the aromatic protons would be as observed.

But the molecular formula would be C10H10O2, which doesn't fit C8H9NO. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the molecular formula. C8H9NO.

Degrees of unsaturation: 5.

Which could be: one benzene ring (3 double bonds, 1 ring) and an aldehyde (1 double bond), so total 4. Then, one more double bond perhaps from an alkene. Alternatively, a benzene and a carbonyl group (aldehyde) plus another double bond.

Wait, but that would require more than 5 degrees. Hmm, perhaps the starting material has a benzene ring, an aldehyde, and a double bond elsewhere, plus the amine.

Wait, let's think of the structure as diphenylethylamine with an aldehyde. No, but the formula doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an aminoethyl group. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO? No, that would add too many carbons.

I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should look at the reaction steps again.

After reaction 1 (diazotization), the amine becomes a diazonium salt. Reaction 2 (H2O) would likely replace the diazonium group with an -OH, giving a phenol. Then, reaction 3 is aq. KOH and heat, which could cause elimination, perhaps a dehydration reaction.

So, the starting material has an aromatic amine and some other groups. After replacing the amine with an OH, the next step might be a base-catalyzed elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, let's imagine that the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group and a CH2 group that can undergo elimination.

For example, if the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO

But that might not fit the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO? No, that's too many carbons.

Wait, another possibility: the starting structure is o-aminobenzaldehyde (Ph-NH2-CHO), but that's only C7H7NO. The given formula is C8H9NO, so it's one carbon larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group attached to the benzene. So, the formula would be C8H9NO. Let me calculate:

Ph is C6H5, CH2-CHO is C2H3O, and NH2 adds N and two Hs. So total C8H8O N? Wait, C6H5 (C6H5) + CH2CHO (CH2=CHO is C2H3O) → C6 + C2 = C8, H: 5*2 (Ph) is 5 H? Wait, benzene has five H's if one is substituted. Wait, no, if it's C6H5-CH2-CHO, the benzene has five H's? No, benzene has six H's, but substitution would reduce that by one per substituent. So, if two substituents are present on the benzene (like NH2 and CH2CHO), then each substitution takes away one H. So, benzene would have 4 H's. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Ph group is C6H5, then CH2CHO is C2H3O, and NH2 is N. So total formula is C6 + C2 = C8, H: 5 (Ph) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (NH2) → Wait, but that's not correct. Maybe it's better to count each part.

Ph-CH2-CHO with NH2 attached elsewhere on the benzene.

So, benzene (6 C, 5 H if one substituent) but in this case, two substituents: NH2 and CH2CHO. So benzene would have 4 H's. So the structure would be:

Ph: C6H4 (since two substituents)
Then the substituents: NH2 and CH2CHO.

So the formula would be C6H4 * (NH2) * (CH2CHO). Let's compute:

C6 + (1 from NH2) + (2 from CH2CHO) → C6 + 3 = C9? No, wait: NH2 doesn't add a C. Wait, the substituents are CH2CHO (which is C2H3O) and NH2 (which is N). So the entire molecule is:

C6H4-NH2-CH2-CHO → C6 + C2 = C8, H: 4 (from C6H4) + 2 (from CH2) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (NH2) → Wait, H count may be off. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group attached to the benzene, making the formula C8H9NO.

Let me count:

Ph group: 6 C, (if two substituents, benzene has 4 H's)
CH2CHO: 2 C, 3 H (CH2 has 2 H, CHO has 1 H)
NH2: 1 N, 2 H

So total C: 6 + 2 = 8 → correct.

H: 4 (Ph) + 3 (CH2CHO) + 2 (NH2) = 9 → correct.

O: 1 from CHO → correct.

N: 1 from NH2 → correct.

So the formula is C8H9NO. So the structure would be 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, that would place NH2 on the benzene and CH2CHO as another substituent.

But how does this fit the NMR?

The aldehyde proton is at 9.72 ppm as a triplet. That would happen if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, which would split the aldehyde proton into a triplet. So in this structure, the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group, which is attached to the benzene via NH2.

Wait, but in the structure I'm considering, the NH2 is on the benzene, and the CH2CHO is another substituent. So the aldehyde would be on a CH2 group, making the aldehyde proton a triplet.

The 3.66 ppm would be the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde, which is a doublet because it's next to another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a CH2 attached to an oxygen.

Wait, in the structure I'm thinking of, the CH2 is between the benzene and the aldehyde, so the protons on CH2 would be next to the aldehyde. So the CH2 would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CHO, but that would require an oxygen. Let me see: formula would be C8H8O2, which doesn't match. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the structure has an ethyl group attached to the benzene via an oxygen, like Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO. But then the formula would be C9H10O3, which is off.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group attached to the benzene. So the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2 group leading to the aldehyde.

Wait, no, 4-aminobenzaldehyde is Ph-NH2-CHO. That would be C7H7NO. But the given formula is C8H9NO, so one more carbon. So perhaps the benzaldehyde has a CH2 group attached to the aldehyde, making it Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO.

So the structure would be Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Let's see:

Ph: C6H5
NH2: -NH2
CH2: -CH2-
CHO: -CHO

Wait, but attaching that way, the NH2 and CH2CHO are separate substituents on the benzene.

But the NMR would show the aldehyde as a triplet because the CH2 has two protons. The CH2 would then be split into a quartet because it's next to the aldehyde, but in the NMR, the CH2 is at 3.66 as a doublet. Hmm, perhaps it's coupled with something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the structure is diphenyl with an amine. For example, diphenylamine with some substituents. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. But then, the formula would be C8H9NO. Let's check:

Ph (C6H5) + CH2CHO (C2H3O) + NH2 (N) → C6 + 2 = C8, H: 5 (Ph) + 3 (CH2CHO) + 2 (NH2) → 10 H? But the formula is C8H9NO, which has 9 H, so that's off by one.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reactions.

After the first two steps, the NH2 becomes an OH. So the product after step 2 would be a phenol. Then, in step 3, under basic conditions and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

So the starting material must have a structure that, upon substitution of NH2 with OH, and then elimination, would form a conjugated aldehyde.

Looking at the answer options:

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure: Ph-OH attached to a but-3-enal group. So, CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph?

Wait, but the formula for but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CHO with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond introduced.

Wait, maybe the starting material was Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure has an aldehyde, an aromatic ring with an amine, and another substituent that can form a double bond upon elimination.

Let me think of the product after all reactions. The final product is one of the options, which all have either but-enal or similar structures with diphenyl groups.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure: 

O=CH-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH?

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So if it's 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, the structure would be:

Ph-OH attached to the third carbon of but-3-enal. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(Ph-OH)CHO.

Wait, but that would have more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond.

No, perhaps it's:

CHO-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH, but with a double bond. So but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. If the middle CH2 is substituted with a phenol group, then it becomes CH2=CH-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO. Wait, that's but-2-enal.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde with a phenol group attached.

Wait, considering the reagents:

Reaction 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a base-catalyzed elimination. So if the molecule after step 2 has an -OH group and adjacent hydrogens, it could eliminate water to form a double bond.

So, if after step 2, the molecule is Ph-OH-CH2-CHO, under basic conditions, it could lose water to form Ph-OH-CH2-CHO → Ph-OH-CH2-CHO → no, perhaps elimination would form a double bond between the CH2 and CHO.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the two CH2 groups adjacent to each other could eliminate water, forming a double bond between the first and second CH2, leading to Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO → not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the CH2 and CHO could undergo elimination, but that would require adjacent hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, under elimination, it would lose H2O to form Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO, which would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond between the CH2 and CHO groups.

But I'm not completely confident. Let me try to think of each step.

Initial structure: has an aromatic amine, an aldehyde group, and some other substituents.

Reaction 1: Diazotization → forms diazonium salt.

Reaction 2: Hydrolysis → replaces the diazonium group with -OH. So now, the structure has a phenol group.

Reaction 3: Aqueous KOH, heat → elimination reaction, perhaps forming an enal.

So, the starting material after step 2 has a phenol group and an aldehyde with a CH2 group that can eliminate to form a double bond.

For example, if the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO, then under basic conditions, it could lose H2O from the CH2-CHO group, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups, leading to Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO → but that's not possible because the double bond would be between the CH2 and CHO, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, elimination would form Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO, which would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

Wait, but that would require adjacent CH2 and CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, elimination would form Ph-OH-CH=CHO, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. But that would make the product a cinnamaldehyde derivative.

But looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: Ph-OH attached to the third carbon of but-3-enal.

But but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. If the third carbon (the one adjacent to the aldehyde) is substituted with Ph-OH, then the structure would be CH2=CHCH(Ph-OH)CHO.

Wait, that would require four carbons in the aldehyde part. The but-3-enal is four carbons: CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, I think but-3-enal is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. So the aldehyde is at position 1, double bond between 2 and 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO. That would be 3-phenylpropenal-2.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm getting off track.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal.

Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-Ph-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.

No, but but-3-enal would be from 1 to 4 positions. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between 3 and 4? Or between 2 and 3?

Wait, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, in option A, it's 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal, meaning that the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that can't be because but-3-enal would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but I'll proceed.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the aldehyde is on C1, the double bond between C3 and C4 (wait, that's not possible because but-3-enal would have a four-carbon chain).

Wait, maybe the structure for but-3-enal is:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2, with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would require five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-enal is CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. No, that's but-2-enal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the product as an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde with a phenol substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure after step 2 has a hydroxyl group and a CH2CH2CHO group, which upon elimination forms a double bond nearby.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about each reagent again. Diazotization (step 1) converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Step 2, hydrolysis, replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl. So, NH2 becomes OH.

Then, step 3 is aq. KOH and heat, which is basic conditions. So perhaps it's an elimination reaction, like the formation of an enal from a geminal diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: after the substitution of NH2 to OH, the molecule has a structure that can undergo intramolecular aldol condensation, forming a double bond and a ring. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the CH2-CHO group could lose water, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the structure would become Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO. But that would require the elimination of H2O from positions adjacent to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination occurs between the CH2-OH and the CHO groups, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO.

Reaction 1: Diazotization → Ph-N2+Cl- -CH2-CHO.

Reaction 2: Hydrolysis → Ph-OH-CH2-CHO.

Reaction 3: Basic conditions → elimination of H2O, forming Ph-OH-CH=CHO.

So the product would be Ph-OH-CH=CHO, which is cinnamic aldehyde with a phenol group. But looking at the options, I don't see this exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a longer chain. Let's say the structure after step 2 is Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, elimination would form Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO, which would be but-3-enal with a phenol group on the third carbon.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, let me recount the options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal → two phenyl groups on carbons 2 and 4.

B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal → two hydroxyphenyl groups on carbons 2 and 4, double bond at 2.

C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal → two hydroxyphenyl groups on 2 and 4, hydroxy on 3, butanal is a four-carbon aldehyde.

D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal → phenol group on carbon 4, double bond at 3.

Hmm, after elimination, if the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde with a phenol substituent, perhaps that's option D.

So, putting it all together:

Starting material is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde (Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO).

After step 1: diazonium salt.

After step 2: Ph-OH-CH2-CHO.

After step 3: elimination under basic conditions forms Ph-OH-CH=CHO, which is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal? Wait, no, that would be a three-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is longer. Let me think.

If the starting material is Ph-NH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, then after step 2, it would be Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, elimination would form Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO, which is but-3-enal, with the phenol on the first carbon.

Wait, but that's not matching the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has two phenyl groups, making the product have two phenyl groups.

Wait, looking at option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So, phenyl groups on C2 and C4.

So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(Ph)-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4.

But I'm not sure how that would form from the given starting material.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenyl propargyl aldehyde. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzalacetophenone derivative with an amine, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure has two benzene rings attached via a chain that includes an amine and an aldehyde.

Wait, if the starting structure is diphenylmethanol with an amine and aldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzyl acetate, but that would have an ester group.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the final product options.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure: the aldehyde is at position 1, the double bond between positions 3 and 4, with a phenol group at position 4.

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which would require five carbons? No, but the but implies four carbons.

Wait, maybe but-3-enal is a typo, and it should be but-2-enal. Because but-3-enal would be between C3 and C4, but but has four carbons, so the numbering would go 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's impossible because but has only four carbons. So but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's only four carbons. Wait, no. Let me think:

but-1-enal: CH2=CHCH2CHO

but-2-enal: CH3CH=CHCHO

but-3-enal: CH2CH2CH=CHO? That can't be.

So perhaps but-3-enal is not possible, and that's a typo. So perhaps it's but-2-enal.

Assuming that, the product in option D would be 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.

So the structure would be Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO.

In this structure, the aldehyde is at C1, the double bond between C2 and C3, and a phenol group at C4. But that would require five carbons, which is more than but.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the final product is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which would have the structure:

CHO-CH2-CH(Ph-OH)-CH2.

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CHO-CH2-CH=CH-Ph-OH.

But that would be but-2-enal with a substituent on the fourth carbon.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-diphenylbut-2-enal (option C). Structure: two phenyl groups on C2 and C4, hydroxy on C3, and double bond at C2.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The starting material has an aromatic amine and an aldehyde. After substitution and elimination, the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde with a phenol group.

Looking at the options, option D seems to fit this description. So the final product is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The molecular formula of the compound is **C₈H₉NO**, and the provided NMR data is analyzed as follows:

- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: This is consistent with an aldehyde proton, which is typically around 9-10 ppm. The triplet splitting suggests coupling with two adjacent protons.
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: These are indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the two doublets integrate to 2H each.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet suggests exchangeable protons, likely from an -OH group.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet integrating to 2H suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen.

The molecular formula **C₈H₉NO** has **5 degrees of unsaturation**, which can be attributed to one benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond or ring. The presence of an aldehyde group, an aromatic ring, and an -OH group suggests the compound is likely a benzaldehyde derivative with an aromatic amine.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **NaNO₂ + HCl**: This reagent is used for diazotization, indicating the starting compound contains an aromatic amine (-NH₂). The diazonium salt formed will later undergo substitution.
2. **H₂O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.
3. **Aq. KOH, Heat**: Basic conditions and heat promote elimination, likely forming an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

### Final Product:
After the reactions, the product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with a phenol group. Among the options provided, **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal** (Option D) matches this description. The structure features an aldehyde group at position 1, a double bond between positions 3 and 4, and a phenol group at position 4.
