Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator represented as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S is a matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

I remember that S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me think, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the sigma_y matrix. So S is σy.

So then Ay = c * σy. Since c is h/(4π), that's a constant.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to solve Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue. Wait, but wait, the problem states that the matrix is 2x2, so we can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, but I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix (like σy) are ±1. So for σy, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. But since Ay is c times σy, the eigenvalues should be c*(+1) and c*(-1), so a = ±c.

So c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Because c= h/(4π), so a = ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this. Let's check the options.

Option A: Imaginary part of eigenvalue are ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues are real or complex? The Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues. Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1, which are real. So in this case, Ay's eigenvalues are real, so the eigenvectors are real? Or wait, eigenvectors for Pauli matrices are complex. But the eigenvalues are real. So option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense. So probably A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. So B says the eigenvalues have complex parts, which isn't the case here. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, if an operator commutes with another, their eigenfunctions can be chosen to be the same. So A is the angular momentum operator, and A² is the square. Since Ay and A² must commute because A² is the sum of squares of Ax, Ay, Az, and each component commutes with the square. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C says that, but it also says they aren't eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because the components of angular momentum don't commute. So the same eigenvector can't be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az, since those operators don't commute. So C seems correct, but let me check the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, not sure what that means. Basis functions for the operator? Maybe it's saying that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvectors (assuming it's diagonalizable, which it is because σy is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 1 and -1). So the eigenvectors would form a basis, so D is correct? Or is it not necessarily the case? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, certain things hold.

Let me recap the eigenvalues. So Ay has eigenvalues ±(h/(4π)). So looking at the options, none of them directly match. Wait, looking back, the options don't directly say that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the eigenvalues of S. Wait, S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues become ±c. So a = ± (h/(4π)).

Looking at the options again:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary and real parts. As we've established, the eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: same issue, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is true because A² commutes with Ay. They can share eigenfunctions. But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. I think this is a bit ambiguous. The basis functions for the operator would be the eigenvectors, but perhaps this is not the correct way to phrase it. Alternatively, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D could be correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So for option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps what it means is that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which they do. But does the operator's matrix have eigenvectors as its basis? Well, the matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So D could be correct.

But wait, the question is asking which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one option could be correct, but looking at the options, only one is the correct answer.

Let me think again about the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are real, ± (h/(4π)). So none of the options A or B are correct because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

So among the options, C and D are possible.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so the functions can't be eigenfunctions of both.

Option D is a bit unclear. If the eigenfunctions form the basis for Ay, but since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors would form a basis. So I think D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question asks which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let me think again.

Wait, the statement in option D is "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, the eigenfunctions may or may not form the basis, but for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct, as the eigenvectors form a basis.

But in reality, the operator's matrix is already in terms of the basis. The eigenvectors are basis vectors for the space, but perhaps the question is not about that. Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because the matrix operator Ay is expressed in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions might not be the same as the standard basis.

Wait, the standard basis is |+,x> and |-,x>, but if we're using the eigenbasis of Ay, then the matrix would be diagonal. So perhaps the basis functions are the eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay (since A² = Ax² + Ay² + Az²), so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute, so the same eigenvector cannot be eigenfunctions of both.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I think this is trying to say that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space, which they do, but it's not necessarily the standard basis. So the statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, making D correct. But I'm not sure if 'basis functions of the matrix operator' is the correct way to put it.

Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because the operator is represented in a particular basis, and its eigenfunctions are in another basis.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

So, the eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). So for the eigenvalues, none of options A or B match. So the correct eigenvalue statements must not be in the options.

Now, regarding the options C and D. Which one is correct?

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is true, but not of Az. Since A² and Ay commute, their eigenfunctions can be shared. So C is correct.

Option D: Whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. The matrix is Ay, which is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, not necessarily for the operator, but perhaps the statement is correct.

So which option is correct?

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So D may be correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is the same as the operator's space. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: think about the eigenvectors of Ay. The matrix Ay is proportional to σy, which has eigenvectors |+y> and |-y>, which are the same as the eigenstates of Ay. These states are not the same as the eigenstates of Az, which are |+z> and |-z>. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is what option C says. So C is correct.

So the correct statement would be option C.

Wait, but what about option D? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct as well. But wait, the matrix is given in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator when diagonalized. So if we change the basis, the matrix would be diagonal. So the eigenvectors are the basis for that representation.

But the problem says that the matrix operator is given as Ay = c * S, which is in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are in a different basis, not the standard basis. So when you calculate the eigenvectors of Ay, they are in a different basis. Therefore, the eigenfunctions may not be the same as the standard basis vectors. So the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not sure that's correct, because the matrix is in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The matrix operator might be represented in a certain basis, but the eigenfunctions are in another basis. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis in which Ay is represented. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the wording in D is a bit tricky. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That might imply that the eigenvectors are the basis that the matrix is expressed in. But that's not necessarily the case. So D is incorrect.

So the correct statement is C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot \sigma_y \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, not complex. Therefore, any option suggesting complex eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (since \( A^2 = A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2 \)).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes option C correct.

3. **Option D:**
   - The statement claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the "basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \)." This is ambiguous. While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, they are not necessarily the same as the basis in which \( A_y \) is represented (which is the standard basis). Thus, this statement is not strictly correct.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest complex eigenvalues, which is not the case.
   - Option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions do not necessarily form the basis of the operator \( A_y \) as represented in the standard basis.
   - Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
