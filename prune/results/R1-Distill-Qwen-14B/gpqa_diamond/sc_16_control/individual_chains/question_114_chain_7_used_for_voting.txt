Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. And the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which I think is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Hmm.

Wait, so butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives that product. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. But under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I think the reaction of ketones with nitriles is called the cyanohydrin formation. Right, the cyanohydrin reaction. So when a ketone reacts with cyanide ions (like from NaCN), in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The acid is necessary to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So in this case, reagent A must be an acid. Looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid but can also act as a source of bisulfite ions. But for cyanohydrin formation, I think we usually use a strong acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ as the catalyst. So A would be H3O+ in this case.

So looking at the options, which ones have A as H3O+? Options A and B. So that narrows it down to A or B.

Now, the second reaction. The product from the first reaction, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but wait, no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a larger molecule—maybe a benzyl group attached. Then, it's reacting with reagent B and water to form the corresponding butanoic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (CN) is converting into a carboxylic acid (COOH). How does that happen? Oh, right! Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. There are two common conditions for this: acidic and basic hydrolysis.

In the presence of water and acid, the nitrile would undergo hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid. So the conditions would be H2O and an acid catalyst. What's B here? It's either HCl or CH3COOH or another acid.

Wait, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The second step. So the reagent B is the acid. So what's a strong acid that's commonly used? HCl is a strong acid, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes H2SO4 is used, but it's not an option here. The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again.

Wait, the first reaction used H3O+ as the acid. For the second reaction, which is nitrile to acid, the typical condition is using a strong acid. So HCl would be a possible choice. So B is HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says B is HCl. So A would be H3O+, and B is HCl. So that would match. So the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (B is HCl). So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me think again. For the nitrile hydrolysis, does it specifically need HCl? Or could it be another acid like CH3COOH? Well, I think in the presence of H2O and a strong acid, like HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze under reflux conditions to form the carboxylic acid. For example, using HCl in H2O as the reagent.

Alternatively, sometimes for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides and then to acids, you might use a weak acid, but I think for the direct conversion to acid, a strong acid is better. So B should be HCl.

So looking at the options again: option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option B has B=CH3COOH. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but looking back, the second reaction's reagent is B. So when the second reaction is written, it's B plus H2O. So B is the acid. So B is either HCl or another acid. So option A is correct.

The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with cyanide ions (CN⁻) to form the product. For this reaction, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is commonly used for such reactions, making A = H₃O⁺ the suitable choice.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction, where the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). This reaction typically requires water and an acid catalyst. HCl is a strong acid and is commonly used for this purpose, making B = HCl the suitable choice.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for A, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the cyanohydrin formation reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
