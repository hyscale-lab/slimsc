Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, which I think means that initially, the pion is at rest. So, the total momentum before decay is zero because the pion isn't moving. 

Wait, the problem gives the rest masses. Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Oh right, but the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to these, so I can probably ignore it. Or maybe the problem treats it as massless? I should remember that.

So the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon and the neutrino are the products, but since the neutrino is massless, its energy would just be its kinetic energy, right? Because its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but in this case, the pion is decaying into the muon and a neutrino. So the muon has some rest mass, and the neutrino is massless. So the total energy after the decay must equal the total energy before. 

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. So, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

So, the muon's momentum (p_mu) is equal in magnitude to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu), but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. 

But wait, how does that help me find their kinetic energies? Oh, right, because the kinetic energy is related to the momentum via the relativistic energy equations.

The pion's rest mass is m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon's rest mass is m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is zero, so m_nu = 0.

So, the total energy before decay is just E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is the muon's total energy, which is gamma * m_mu c², and E_nu is the neutrino's energy, which is just p_nu c because m_nu is zero. 

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So, p_mu = -p_nu. 

Hmm, maybe I can write the energies in terms of their momenta. 

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then, the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. 

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no, units-wise, maybe I should express everything in MeV and appropriate units. Let me think in terms of MeV and c=1 units (so c=1 for simplicity in these units).

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

Because for the neutrino, since m_nu=0, E_nu = p. 

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

But this must equal the pion's rest energy, which is m_pi. So:

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, let me denote sqrt(p^2 +105.7²) as X. Then, X + p = 139.6.

But X = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2).

Hmm, perhaps I can square both sides. Let me rearrange first:

X = 139.6 - p.

So, X² = (139.6 - p)^2.

But X² is p² + (105.7)^2.

So:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

So, p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p².

The p² terms cancel out on both sides. 

So,

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * p.

Let me compute the squares:

105.7^2 = 11172.49 (because 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7*100= wait, no, wait 105.7^2 is (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 ≈ 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let me compute 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 140 -0.4. So, (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So putting back into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p.

Let's compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 -19488.16 = -279.2 p.

Compute the left side: 19488.16 -11172.49 is 8315.67, so 11172.49-19488.16 is -8315.67.

So,

-8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = (-8315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2. Let's approximate.

279.2 *29 is 279.2*30=8376, minus 279.2 gives 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 29*279.2=8096.8?

Wait maybe better to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me approximate: 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 30 =8376, so 29.7 is 30 -0.3. So 279.2 *0.3=83.76. So 8376 -83.76=8292.24.

So 29.7 *279.2 =8292.24.

But 8292.24 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8292.24=23.43.

So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So p ≈29.784.

So p≈29.78 MeV/c?

Wait, but I'm using units where c=1, so p is in MeV/c? Not sure. But perhaps the exact value isn't critical, but moving on.

So, p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Then, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: 29^2 is 841, 0.78^2≈0.608, and cross terms 2*29*0.78 ≈45.84. So 29.78^2 ≈ 841 +45.84 +0.608 ≈ 887.45.

Wait, wait wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 29.78^2 precisely: 29.78 *29.78.

Let me compute 30 -0.22. So (30 -0.22)^2 =900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 =900 -13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

So 29.78^2=886.8484.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2=886.8484 +11172.49=12059.3384.

So E_mu= sqrt(12059.3384)= about 109.815 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 is about 12056.04, and 109.81^2= (109.8+0.01)^2=109.8² + 2*109.8*0.01 +0.0001≈12056.04 +2.196 +0.0001≈12058.2361. Hmm, but our value is 12059.3384, which is a bit higher. Let's see, 109.8^2=12056.04, 109.85^2=?

109.85 =109 +0.85.

Compute (109.85)^2: (109)^2 + 2*109*0.85 +0.85^2.

109^2=11881.

2*109*0.85= 218 *0.85=185.3.

0.85^2=0.7225.

So total is 11881 +185.3 +0.7225=12067.0225.

But our target is 12059.3384, which is between 109.8^2 and 109.85^2.

Let me compute 109.81^2: as earlier, I think it's about 12058.2361.

Our target is 12059.3384.

So the difference is 12059.3384 -12058.2361=1.1023.

Each additional 0.01 in x adds approximately 2*109.81 *0.01 =2.1962 per 0.01. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me compute 109.81 + delta)^2 = 12059.3384.

We have 109.81^2 ≈12058.2361.

So, (109.81 + delta)^2 = 12058.2361 + 2*109.81*delta + delta^2 = 12059.3384.

We can ignore delta squared for small delta. So, 2*109.81 * delta ≈ 12059.3384 - 12058.2361 =1.1023.

So delta ≈1.1023/(2*109.81) ≈1.1023/(219.62)≈0.005.

So E_mu is approximately 109.81 +0.005=109.815 MeV.

Wait, but wait—this seems a bit confusing. Let me just accept that E_mu is approximately 109.81 MeV.

Now, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c², which is 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Wait, because the rest energy is m_mu c², so the kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy.

So KE_mu ≈4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p*c, which in our units is p=29.78 MeV/c *c =29.78 MeV. So its kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is all kinetic.

So the two kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → no.

B)7.2, 32.8 → no.

C)3.52, 20.8→ no.

D)4.12,29.8 → yes.

Oh, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Which matches our calculations.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the initial equation setup. Let me go back.

Wait, when I set up the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p.

Yes, that's correct because for the neutrino, E = pc (since m=0).

So, when I solved for p, I got p≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but when I compute E_mu, I did sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2) = sqrt(887.45 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.94) ≈109.81 MeV.

Right, then KE_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Which matches option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me check the calculation of p again. Because when I did the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Wait, perhaps I should have used more precise numbers.

Given that m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

So, the equation is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p =139.6.

Let me rearrange it as sqrt(p^2 +105.7^2) = 139.6 - p.

Then square both sides:

p^2 +105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

So,

2*139.6 p =139.6^2 -105.7^2.

Compute 139.6^2 -105.7^2.

Hmm, 139.6^2 is (140-0.4)^2 =140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2=19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

So 2*139.6 p=8315.67.

So p=8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67/(279.2)= let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 *29.7 = ?

279.2*20=5584.

279.2 *9=2512.8 → 5584+2512.8=8096.8.

279.2 *0.7=195.44 → 8096.8+195.44=8292.24.

So 29.7 *279.2=8292.24. The difference between 8292.24 and 8315.67 is 23.43.

Now, 23.43 /279.2 per 0.1.

23.43 ≈279.2 *0.084 → because 279.2 *0.08=22.336, 279.2 *0.004=1.1168 → 22.336+1.1168=23.4528. Close to 23.43.

So p≈29.7 +0.084=29.784 MeV/c.

So p≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(886.8484 +11172.49 )= sqrt(12059.3384 )= 109.81 MeV.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is 109.81-105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p=29.78 MeV, which is its kinetic energy.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches approximately.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the \(\pi^+\) is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), and the rest mass of the \(\mu^+\) is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless.

### Key Equations:
1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the \(\pi^+\):  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_{\mu}\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_{\nu}\)):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
   \]  
   where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).  
   For the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu},
   \]  
   since the neutrino is massless.

### Solving for \(p_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\mu}\):
From conservation of energy:  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2} + p_{\mu} = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(X = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2}\). Then:  
\[
X + p_{\mu} = 139.6.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
X = 139.6 - p_{\mu}.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p_{\mu})^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p_{\mu}^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p_{\mu} + p_{\mu}^2.
\]  
Canceling \(p_{\mu}^2\):  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p_{\mu}.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
279.2 p_{\mu} = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]  
\[
p_{\mu} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Now, calculate \(E_{\mu}\):  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its energy:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = p_{\mu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Matching with Options:
The kinetic energies are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) for the muon and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\) for the neutrino. These values match **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

Answer: D
