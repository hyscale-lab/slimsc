Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking maybe an elimination reaction. Dehydrohalogenation, perhaps? Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons. When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you would form a double bond. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, right, when two vicinal dihalides eliminate, they typically form an alkene. So the product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, maybe it's 1,2-adamantadiene? Wait, no, because the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, maybe? Or wait, no, when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond between those two. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr and form 1,2-diene? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, maybe the elimination forms an annulene? Hmm, maybe I should think about the product's NMR.

The NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H, probably a doublet), then a bunch of multiplets around 2.4-2.2, and 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is from the reaction of a dihalide with KOH. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by oxidation? Wait, or maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, KOH is a base, but sometimes in such reactions, elimination is more likely. Alternatively, if it's a vicinal dihalide, heating with KOH can lead to elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's not just an alkene. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about forming an epoxide? No, because KOH isn't typically used for that. Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH. Let me think about possible mechanisms. Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So we lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond. But then, the product would be an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl peak, which doesn't fit with an alkene. So maybe I'm wrong about that.

Wait a second, maybe it's a substitution reaction. KOH is a good nucleophile, but the structure of adamantane is quite rigid. Maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diol. But then, the IR would show O-H stretching, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But to form an epoxide, you typically would need a peracid or something else, not KOH. So that's probably not it.

Wait another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base, they can sometimes eliminate to form a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that usually requires more specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing some kind of elimination followed by rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. If the dihalide loses two HBr and forms a carbonyl group, that would explain the IR at 1720. How? For that, perhaps a dihalide would eliminate to form a carbonyl. Wait, can vicinal dihalides form ketones? Hmm, maybe through a double elimination. Wait, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, perhaps eliminating both HBr and forming a carbonyl group. So, for example, in a 1,2-dibromoalkane, eliminating two HBr would give an alkene. But if it's a cyclic structure like adamantane, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction and a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but then maybe the OH groups undergo some elimination. Wait, but that would require two elimination steps, which would produce what?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a diepoxide, but I don't think so. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but in adamantane, the bridgehead positions are typically not good for substitution because of the structure's stability. So SN2 is not likely. So maybe elimination is the main pathway.

Wait, another approach: looking at product 1's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone. Wait, but if the product is a ketone, the NMR would show no protons near the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another angle: if the product is a diketone, but the NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether. No, because 4.79 could be an oxygen adjacent CH2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is in excess and heated. Maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, leading to an alkene, but then perhaps the alkene is further oxidized. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition or some ring-opening. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an allene. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should move to the next step and see if that gives me any clues. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is from a dihalide plus base. If product 1 is an alkene, then Friedel-Crafts would require an aromatic ring. But adamantane doesn't have benzene rings. Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone or ester, which could undergo some Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might cause some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But how would that look in the NMR?

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with a Lewis acid might cause ring-opening. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR data again. Product 1's 1H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 peak is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen. The 10H in the multiplet suggests a lot of equivalent protons in a symmetric environment. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 next to an electronegative atom or part of a ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. Or wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary alcohol or ether.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. Because an ester carbonyl is usually higher, around 1740-1760, but a ketone is around 1720. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

So if product 1 is a ketone, then what's its structure? Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr to form a carbonyl group. Oh wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. How? Vicinal dihalides can form ketones via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, for example, if you have 1,2-dibromoethane, you can't form a ketone because it's too short. But in a cyclic structure, maybe it's possible. So in adamantane, eliminating two HBr from vicinal dihalides would form a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two adjacent bridgehead carbons each lose a Br and an H, forming a double bond, but the structure is rigid, so maybe it's a ring contraction leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps upon elimination, the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, so when they eliminate, they form a bridge with a double bond. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then another reaction occurs. But with KOH, perhaps an oxidation is involved. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, with two OH groups on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Then, when heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it forms an epoxide. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane. But that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, but as I thought before, SN2 is unlikely at bridgehead positions. So perhaps elimination is the main pathway, but then how to get a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the process is that each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to an oxide. But then, maybe that would form a cyclic ester or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide, upon heating with KOH, undergoes a double elimination to form an allene and release two HBr. Then, the allene could tautomerize or undergo some other reaction. But I'm not sure if that leads to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I don't think that would explain the IR peak at 1720.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diketone. But in that case, the NMR would have to show more than just a single CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that a bridgehead becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. No, wait, that would have two carbonyl groups. But the IR shows one peak at 1720, so maybe a single ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol ether. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N. So perhaps it's an ether or an alcohol. The 10H in the 2.4-2.2 region could be part of a cyclohexane-like structure, perhaps the bridgehead protons. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group elsewhere.

Wait, considering the IR at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong absorption for a carbonyl group. So the product must have a ketone or aldehyde group. But since it's a solid, maybe it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: product 1's structure. Let me imagine 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is added, elimination occurs. If two HBr are eliminated, what structure would result?

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead double bond. But how would that form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening elimination. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so it's quite rigid. Maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group where one of the bromines was.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O group, but then how would that form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ketone. For example, if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe another way: the product after KOH could be a diol. Then, when heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a dehydration to form an alkene. But that's for product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolysed.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So maybe product 2 is an alkene, and ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the question is about the NMR of product 3. So perhaps product 3 is a diketone or two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Product 1 has IR at 1720, so likely a ketone.

So product 1 is a ketone. How?

Perhaps during elimination, a carbonyl group is formed. Maybe the two bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons are eliminated, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of double dehydrohalogenation. So each Br is replaced by a double bond. But wait, that would require four HBr, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs and two H are eliminated to form a double bond, but that wouldn't give a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But under what conditions? With KOH?

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't give a ketone.

Wait, another approach: the product has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH2)2CO connected in the adamantane framework.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the loss of two HBr and the formation of a ketone. So each Br is on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. So for instance, if each Br is on C1 and C2, eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl, so perhaps C1 becomes a carbonyl, and C2 becomes part of the ring.

Wait, so the product would have a ketone group at one bridgehead, and perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to it. That would explain the 4.79 ppm (2H) as a CH2 adjacent to the ketone.

So for example, the structure could be something like a bridgehead ketone with adjacent CH2 groups.

Then, product 1's NMR would have a triplet or something for those CH2 groups. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.79 is a 2H singlet? Or a doublet? Because the description says 4.79 (2H), but the integration is for 2H. So perhaps it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen or carbonyl.

So product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione? No, it's more likely to have a single ketone group.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that one of the bridgeheads has a carbonyl group. So, for example, the structure might have a bridgehead with a carbonyl and a CH2 group next to it.

Okay, moving on. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, presumably in some reaction to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. In the presence of Lewis acids, Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation can occur, but that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and the Lewis acid is causing some kind of elimination or dehydration.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, what reaction would occur with Al(OiPr)3? Maybe it's a case of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming an enol.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, maybe the Lewis acid is causing it to undergo some kind of cyclization or rearrangement. For example, perhaps it's forming an enol ether or undergoing some elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. Because when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid, it can form an enol ether. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a secondary alcohol, then the Lewis acid might cause it to lose water and form an alkene. But earlier I thought product 1 is a ketone, based on the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. If so, then product 2 could be an ether. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Lewis acid is causing ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at product 3. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So product 2 is an alkene. Therefore, the reaction of product 1 with Al(OiPr)3 must form an alkene. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid causes it to eliminate water and form an alkene.

Wait, but earlier I thought product 1 is a ketone because of the IR. Now, if product 1 is a diol, then the Lewis acid would dehydrate it to form an alkene.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to piece it together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. Product 1 has a ketone (IR 1720) and an NMR with a CH2 at 4.79, a bunch of protons in the 2.4-2.2 range, and another CH2 at 1.94.

So product 1 is a ketone, perhaps with a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which is an alkene. So product 2 is an alkene. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and upon dehydration, product 2 is an alkene. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, not a diol.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, and the Lewis acid causes ring-opening to form an alkene.

Wait, let me think again. If product 1 is a ketone, then how does it form an alkene when treated with Al(OiPr)3? Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol. Then, when heated with a Lewis acid, it would lose water to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Wait, but earlier I thought product 1 is a ketone because of the IR. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in step 1, the dihalide undergoes substitution to form a diol. Then, product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, dehydrates to form an alkene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me check.

So step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → 1,3-adamantanediol (diol). Then, step 2: diol + Al(OiPr)3 → dehydration to form 1,3-adamantadiene (alkene). Then, step 3: ozonolysis of the alkene gives product 3, which would be two carbonyl compounds.

But wait, let's check the data. Product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which in the diol case would be the OHs, but OH protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm as broad peaks. But in product 1's NMR, the 4.79 is probably not OH. Alternatively, if the diol is in a different environment, perhaps the protons are more deshielded.

Wait, but the product 1's IR at 1720 doesn't fit with a diol. Diols don't have a carbonyl. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. So step 1: elimination of two HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to form a ketone. Then, step 2: ketone treated with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that typically involves carbocation shifts. Alternatively, perhaps it forms an enol, which might then tautomerize back. But how would that form an alkene?

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is subjected to some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But ketones don't typically eliminate unless under strong acidic conditions, perhaps forming enones.

Wait, another angle: the initial product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by some reaction. Ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond, which would imply that it's an alkene, formed from product 1.

So perhaps product 1 is a diol, which then dehydrates to form an alkene (product 2). But earlier, the IR suggested a ketone. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. Then, the IR would have O-H peak, but the data says 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the ozonolysis part. Ozonolysis of product 2 (which has a double bond) would give product 3, which has carbonyl groups. So in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each carbonyl group is formed. So if the double bond in product 2 is symmetric, product 3 would have two equivalent carbonyl compounds. Otherwise, it would have two different ones.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So perhaps the structure is such that a proton is adjacent to a carbonyl group and has neighboring protons.

Wait, let's imagine the structure.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups attached to CH2 groups or something similar.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene (a conjugated diene), then ozonolysis would cleave each double bond. Wait, but ozonolysis of a diene typically gives two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a single alkene, leading to two carbonyls.

But perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2. So the most deshielded proton would be on a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

In such a case, the hydrogen would be split by neighboring Hs. Let's say the structure is (CH2)2CO.

Wait, but more accurately, if the ozonolysis produces a compound like CH2(CO)R, then the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would couple with neighboring protons.

Wait, let me think about the coupling. For example, a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl would have two protons. Each of these protons would be split by neighboring protons. If the adjacent group is another CH2, then each H would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet. But wait, if the neighboring group has more Hs, the splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would be adjacent to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, let me think about an example. Suppose we have a structure like CH2-CO. Then, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, like CH2-CH2-CO. The protons on the first CH2 would be next to the CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each would have a triplet. But wait, if the adjacent group is a CH2 with two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the case of being between two CH2 groups, like CH2-CH2-CO, the first CH2 would have each H split by the two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would be a triplet. Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another group with more protons, like a CH2CH2, then the splitting would be more complex.

Another scenario: if the structure is CH2-CO-CR2, then the CH2's Hs would couple with Hs on adjacent carbons, perhaps leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. So each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded H. The deshielded H would be the one closest to the electron-withdrawing group, like the carbonyl.

So in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl would be attached to a CH2 group. That CH2 group's Hs would be deshielded and would couple with neighboring Hs.

Suppose each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2. So for each H in the CH2 next to the carbonyl, they would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is such that the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, like CH2-CH2-CO, then the first CH2 would have each H split by the two Hs in the middle CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, perhaps with branching, the splitting could be more.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl is part of a larger group, leading to more coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the product after ozonolysis is a diketone, with each ketone attached to a CH2 group. So the structure would be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alkene typically results in two carbonyl groups. So if the alkene is in the middle, you'd get two carbonyls connected via the broken bond.

Wait, for example, ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2 gives two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, like CH2-CH2 with a double bond between them, it would break into two carbonyls.

Wait, but in the case of a cyclic alkene, ozonolysis would open the ring.

So let's say product 2 is a bicyclic alkene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups, each attached to the adjacent carbons.

In the case of product 3, each carbonyl would have a CH2 group attached. So each CH2 would have two Hs, which are adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps other Hs.

Wait, the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. So let's imagine the structure is (CH2)2CO. The CH2 closest to the CO would have Hs that are split by neighboring Hs.

Wait, if the structure is (CH2)2CO, then the CH2 adjacent to CO would have each H coupling with the two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be triplet.

But wait, perhaps there are more couplings. If the CH2 next to CO is also adjacent to another CH2 that's branching off, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is between two other groups, leading to more coupling.

Wait, in the product 3, the coupling of the most deshielded H would depend on the number of adjacent Hs. For example, if it's a CH2 group with two Hs, each H would couple with the neighboring Hs.

Wait, another scenario: if product 3 is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2 group which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, each H would couple with Hs from both adjacent groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 that's next to a CH group. So each H would couple with the Hs on the CH group, leading to a doublet of doublets or similar.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard to say. Let me try to think of a possible structure.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone connected to a CH2 group. So the structure would be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Wait, but that would imply a four-carbon chain, which is unlikely in adamantane's framework.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged structure, so each ketone is on a bridge, leading the CH2 groups to be adjacent only to each other.

In that case, each CH2 would have two Hs, each coupling with the two Hs on the other CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 group is next to another CH2 with two Hs, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, perhaps the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2 group would have each H coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would see four neighboring Hs (two on each side), leading to a quartet (but that's a 4-way split, so a quartet). But the options don't have a quartet; the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH group. So each H would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs), leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH2-CH2 group, each H would see four neighboring Hs, leading to a quartet, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So each H on the central CH2 would be split by the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the number of Hs on each adjacent group. So each H would be a triplet for each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, that would be a doublet of triplets if coupled to two different sets, but in this case, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets if each H is coupled to two groups, each with two Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is between two CH2 groups. So for each H on the central CH2, they would couple with two Hs on the left and two Hs on the right. So each H would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a nonet, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, which is itself next to a CH3 group. So each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and three Hs on the CH3. But that would lead to a more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, but the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the H is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs, each with two Hs, then the pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled to two Hs on one side and three on the other, it could be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a situation where it's adjacent to a CH group and a CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH2X)-CO. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (CH2X) and the one H on the CH group. So each H would split into (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which is a sextet. But that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: the CH2 is next to a CH2 group, which is next to a CH group. So each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and one H on the CH group. So each H would have (2+1)*(1+1) = 6 peaks, a sextet, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

The most deshielded H is next to a carbonyl. Let's imagine it's a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is connected to another group with more Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the adjacent group is a CH2 which is itself adjacent to another CH2, leading to each H on the first CH2 being split by four Hs, which would be a quartet. But since that's not an option, perhaps it's a triplet.

Wait, another approach: the coupling pattern depends on how many neighboring Hs are present. If the H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2 with two Hs, then each H would be a triplet. That would fit option A.

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is not directly connected, but perhaps in a different arrangement, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO. Then, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH group's H, which has two Hs. So each H would be a triplet (from the CH group's Hs) and perhaps another coupling from another group.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Given the options, I think the most common scenario is that the H is on a CH2 next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the option B is triplet of triplets. So perhaps it's coupled with two different sets of two Hs each. For example, if the H is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H would have a triplet from each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two adjacent Hs and another set of two adjacent Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, given the options, I think the correct answer is B) triplet of triplets.

The problem involves analyzing a multi-step organic reaction sequence to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, undergoes a reaction with KOH at 240°C. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41–2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggests a rigid structure consistent with adamantane derivatives. The reaction likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone.

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) through dehydration or rearrangement. The exact mechanism is not explicitly clear, but product 2 must contain a double bond, as it undergoes ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is expected to be adjacent to a carbonyl group and influenced by neighboring protons.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring protons. If the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group with two protons, the coupling would result in a triplet. However, if the CH₂ group is coupled to two different sets of protons (e.g., from adjacent groups), the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is best described as a **triplet of triplets**, consistent with coupling to two distinct sets of protons.
