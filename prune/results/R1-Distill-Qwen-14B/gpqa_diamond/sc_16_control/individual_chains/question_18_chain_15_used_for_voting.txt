Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's, but I don't know if the mass affects the ratio of elements here. The problem is about their photospheric compositions, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant unless it affects other factors like temperature or pressure, but I think the question is purely about the abundances given.

The given abundances are in terms of dex, which I remember stands for decimal exponent. So, [X/Y] is log base 10 of (X/Y ratio compared to the Sun). Right, so [Fe/H] being 0 means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. Similarly for [Mg/H]_2 being 0.

Wait, let me parse the data:

Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H.

Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg/Si is 10^0.3 times solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So Mg abundance relative to H is same as Sun.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si/Star_2]/[Si/Star_1] or something like that? Or wait, no— the ratio of silicon atoms would be [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, but I'm not sure. Wait the question says 'ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2'. So Star_1's Si divided by Star_2's Si.

But to get their abundances, I think I need to express [Si/H] in both stars, then find the ratio.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Hmm, wait that notation is a bit confusing. Let me think: The solar photosphere's composition is given by 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) equals some value, like 7.5 for Fe and 7 for Mg.

Wait, n_X is the number density of element X. So, for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 −12 → log10(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Because usually, the solar abundance is given as log(n_X / n_H) + 12 = log(N_X / N_H) where N is number per unit volume? Oh, right, because in astronomy, sometimes they use N_X = n_X × volume, but perhaps that's not the case here. Maybe the given formula is 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) = value, so for Fe, that would be 7.5. So subtracting 12, log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, but how does that help us with the stars? Let's see.

Starting with Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Wait, but wait, H in the star and H in the Sun— are their H abundances the same? Or does [Fe/H] being 0 mean that the ratio Fe/H is the same as in the Sun. So if the Sun's Fe/H is solar, then Star_1's Fe/H is the same. But wait, what about the total H?

Wait, perhaps [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe abundance relative to H) compared to solar. So [Fe/H] = log( (Fe/H)_star / (Fe/H)_sun ). So if [Fe/H] is 0, then (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun → so star and sun have same Fe to H ratio.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe/H is same as Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, in the Sun, nH_sun is the number density of hydrogen. So in Star_1, the number density of Fe is the same as in the Sun relative to H.

But in Star_1, the [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun ) =0.3.

So, (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun is (nSi_sun / nFe_sun). So (nSi1 / nFe1) = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But since nFe1 = nFe_sun × (nH1/nH_sun) × (nH_sun /nH1) ? Wait, no. Wait, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) × nH1.

But nH1 is the hydrogen number density in Star_1, which we don't know. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps we can express the ratios in terms of the solar ratios.

Wait, let's try to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Because the ratio of Si atoms in each star is [Si/Star_2]_Si / [Si/Star_1]_Si = ([Si/H]_1 / [H]) * ([H]/[Si]_2) )? Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, the ratio (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 / nH2) would be (nSi1 / nH1) × (nH2 / nSi2) ) → [nSi1/nH2] / [nSi2/nH1]. Hmm, not sure if that's the way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H] for each star.

So for Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log ( (nSi1 / nFe1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun) × (nH1 / nH_sun) × (nH_sun / nH1) → wait, no. From [Fe/H]_1=0, we have (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) × nH1.

Similarly, nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) × nH1 × 10^0.3 ?

Wait, let's think again.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi1 / nFe1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) =0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun ) * nH1.

So nSi1 = (nFe1) * (10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)) ) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun * nH1 ) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = (nH1 /nH_sun) *10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

So, nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

But we can write nSi1/nH1 = (10^0.3 * nSi_sun) / nH_sun.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = log( (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) = log(10^0.3) = 0.3. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Wait, that's an important point. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so [Si/H]_1 is 0.3. So the abundance of Si relative to H is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

Now for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).

So from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

So,

(nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2 = nSi2 * 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Divide both sides by nSi2:

(nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2 /nSi2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Multiply both sides by nH_sun/(nMg_sun) and multiply both sides by nSi2:

nH2 /nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * (nH_sun/nMg_sun) )= 10^0.3 * (nH_sun/nSi_sun) ) → because (nMg_sun cancels out).

So, (nH2/nSi2) =10^0.3 * (nH_sun / nSi_sun) → which is (nH2/nSi2) = (nH_sun/nSi_sun ) × 10^0.3.

So, nH2/nSi2 = (nH_sun /nSi_sun) × 10^0.3 → (nSi2 /nH2) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) × 10^(-0.3).

So, [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi2/nH2) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) = log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ×10^(-0.3)) ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) → the (nSi_sun /nH_sun) terms cancel, leaving log(10^-0.3) → which is -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Wait, that's helpful. So Star_1 has [Si/H] = +0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H] =-0.3.

So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is ( [Si/H]_1 ) / ( [Si/H]_2 ) ?

Wait, no. The ratio of their silicon abundances would be (nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) = ( [Si/H]_1 + 1 ) / ( [Si/H]_2 + 1 )? Wait, perhaps not. Let's think in terms of actual numbers.

Wait, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) → it's the logarithm of the ratio (nX/nH) / (nX_sun/nH_sun) )= (nX/nH) * (nH_sun/nX_sun) ) = [nX * nH_sun ] / [nH * nX_sun ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express (nSi1 /nH1 ) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^{ [Si/H]_1 }.

Similarly, (nSi2 /nH2 ) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^{ [Si/H]_2 }.

So the ratio (nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) ) = [ (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3} )) ] = 10^{0.6}.

Wait, because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So 10^0.3 /10^(-0.3) =10^(0.6)= approx 3.98. So the ratio is about 4.

But wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] × (nH1/nH2) ).

Wait, because (nSi1/nH1) is [Si/H]_1 above solar, but wait, nH1 and nH2 might be different. Oh, this complicates things! Because the H abundance could vary.

Wait, but wait, in Star_1 and Star_2, [Fe/H] is 0 and [Mg/H] is 0, respectively. So for Star_1, Fe/H is same as Sun, which implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → but that doesn't directly tell us about nH1. Similarly, in Star_2, nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But if we can relate nH1 and nH2, perhaps we can find the ratio of nSi1 and nSi2.

Alternatively, perhaps the H number density doesn't affect the ratio because it cancels out. Let me see.

The ratio of silicon atoms is (nSi1 /nSi2 ) = (nSi1/(nH1)) × (nH2/(nSi2)) ) = ( [Si/H]_1 + solar ) / ( [Si/H]_2 + solar ) ) × (nH2/nH1).

Wait, but we don't know nH1 and nH2. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 is 0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = nSi_sun/nH_sun ×10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → nSi2/nH2 = nSi_sun/nH_sun ×10^{-0.3}.

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) )= [10^0.3 /10^{-0.3} ] =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But the actual ratio of nSi1/nSi2 is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1) × (nH2/nH2) ) ? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si atoms is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) × (nH2/nH1) ) = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH2/nH1) ).

But without knowing the ratio of H in the stars, this seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the H number densities are the same in both stars. But why would that be the case? Because the stars have different masses, but their photospheres might have different H abundances, perhaps due to different formation histories.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate nH1 and nH2 via other abundances.

Wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

In Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But without additional info, we can't directly relate nH1 and nH2.

Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the H density ratio can be found using the photospheric ratios of Fe and Mg?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall metallicity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H density ratio is 1, meaning nH1 =nH2. But that's an assumption; the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, but the problem says "using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars." So perhaps the EW method gives the abundance ratios relative to H, so [X/H] is the logarithm of (X/H) relative to the Sun.

Wait, if that's the case, then for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun. So nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But without knowing how H varies between the stars, I can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH1 and nH2 in terms of each other through another element's abundance.

Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe/H is same as Sun. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So nH1 = (nFe1 ×nH_sun ) / nFe_sun.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun → nH2= (nMg2 ×nH_sun ) /nMg_sun.

But I don't have any data about nMg2 or nFe1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the star isn't directly relevant, but the photospheric composition is what matters. Let's try to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si atoms is (nSi1 /nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1) × (nH2/nH2) ) → I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio.

Star_1: [Si/H] =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = nSi_sun/nH_sun ×10^0.3.

Star_2: [Si/H] =-0.3 → nSi2/nH2 = same ×10^{-0.3}.

The ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) × (nH2 /nH1).

Which is (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) × (nH2/nH1) =10^{0.6} × (nH2/nH1) ).

But without knowing nH2/nH1, I can't find this ratio.

Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si in the two stars is [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] = ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) → but I don't think so. Because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → difference is 0.6 → but that's the log of the ratio.

Wait, because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) =0.3.

Similarly for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = -0.3.

So, the ratio of (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )=10^{0.3}, and (nSi2/nH2)/(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )=10^{-0.3}.

So, (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}.

So, (nSi1/nH1 ) = 10^{0.6} × (nSi2/nH2).

But the ratio of Si atoms, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) ) × (nH2/nH1 ).

Wait, this brings us back to needing nH2/nH1.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same. Because if both stars have the same H abundance, then nH1 =nH2.

In that case, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the answer would be about 4, which corresponds to option A (~3.9).

But why would the H abundance be the same? Because both stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero, but that doesn't necessarily imply the same H abundance.

Wait, but perhaps in the case of [Fe/H] being zero, the overall metallicity is the same as the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is zero, perhaps the H abundance is the same as the Sun, but that's not necessarily the case because [Fe/H] could be zero due to same Fe and H abundances, but H could be higher or lower.

But without more data, perhaps the only way to proceed is to assume that the H number density is the same in both stars, which might not be correct, but perhaps that's the intended approach.

So, if nH1 =nH2, then nSi1/nSi2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero imply that the overall metallicity is solar, meaning that nH is the same as the Sun's, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the Sun's nH is given as part of the photosphere composition. So perhaps in Star_1, nH1 is same as Sun's nH, because [Fe/H]_1 is zero.

Wait, let's see: [Fe/H]_1 is zero → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → which implies that nFe1 =nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

But to have nFe1 =nFe_sun, nH1 must be same as nH_sun.

Wait, because nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 =nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

If nH1 =nH_sun → nFe1 =nFe_sun → which is consistent with [Fe/H]_1=0.

So in Star_1, nH1 is same as the Sun's.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 =nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

If nH2 =nH_sun → nMg2 =nMg_sun.

But without more info, we can't say nH2 is same as nH_sun. But wait, perhaps in Star_2, nH2 =nH_sun as well.

Wait, but then if both nH1 and nH2 are same as the Sun's, then the ratio nSi1/nSi2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the answer would be option A, ~3.9.

But wait, the problem doesn't state that the H abundance is the same in both stars. Only that [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero. So perhaps Star_2 has a different H abundance.

Hmm, but this is getting too complicated, and I'm not entirely sure. However, in the absence of more information, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the H densities are the same as the Sun, leading to the ratio being 10^0.6.

So, the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is closest to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → (nSi₁/nFe₁) = 10⁰.³ × (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe₁/nH₁) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → (nMg₂/nSi₂) = 10⁰.³ × (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (nMg₂/nH₂) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log₁₀(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log₁₀(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10⁻⁴.⁵.
   - 12 + log₁₀(nMg/nH) = 7 → log₁₀(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10⁻⁵.

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Determine [Si/H] for each star.
- **Star_1**:
  - From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, (nFe₁/nH₁) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun).
  - From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, (nSi₁/nFe₁) = 10⁰.³ × (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).
  - Combining these, (nSi₁/nH₁) = 10⁰.³ × (nSi_sun/nH_sun).
  - Thus, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

- **Star_2**:
  - From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, (nMg₂/nH₂) = (nMg_sun/nH_sun).
  - From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, (nMg₂/nSi₂) = 10⁰.³ × (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).
  - Combining these, (nSi₂/nH₂) = 10⁻⁰.³ × (nSi_sun/nH_sun).
  - Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

#### Step 2: Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms.
- The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\right)} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
  \]
- From [Si/H] values:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}, \quad \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\right)} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
  \]
- Assuming the hydrogen number density ratio \( \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 1 \) (since no information suggests otherwise), the ratio simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
  \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A
