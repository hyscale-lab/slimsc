Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm supposed to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, so I'll need to analyze those first to figure out what Compound X is.

Let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably from O-H or N-H bonds. But considering the other IR peaks, I think it's more likely an O-H stretch since the other options don't have nitrogen. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so there's definitely an aromatic ring present.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. Let me list out the peaks:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often indicates an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. If it were an alcohol, the peak might be around 1-5 ppm, but 10.5 is really high, so I think it's a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets suggest that there are two sets of equivalent protons, probably on a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Like, maybe a substituent on one carbon and another on the opposite, making it 1,4-disubstituted.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe from a CH adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen in a ketone or ester, or perhaps part of a substituent group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons in a multiplet. Maybe part of a chain attached to the ring, like a CH2 group next to another CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, three protons. That suggests a CH3 group attached to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Maybe a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isobutyl group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, three protons. This is likely a terminal methyl group, maybe part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted. The substituents are likely a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and another group. Let me think: the carboxylic acid would explain the 10.5 ppm peak. Then, the other substituent is probably a side chain.

Looking at the NMR shifts, the substituent on the ring must have a branching because of the 1.4 ppm doublet and 1.7 ppm multiplet. Let's imagine the structure. If there's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4, one being a COOH group and the other a branching chain.

So, maybe the structure is something like benzoic acid with a substituent on the para position. The substituent would have a chain leading to a methyl group. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), so that's a CH3 connected to a CH that's split into a doublet because it's adjacent to another CH.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm multiplet is 1H, maybe a CH connected to something else. If I have a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring, that might fit. Let me visualize: the ring has COOH at position 1 and a substituent at 4. The substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, perhaps part of a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a propyl chain or something similar. Let's think: the substituent starts from the ring as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-something. But wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet is another CH3, which would be the end of an ethyl group. So, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a branching point.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, a sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)-CH2- attached? Wait, no, sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw this.

The substituent attached to the benzene ring is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a isobutyl group. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H): that's a CH3 attached to a CH. So, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group connected to a CH2. So, the structure would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Then, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, probably the two protons on the CH2 next to the benzene. Then, the 2.9 ppm is the CH that's connected to the CH3 and the CH2. So, that could be a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring.

Wait, but then where does the 0.9 ppm triplet come in? That's a CH2CH3 group. So, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a methyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, where the CH(CH3) is attached to the ring. So, the substituent is CH2CH(CH3), but then where's the 0.9 ppm triplet? Hmm, maybe the substituent is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent attached to the benzene ring is a propyl branch that includes a methyl group.

Wait, let me try to outline the substituent. The substituent is probably a butyl group, because the NMR shows signals that suggest a chain with a methyl and a terminal ethyl group.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH2. The 2.9 ppm is 1H, which could be a CH connected to both the benzene and a CH2. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl attached to a CH.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. But wait, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me think about the NMR for that.

So, the isobutyl group would have a central CH connected to two CH3 groups and another CH2. Wait, but the NMR shows a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), then a CH (2.9 ppm, 1H), and then a CH3 (1.4 ppm, 3H) as a doublet. Also, the 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, is there an ethyl group attached to the substituent? Because the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which is typical for a CH3 connected to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group, but I don't think so because the NMR doesn't have the typical multiplets for that.

Wait, perhaps the group is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- something. Let me try to map the NMR signals:

- The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is the end of an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. So, that's probably the end of a chain.

- The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) would be the middle CH2 in a longer chain.

- The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH connected to the ring and another CH2.

- The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH.

So, perhaps the substituent is a chain like: benzene ring attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group with a branch. Let me count the protons:

Wait, benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH that has a CH3 and a CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, think of the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. Like, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but let me think about the structure of the substituent. Let's think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. But I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me consider the molecular formula. The NMR data gives us the following:

- 10.5 ppm (1H): likely a carboxylic acid proton.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each 2H): so four aromatic protons, meaning a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

- The other signals: 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). So, that's 1+2+3+3 = 9 protons, plus the aromatic 4 protons, and the carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but the 1H NMR only accounts for 1+2+3+3+4+1=14 protons. But that's the total in the molecule. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the 1H NMR tells us how many protons are present. Let's add up:

10.5 ppm: 1H

8.0 ppm: 2H

7.2 ppm: 2H

2.9 ppm: 1H

1.7 ppm: 2H

1.4 ppm: 3H

0.9 ppm: 3H.

Total is 1+2+2+1+2+3+3 = 14 H. But the molecular formula would be CxHyOz. Wait, but the exact formula isn't given, so perhaps I should focus on the structure.

Let me try to reconstruct the structure. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one position and another substituent at the para position. The substituent is an alkyl group with a branching.

The substituent's structure seems to have a CH(CH3) group. Because of the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), perhaps it's a CH connected to a CH3 (doublet) and another CH2.

Wait, here's an idea: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but where does the 0.9 ppm triplet come in?

Wait, maybe the substituent is longer. Let me think: benzene ring attached to a CH2 which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a CH2CH2CH3. No, that would be a pentyl group with branching.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would have 4 carbons, making it a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Let me see:

- The substituent would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the substituent would be as follows: benzene ring attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, the NMR would have the following:

The CH2 next to the ring (let's say that's the first CH2) would have two protons. The CH(CH3) would have one proton (the 2.9 ppm peak), and the CH3 would be a doublet because it's attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, doublet, 3H). The next CH2 (after the CH(CH3)) would have two protons, perhaps around 1.7 ppm, and the final CH3 (from the ethyl group) would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, that sounds like a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, but that's more like a pentyl group. Wait, no, the butyl group is four carbons. So, the substituent is:

Benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3?

No, that's five carbons, which would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a 3-pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Let me see:

The substituent would be benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any singlet for a C(CH3)2 group. Because if it were a C(CH3)2, the protons on the adjacent CH2 would be split into a triplet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, the NMR for that substituent would have:

- The CH3 at the end (CH2CH3): 0.9 ppm, triplet (3H).

- The CH2 next to it (CH2-CH(CH3)): maybe around 1.3 ppm as a triplet, but in the given data, there's a 1.7 ppm multiplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to piece together the structure again.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, so it could be a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broad and around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is covered in the 3400–2500 region mentioned. So, yes, compound X is a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring.

So, structure of X is a para-substituted benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent. The substituent is an alkyl group with a branching, as indicated by the NMR.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably a CH connected to two different groups, perhaps a CH that's part of a branching.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): adjacent to the CH, maybe a CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of an ethyl group.

So, the substituent is a chain that goes from the benzene ring through a CH, then a CH2, then a CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group. But with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, maybe the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent would be a four-carbon chain with branching.

Let me map the NMR again with a sec-butyl group:

The substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that's four carbons in the substituent. The NMR would have:

- Benzene ring: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (para-substituted).

- COOH: 10.5 ppm.

- The substituent: the CH2 next to the ring (let's say that's the first CH2, maybe around 2.5 ppm or so?), but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H. Hmm, maybe that's the CH.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent structure wrong. Let me think about the substituent.

The substituent is connected to the benzene ring. It has a CH2 group (from the NMR), then a CH (with a CH3 and another CH2), then a CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's a pentyl group with a methyl branch. But the NMR doesn't show all the expected peaks for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a butyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon, making it a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, so the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 next to the ring: maybe around 2.5 ppm, but in the data, we have 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That seems more like a CH attached to two different groups. So, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-. No, that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH (2.9 ppm, multiplet).

- The adjacent CH2 (1.7 ppm, multiplet).

- The terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet).

Wait, that might fit. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring. But where is the CH3 at 1.4 ppm?

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. There's a CH3 attached to a CH, which would explain the 1.4 ppm doublet. So, maybe the substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)(CH3)-. Wait, that would be a CH with two CH2 groups attached. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, putting it all together, I think the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But then where is the terminal CH3? Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's a pentyl group, but let's see the NMR.

The NMR would show:

- The CH3 at the end (CH2CH3): 0.9 ppm, triplet.

- The CH2 adjacent to that (CH2-CH(CH3)): around 1.3 ppm, perhaps a triplet or multiplet.

- The CH(CH3) would have one H, at around 2.1 ppm or so, but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet.

Hmm, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 next to the ring: maybe around 1.5 ppm, but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet.

- The CH would be at 2.9 ppm, perhaps.

Wait, but in that case, the CH(CH3)2 would have two CH3 groups attached, which would be a singlet. But the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, not a singlet. So that might not fit.

I'm a bit stuck, so perhaps I should pivot and think about the reaction.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Thorpe reaction, which is a substitution reaction. Alternatively, HI is a strong acid and can lead to the cleavage of certain groups.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the cleavage of carbonyl groups, particularly in the Baeyer-Villiger cleavage, but more commonly, I think they are used to cleave ketones to form alcohols. Alternatively, when a ketone is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes cleavage to form two alcohols.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Another possibility: HI and red phosphorus can be used to reduce a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction, but that uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, not HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, another reaction: When a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can convert the carboxylic acid group into an alkyl iodide. Wait, but how?

Oh, wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. If X is a benzoic acid derivative, reacting with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of benzyl iodide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not about the COOH group, but about some other functional group. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so it's either a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if X is a ketone, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would cleave the ketone. But if X is a carboxylic acid, maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another thought: If X is a benzoyl chloride, but the IR doesn't show a peak for that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, then undergoing some substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes via the Wittig reaction, but that typically involves triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If X has a good leaving group adjacent to the aromatic ring, HI could substitute it. But looking back, the substituent is an alkyl group attached to the ring, so maybe it's an alkoxy group that's being substituted, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. If X is a β-keto acid, then heating with phosphorus and HI could lead to decarboxylation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a side chain that has a carbonyl group, and the reaction is cleaving that.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which ones fit.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, let's see. The starting material X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The product is one of these.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, same as the starting material, but perhaps the substituent is changed.

Wait, but the reaction would have to modify the substituent. Let me think: If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction converts that substituent into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a ketone next to the COOH group. For instance, if X is a benzoyl ketone, like Ph-CO-R, then the reaction would break the carbonyl, leading to Ph-R and CO2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, so perhaps the reaction doesn't change the COOH group but modifies the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's structure changes.

Wait, if X is 4-(something)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts that substituent into another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation or some kind of elimination.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which could correspond to an aromatic ring, and 1450 cm-1, which might be a conjugated double bond or C-O stretching. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Let me try to think of the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Thorpe reaction, which is a cleavage of ketones. The Thorpe reaction cleaves a ketone into two alcohols. So, if X has a ketone group, then the reaction would break it, forming two alcohols.

But in the NMR and IR data, there's a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or a carboxylic acid. If it's a ketone, then the reaction would break the carbon chain.

But looking at the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is not about cleaving a ketone.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzoyl chloride, but the IR doesn't show a peak for that. Alternatively, maybe X is a benzophenone derivative, but the NMR doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or something, then HI would substitute it.

But in the NMR data, there's no indication of a leaving group. So, perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group, but I don't see an oxygen peak in the IR besides the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a decarboxylation. If X is a β-keto acid, then heating with red phosphorus and HI would remove the CO2 and form an alkane.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent. For example, reducing a ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, but if X is a ketone, then the reaction would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. Then, the product would have an -OH group, which might show up in the NMR.

But looking at the options, I don't see any alcohols listed. The options are either acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an iodide. But that would require activating the carboxylic acid, perhaps converting it to an acid chloride first, but the reaction conditions don't seem to support that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a COOR group, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to COOH. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, that's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Assuming X is 4-(some group)benzoic acid, and the reaction transforms the group into a sec-butyl.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a halogen is replaced by an iodide. But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but I don't see any Mg in the reagents.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI might lead to the formation of an acyl iodide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out the structure of X first.

X has an aromatic ring, a carboxylic acid group, and a substituent with a branching.

The substituent appears to be a chain that goes from the ring to a terminal CH3, with a branching point. The NMR suggests that substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isoamyl group. An isoamyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but let me think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's a pentyl group with a methyl branch.

But the NMR data only shows 3H at 0.9 ppm (triplet), which is the CH3 at the end. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH(CH3). The 2.9 ppm (1H) is the CH attached to both the CH3 and the adjacent CH2. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is the CH3 attached to the CH.

So, this substituent would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon: Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's five carbons, which would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, with a branch on the second carbon. So, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But that's four carbons, making it a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3: 0.9 ppm, triplet.

- The CH2 adjacent: 1.7 ppm, triplet.

Wait, no, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, which suggests it's next to a branching.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that would have the following NMR:

- 0.9 ppm: triplet (CH2CH3).

- 1.7 ppm: multiplet (CH2 adjacent to CH(CH3)).

- 2.9 ppm: multiplet (CH(CH3)).

- 1.4 ppm: doublet (CH3 attached to CH).

Wait, that actually fits!

So, substituent structure: Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch, but the substituent is attached to the benzene ring as Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which would be the two protons on the CH2 next to the CH(CH3). The 2.9 ppm is the CH, which is connected to the CH3 (1.4 ppm) and the CH2 (1.7 ppm). The 0.9 ppm is the terminal CH3.

So, that structure fits. Therefore, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon, making it a isoamyl group (CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, isoamyl is (CH2)2CHCH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps it's a isoamyl group. The isoamyl group is -(CH2)2CHCH(CH3). But in that case, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, no, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that substituent's NMR would have:

- The CH2 next to the ring: around 1.5 ppm, perhaps as a triplet.

- The CH attached to two CH3 groups: around 1.0 ppm as a singlet for the CH3 groups, but in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet.

Hmm, perhaps not matching.

Well, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed to the reaction.

Once I have the structure of X, which is 4-(something)benzoic acid, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI will transform it into something else.

Assuming X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction converts that substituent.

But without knowing the exact substituent structure, it's tricky.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzoic acid.

If X is, say, 4-(something else)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts that to a sec-butyl group, then option C would be the product.

But I'm not sure how the reaction would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a carbonyl group, and the reaction reduces it to an alcohol, but I don't see how that leads to any of the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the COOH group is removed, and the substituent is modified. For example, if the substituent is a ketone, decarboxylation would produce an alkane.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the substituent. If the substituent is a ketone, the Thorpe reaction would cleave it into two alcohols. But again, without knowing the substituent's structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a propyl group with a methyl branch, and the reaction doesn't affect the substituent, so the product is the same as X. But that's not one of the options except for C.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, perhaps X is that, and the reaction doesn't change it. But that would mean the reaction is perhaps a catalyst or something, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's end is changed.

Another approach: since the product options don't have a COOH group except for option C, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group. So, the reaction affects the substituent, converting it into a different group.

Wait, assuming the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it loses a part of the chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction cleaves it, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Baeyer-Villiger cleavage, which cleaves ketones into two carbonyl compounds. But in this case, if the substituent is a ketone, the reaction would break it.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If X is a benzoyl chloride, the IR would show a peak around 1800 cm-1, which it doesn't. So, more likely, it's a carboxylic acid.

So, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent is modified.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's leaving group is replaced by iodide. But without a leaving group in the substituent, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But that doesn't align with the IR.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing the COOH group. If X is a β-keto acid, then the reaction could decarboxylate it, forming a substituted benzene.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para position. So, maybe the reaction converts the COOH group into a methyl group.

But how?

Wait, the reaction between a β-keto acid and red phosphorus and HI can lead to decarboxylation, forming an alkane. So, if X is a β-keto acid (like Ph-CO-C(OH)R), the reaction would remove the COOH group and form Ph-CH2-R.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a propyl chain with a methyl branch. The reaction could cleave the chain, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, replacing the COOH group with a iodide, but I don't see that matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, turning the COOH into a CH2OH group, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another thought: the carbonyl group (COOH) is a carboxylic acid. Red phosphorus and HI might not react with that, unless the compound has a different functional group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. If X has a leaving group (like a nitro group), then HI and red phosphorus could substitute it, but I don't see that in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, and the reaction converts it into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide or iodide which is substituted. But without that information, it's hard.

Hmm. I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean that the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzoic acid. So, if X is that, and the reaction doesn't change it, then the product is the same. But the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so I would expect a change.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into something else. For example, if the substituent is a ketone, it's cleaved into two alcohols.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

How could that form from a benzoic acid? Perhaps if the COOH group is reduced to a methyl group. But how?

Red phosphorus and HI might not be the typical reagents for that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that's usually with metals like Na and NH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't think red phosphorus is a catalyst for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group. But that would require some kind of nucleophilic substitution, which isn't typical for carboxylic acids.

Wait, but if the COOH group is activated as an acid chloride, then substitution with HI would replace it with iodide. But the reaction conditions don't include such activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But then X would have a ketone, which would require a different NMR and IR.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to match the options with the reaction.

If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent and the reaction converts the substituent into a methyl group, then the product would be a toluene derivative. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a 1,4-dimethylbenzene with a sec-butyl group.

But how does that form from X?

Wait, perhaps the substituent in X is a longer chain, which upon reaction is cleaved to a methyl group. For example, if the substituent is a pentyl group, the reaction could cleave it to a shorter chain.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a propyl group with a methyl branch, and the reaction reduces it to a shorter chain.

Hmm. Another approach: think about the number of carbons. The NMR shows a total of 14 H, which suggests a certain molecular formula. But without knowing the formula, it's hard.

Wait, the product options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's C11H14O2.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's C11H14.

So, if X is option C, then the reaction would have to remove two oxygens, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is option C, and after reaction, the product is D, which doesn't have the COOH group.

But how would that happen? Maybe decarboxylation.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then perhaps the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) decarboxylate it, converting the COOH group into a methyl group.

Decarboxylation of a β-keto acid would release CO2 and form an alkane. So, if X is a β-keto acid, like Ph-CO-CO-R, then decarboxylation would give Ph-CH2-R.

But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, so Ph-CH2-(sec-butyl)? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group to CH2OH, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the steps I've taken.

Given the substituent in X is a pentyl group with a methyl branch, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction that shortens the substituent.

If the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the reaction might cleave the chain to form Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-I, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction replaces the COOH group with a methyl group, leading to a toluene derivative.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given the options, and considering the reaction conditions, I think the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But this would imply that the reaction doesn't change the substituent, which is possible if the reaction is not affecting the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts X into option C, meaning X was a different compound.

Hmm. I'm not confident, but perhaps the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Compound X is characterized by IR and NMR data, which indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), an aromatic ring, and a substituted alkyl chain. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group), and 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data confirms the presence of a para-substituted benzene ring, a carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm, and signals for a substituted alkyl chain.

The NMR signals for the alkyl chain suggest a branching structure: a CH group at 2.9 ppm (multiplet), a CH₂ group at 1.7 ppm (multiplet), a CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm (doublet), and a terminal CH₃ group at 0.9 ppm (triplet). This indicates a substituent such as a pentyl group with a methyl branch or a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are known to facilitate cleavage of carbonyl groups or substitution reactions. However, the IR and NMR data suggest that the carboxylic acid group is not cleaved but remains intact. The reaction likely modifies the substituent on the benzene ring. Based on the options provided, the substituent is identified as a sec-butyl group, and the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, matches the structure inferred from the data and the reaction conditions. The reaction does not appear to alter the carboxylic acid group but may modify the substituent to form the sec-butyl group.

Answer: C
