Okay, so I've got this question about a metric in general relativity, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that in relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. Here, it's written in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a two-dimensional space?

Wait, no, because in general relativity, metrics are often for four-dimensional spacetimes, but this seems to be a two-dimensional one. Like maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in higher dimensions or something. But I'm not sure. Let's focus on the problem.

The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is like the surface you get when you have a metric with negative curvature. So the area of a pseudosphere... wait, but wait, isn't the area of a sphere 4πr²? But for a pseudosphere, I don't know. Maybe it's similar but with hyperbolic functions.

Wait, the metric given here might be a representation of some kind of hyperbolic space. Let me look at the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Hmm, 4 is (2)^2, so 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r², where r² is x² + y². So the denominator is 4 - r².

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). So this looks like a conformally flat metric, where the spatial part is scaled by a factor. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²). Wait, but 4 - r² can be written as (2)^2 - r². Oh, that's similar to the metric for the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole, but wait, no, Schwarzschild is for four dimensions. Here, it's two-dimensional.

Wait, another thought: the metric might be representing a space with a certain curvature. The standard metric for a space of constant curvature in two dimensions is usually written in terms of radius. For example, in spherical coordinates, the metric is (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - k r²), where k is the curvature. Or maybe something like that.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to see what kind of geometry we're dealing with. Because the area of the pseudosphere would depend on that.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in terms of the metric is given by the determinant of the second fundamental form divided by the first fundamental form, but another approach is to compute it from the metric components. Since the metric is conformally flat, perhaps it's easier.

The general form for a 2D metric in conformal coordinates is ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), where φ is some function. Comparing, our metric here is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so φ = ½ ln(32/(4 - r²)), but wait, maybe that's not the simplest approach. Alternatively, I can compute the Ricci scalar, which in 2D is proportional to the Gaussian curvature.

The Ricci scalar R for a 2D metric ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ² (in polar coordinates) is given by R = - (1/(2g)) [ (dg/dθ)/(r²) + (1/r) (d²g/dr²) + ... ] Wait, perhaps I should look for a better formula.

Alternatively, for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is - (1/(2 r f²)) [ (df/dr) (1/r) + (f'(r)/r²) ] Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the Gaussian curvature K is given by - (1/(2 f)) [ (d^2 f)/(dr^2) + (1/r) (df/dr) ) ] when the metric is in the form ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, but our metric is written in terms of x and y. Let me switch to polar coordinates because it's easier for computing curvature. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So, f(r)^2 = 32/(4-r²), so f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = (4√2)/sqrt(4 - r²).

Wait, no, 32 is 16*2, so sqrt(32)=4√2, so f(r) = (4√2)/(4 - r²)^½.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by the formula:

K = - (1/(2 f)) [ (d² f)/(dr²) + (1/r) (df/dr) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's correct. Let's compute f(r):

f(r) = 32/(4 - r²) → wait no, because in the metric, it's [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So f(r)^2 is 32/(4 - r²), so f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using another formula. Alternatively, I remember that for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [ (B'/(2 B)) - (A')/(2 A) ) ] / sqrt(A B)

Wait, I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, maybe using the formula:

K = [ (1/(2 A)) (d/dr ( (A B) (1/r) )) ) ] 

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, I can compute it using the general formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates.

Wait, another approach: in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/2) (ln A)'' where A is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, for a metric ds² = A dx² + 2 B dx dy + C dy², the Gaussian curvature is:

K = [ (C_x - B_y) ] / (A C - B² )

Wait, but in our case, the metric is diagonal, so B=0, A = C = 32/(4 - r²) in polar coordinates, so perhaps K is [ (A_y - B_x) ] / (A C - B² ), but since B is zero, it's (A_y)/ (A² ), because A = C.

Wait, but in polar coordinates, expressing x and y as functions might complicate things. Maybe it's better to compute the Christoffel symbols and then find the curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for K in terms of the conformal factor.

Wait, if the metric is conformally flat, like ds² = e^{2 φ} (dx² + dy²), then the Gaussian curvature K is related to the Laplacian of φ. Specifically, K = - e^{-2 φ} Δ φ, where Δ is the flat-space Laplacian.

In our case, φ is (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)). Because the metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²) = e^{2 φ} (dx² + dy²) where e^{2 φ} = 32/(4 - r²). So, φ = ln( sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) ) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

So, φ = (1/2) ln(32) + (1/2) ln(1/(4 - r²)).

Wait, but the Laplacian in 2D is ∇² φ = (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr).

Let me compute that.

First, compute dφ/dr.

dφ/dr = (1/2) * [ (0)/(4 - r²) ) - ( -2 r )/(4 - r²) ) ] → Wait, φ is (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

So, dφ/dr = (1/2) [ ( derivative of numerator )/(denominator) - numerator*(derivative of denominator)/(denominator²) ) ] Wait, no, more carefully:

Let me write 32/(4 - r²) as 32 (4 - r²)^(-1).

So, ln(32/(4 - r²)) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

So, φ = (1/2) ( ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

So, the derivative of φ w.r. to r is:

dφ/dr = 0 - (1/2) * ( derivative of ln(4 - r²) )

Which is dφ/dr = - (1/2) * [ ( -2 r ) / (4 - r²) ) ] 

Simplify that:  ( -1/2 ) * ( -2 r ) / (4 - r²) = (r) / (4 - r²).

So, dφ/dr = r / (4 - r²).

Now, the Laplacian in 2D is (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr).

So,

First, compute r dφ/dr = r * [ r / (4 - r²) ) ] = r² / (4 - r²).

Then, take derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ].

Using quotient rule:

Numerator derivative: 2r (4 - r²) + r² * 2r, over (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, the derivative of [r²/(4 - r²)] is [ (2r)(4 - r²) + r² * (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, the general derivative of u/v is (u'v - uv')/v².

Here, u = r², v = (4 - r²).

u' = 2r, v' = -2r.

So,

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (2r)(4 - r²) + r² (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, wait, no, because v' is negative. So it's [2r*(4 - r²) - r²*(-2r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

So that becomes [2r(4 - r²) + 2 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Expanding the numerator:

2r*4 =8r; 2r*(-r²)= -2 r^3; plus 2 r^3.

So, 8r -2 r^3 + 2 r^3 = 8r.

So, the derivative is (8r) / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Laplacian is (1/r) * [8r / (4 - r²)^2 ) ] = 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

So, ∇² φ = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - e^{-2 φ} ∇² φ.

Because φ is such that e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²), so e^{-2φ} = (4 - r²)/32.

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify that:

(4 - r²) in numerator cancels with (4 - r²)^2 in denominator, leaving (4 - r²)^-1.

So,

K = - [ (1/32) * 8/(4 - r²) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

K = - (8)/(32 (4 - r²)) ) → 8/32 = 1/4.

So, K = - [ 1/(4 (4 - r²)) ) ].

Wait, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Gaussian curvature of a metric. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe there's a simpler approach.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 4 - r². So when r approaches 2, the denominator goes to zero, which would make the metric singular. That suggests that the maximum radius is 2, beyond which the metric becomes undefined. So perhaps the pseudosphere has radius 2 in this context.

But wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. In 2D, a pseudosphere can be thought of as a surface where the Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere. So in this metric, perhaps the curvature is negative, which would make it a pseudosphere.

Wait, but in the calculation I did earlier, the Gaussian curvature came out as K = -1/(4 (4 - r²)), which is negative for r < 2, because denominator is positive. So that's consistent with a pseudosphere.

But wait, the question is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, but wait, wait. The radius r in the metric is the coordinate r, but in general, the radius of curvature in a pseudosphere is different. Wait, perhaps I should think about the area in terms of the metric.

Wait, the area is computed as an integral over the surface. The metric's line element is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So, the area element is dA = sqrt( g ) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant g is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) ) = (32/(4 - r²))^2.

Wait, no, in 2D, the determinant is (A)(C) - B², where the metric is A dr² + 2 B dr dθ + C dθ². In our case, A = 32/(4 - r²), B=0, C = (32/(4 - r²)) r².

Wait, no, wait, in polar coordinates, the metric is:

ds² = A dr² + C dθ²,

where A = 32/(4 - r²), and C = [32/(4 - r²)] r².

So the determinant is A * C - B² = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32 * 32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but the area element in 2D is sqrt( determinant ) dr dθ. So,

sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) dr dθ = (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So, the area is the integral over r from 0 to 2 (since beyond r=2, the metric breaks down), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So, the area would be:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ (32 r)/(4 - r²) ) ] dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. The integral over θ is just 2π, so:

A = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ) / u ].

So,

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du

= -16 ln |u| + C

= -16 ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluated from 0 to 2:

At r=2: ln(4 - (2)^2)= ln(0) → which is -infinity.

At r=0: ln(4 - 0) = ln(4).

So,

Integral from 0 to 2 is [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ] → which is [ 16 * ∞ ] + 16 ln(4). Which is infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. So the area is infinite? But that's not possible for a pseudosphere. Or is it?

Wait, no, a pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface of finite area but infinite length. Wait, but perhaps in this case, the area is divergent.

Wait, but the integral I did is from r=0 to r=2. Let's check the behavior near r=2.

As r approaches 2 from below, the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero. So the integrand behaves like [32 r]/(4 - r²) → which for r near 2 is approximated by [32 * 2 ]/(4 - (2)^2) → 64/(something approaching zero). So the integrand goes to infinity as r approaches 2.

Thus, the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is divergent. So the area is infinite.

But wait, the options include D) +infty, so the area would be infinite, which is option D.

But wait, why is the area infinite? Because the pseudosphere is non-compact and extends infinitely, but in this case, the radius is 2, so perhaps the coordinate r goes up to 2, but the surface actually extends infinitely in some way. Or maybe because the metric breaks down at r=2, making it a horizon or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the radius. The question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". The pseudosphere's Gaussian curvature is constant and negative. The Gaussian curvature K is related to the radius of curvature R by K = -1/R². So if K is negative, R is the radius of curvature, which would be R = 1/√|K|.

Wait, but earlier, I found K = -1/(4 (4 - r²)), which depends on r. That can't be right because Gaussian curvature should be constant for a pseudosphere. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in calculating K.

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach to calculating K was incorrect. Let me try another method.

Another way to compute Gaussian curvature is using the formula for a metric in polar coordinates: ds² = e^{2 φ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ²). Then the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - e^{-2 φ} [ (d φ/d r) * (1/r) + (d² φ)/(dr²) ) ]

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Alternatively, another approach: using the formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric components.

In 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be computed using the formula:

K = (1/(2 √(g))) [ (∂_r (g_{θθ} / (2 √(g))) ) ] where g is the determinant.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula that for a metric ds² = A dr² + B dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [ (d/dr) (sqrt(A B) ) / r ) ] / sqrt(A B)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I can look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the given metric is similar to the metric of a two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. Or perhaps a conformally flat metric with a specific curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is π r² (but that doesn't seem right, because for a sphere, it's 4π r²).

Wait, but no, a pseudosphere is a surface with infinite extent, so perhaps its area is indeed infinite. But when I calculated the area, I found the integral diverges, which would mean the area is infinite.

So, looking back at the options, option D is +infty, so that would be the answer.

But wait, the options also include B) and C) which are 4π(x² + y²) and 4π(x² - y^2), but these seem to be functions of x and y, which wouldn't make sense for the area of a pseudosphere. Because the area should be a scalar, not a function of position.

Wait, the question says, what's the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So the area should be a number, not a function. Therefore, options B and C, which are functions of x and y, can't be correct. So the only possible answers are A) 0, D) +infty.

But wait, why would the area be zero? That wouldn't make sense. So the area must be infinite, hence option D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions, where the conformal factor is \( \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \), with \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). The metric becomes singular at \( r = 2 \), as the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) approaches zero. This suggests that the geometry is defined only for \( r < 2 \), and \( r = 2 \) acts as a boundary.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element in polar coordinates. The metric in polar coordinates is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The determinant of the metric is:

\[
g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \ln|u| + C = -16 \ln(4 - r^2) + C.
\]

Evaluating from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \):

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \left[-16 \ln(4 - r^2)\right]_0^2 = \left[-16 \ln(0)\right] - \left[-16 \ln(4)\right].
\]

As \( r \to 2 \), \( \ln(4 - r^2) \to \ln(0) \), which diverges to \( -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges, and the area is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: This is incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)** and **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: These are functions of \( x \) and \( y \), but the area should be a scalar, not position-dependent. Hence, these are incorrect.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: This is correct, as the integral for the area diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

**Answer: D**
