Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, especially in the context of the Hofmann elimination. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! When you have a tertiary alkyl halide reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's more about eliminating HX and forming alkenes. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent here, often used in deoxygenation or maybe in the formation of alkenes via elimination.

But wait, another thought: red phosphorus is sometimes used in the context of the Wittig reaction, but that typically involves triphenylphosphine and aldehydes/ketones. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation. So, the reaction is probably an elimination reaction leading to the formation of an alkene.

Now, looking at the IR and NMR data for Compound X to find out its structure. Let's break down the IR first.

IR Data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: That's a broad region, likely O-H or N-H stretch. But the strong peak in this region is probably an O-H. Wait, but another possibility is an aldehyde's O-H (but aldehydes usually have a sharp peak around 2800-2700 for the C-H stretch in the aldehyde group). Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol O-H, but the broadness suggests maybe an acidic O-H like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the presence of a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3300 and a strong C=O around 1700. So, 1720 is a bit higher, which could also be an acid chloride, but that's less likely here. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, but let me think: 1720 is more typical of an ester, perhaps. Or a ketone, but a ketone's C=O is around 1715, maybe a bit lower. Alternatively, an acid chloride is higher, like 1800, so maybe 1720 is an ester.

Wait, but the problem states that after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the product is one of the four options, which includes benzoic acids and substituted benzene rings. So perhaps the starting compound has a benzene ring with some substituents and an ester or similar group.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong shift. A broad singlet around 10 ppm is indicative of an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But the integration is 1H, which fits for either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. Hmm. Let me think more.

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300 and a strong C=O around 1700. The IR given has a strong peak at 1720, which is in line with a carboxylic acid (1700-1725 cm-1). So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But then the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which matches the -COOH proton.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring, with a substituent at the para position. But then the other substituents would be... let's see.

Wait, the NMR also has peaks at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents, perhaps a meta or para arrangement. Wait, no, if it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but here it's two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests that the benzene has substituents in the para positions, making two sets of doublets. For example, a substituent at positions 1 and 3 might give a doublet for each set. Wait, no, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, with substituents at 1 and 4 positions. Wait, but the doublets would be for each pair of equivalent protons. Oh, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene with one substituent, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. Wait, no: if it's a substituent that's in the para position, and another substituent in the ortho position, then maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that is itself a group with two protons, so that the aromatic ring is disubstituted in the para positions, leading to two sets of doublets.

Wait, but perhaps the aromatic ring is substituted with another group, such as a methyl group or an ethyl group or a propyl group, but let's see.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, perhaps from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe CH2 groups adjacent to another CH or something.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, suggesting a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a doublet, like a CH2 group. For example, a CH(CH3) group where the CH is next to another CH2.

And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, probably part of an ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a propyl group, maybe branched. For example, a benzene ring attached to a propyl group that's branched, like an isobutyl or sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituents on the benzene ring. The two doublets in the aromatic region suggest a para-disubstituted benzene. So, for example, if the benzene has a substituent at position 1 (like a COOH group) and another substituent at position 4, which would be para to position 1.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

But let me think about the NMR of that structure.

The aromatic protons would be as follows: if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, that would leave positions 2,3,5,6. Let's think about the substituents. The benzoic acid has a COOH group at position 1. The substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group. So, the benzene would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that structure, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. Because the substituents are at 1 and 4, the ring is para-substituted. The H in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent and form a doublet (coupled with H in positions 3 and 5), and similarly H in positions 3 and 5 would form another doublet. But wait, maybe their coupling constants are similar, leading to two doublets each integrating for 2H. So that would match the NMR data: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Also, the downfield shift for the higher upfield positions may be due to the substituents.

Wait, but the carboxylic acid would have a proton at 10.5 ppm (bs), which matches the NMR data.

So, the structure of Compound X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but wait: the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So if Compound X is a benzoic acid, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, benzoic acid is an acid, so it might react with HI in a way. Wait, but when red phosphorus is present with HI, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but benzoic acid is a strong acid, and HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the reaction. Red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for the elimination of HX, especially in the case of tertiary alcohols or other structures where elimination is favored. For example, the Hofmann elimination involves a quaternary ammonium salt and a strong base to eliminate and form an amine, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, I remember that when you have an ester, such as RCOOR', treating it with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is being converted into its corresponding acid chloride, but that would require a different reagent, like thionyl chloride. Alternatively, maybe it's not an acid but an ester. But wait, looking back, the initial data from IR and NMR might suggest that.

Wait, let me re-examine the IR data. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be at around 1720-1740 cm-1. But if it's a ketone, maybe lower.

Wait, but the presence of a broad peak in the IR between 3400 and 2500 cm-1, which could be the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. So, it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

So if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI?

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an acid anhydride or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the benzoic acid is being converted into an acyl chloride, but that's not typically done with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, maybe the benzoic acid isn't the starting structure. Let me think again. Perhaps the IR and NMR data suggest a different structure.

Looking at the NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Then, the 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone or an ester, but maybe more likely a ketone. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde, the IR would show a strong peak around 2800-2700 cm-1 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch. The given IR doesn't mention any peaks in that region, though.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, so the structure is a benzoic acid as I thought before.

Wait, but how does a benzoic acid react with red phosphorus and HI? Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but Friedel-Crafts typically uses a Lewis acid like AlCl3 and an acyl chloride. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is being converted into an acyl chloride with HI and red phosphorus, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X isn't a benzoic acid but an ester. Let me think: if the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl, which could be an ester. Then, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, it could be a ketone, but then the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Let's say it's an aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. So the structure would be benzaldehyde or a derivative. But then the IR would show a peak around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde's C-H, but the given IR doesn't have that. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a phenolic O-H, but that's usually broader and in a different region. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, and the IR's broad peak is the O-H. Then, the 1720 cm-1 is the C=O of the acid.

In that case, Compound X would be a benzoic acid with substituents. Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each a doublet integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 4.

If the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would match the NMR data.

So the reaction is Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacting with red phosphorus and HI. What reaction occurs here?

Wait, benzoic acid is an acid. When you treat it with HI, perhaps it would undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. Wait, but red phosphorus is a reducing agent. I'm a bit stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X isn't a benzoic acid but an ester. So, perhaps the structure is an ester. Let's think: if the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, that's typical of an ester. The broad peak at 3400-2500 could be from an alcohol, but if it's an ester, maybe there's an -OH group elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR shows 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which could be from an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's the ester's R group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something else. Let me try to deconstruct the NMR again.

The aromatic protons are 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene, with substituents at positions 1 and 4. So, for example, the substituents could be a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and something else at position 4.

The other signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Possibly a carboxylic acid proton.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Perhaps a CH group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group next to another CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group. For example, a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is next to a CH2 group. So that would suggest a structure like CH2CH(CH3)- attached to something.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal CH3, like the end of an ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what reaction would occur. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. For example, in the case of esters, red phosphorus can help in the cleavage of esters to form acids and alcohols. But wait, the starting material is already a benzoic acid. Alternatively, maybe the starting material isn't an acid but an ester, and the reaction is hydrolyzing it.

Wait, but if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and we're adding HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the acid is reacting with HI in an acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not sure what that leads to.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of Compound X. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't a carboxylic acid. Let's think of another possibility. Let's try to build the structure step by step.

Looking at the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be an aldehyde, but without a peak in the IR around 2800, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4.

The substituent at position 1 is likely the functional group (like COOH), and position 4 is another substituent, perhaps a branched chain.

The other NMR peaks suggest a chain structure. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether or ester. Alternatively, it's a CH next to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is then attached to another CH group. So, perhaps it's a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, no. A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) would suggest that the CH3 is attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH group. For example, something like CH2-CH(CH3)-X, where X is another substituent.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

So, putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring at position 4 could be a propyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)2). Wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Or perhaps it's a butyl group, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Wait, an isobutyl group would be CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's a tertiary butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a tert-butyl group, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) doesn't seem to fit that. A tert-butyl group would have a central CH connected to three CH3 groups, which would have a triplet or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way. Let's think about the substituent as a propyl group, perhaps a 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. But the NMR data suggests branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached as a secondary carbon. For example, a CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent structure. The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, so likely an ethyl chain. So, the substituent would have an ethyl group. Let me think. If the substituent is a propyl group, the ethyl would be part of a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Let me try to draw it out.

Suppose the substituent is -OCH2CH(CH3)2, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2CH2 group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me see. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3). But then the NMR would have peaks for the CH2 groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction again. If the starting compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, maybe the benzoic acid is being converted into an acyl chloride. But red phosphorus and HI are more about elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an alkene.

Wait, another thought: if the benzoic acid has an adjacent alcohol group, perhaps it's an ester. But I don't see any O-H stretches in the IR except the broad one, which could be the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the elimination of HX from a molecule. For example, in the case of tertiary alcohols, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can form an alkene via the E1 or E2 mechanism.

Wait, but the starting material is a benzoic acid. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is an alcohol group that's adjacent to a carbonyl, such as in an ester. Wait, but in that case, the IR would show a peak for the ester carbonyl, which is around 1720 cm-1, which matches.

So if Compound X is a phenyl ester, like phenyl propionate or something, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but the NMR data for the aromatic region suggests a substituent at position 4, so perhaps the ester is attached there.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzyl ester, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a terminal CH3, as in an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group. So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is itself attached to something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. For example, a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene ring. But the NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm, which might be in the middle of a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think about a butyl group: an ethyl group attached to a propyl chain. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the reaction. If Compound X is an ester, perhaps it's something like methyl benzoate. But then the NMR would show a singlet for the OCH3 group, which isn't present here.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via an oxygen, like an ether. But I don't see any peaks in the NMR that would suggest an ether, like a triplet around 3.5 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene via a carbonyl group, as in an aryl ketone. But then the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which matches the IR. But then the NMR would have a different set of peaks, maybe a CH3 attached to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain attached directly to the benzene ring without any oxygen or nitrogen.

But given the substituent's NMR data, I'm starting to think that the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, such as a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent's structure. The substituent is at position 4 of the benzene ring. The substituent has a CH2 group that's connected to a CH group, which in turn is connected to a CH3 and another CH2 group.

Wait, that sounds like a sec-butyl group: CH2CH(CH2CH3). But wait, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)2, which is an isobutyl group. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, whereas sec-butyl is (CH3)CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents. Let me clarify:

- Isobutyl group: -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene via a CH2, which is attached to a CH that's connected to two CH3 groups. The NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 next to the benzene, perhaps around 1.4 ppm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, a sec-butyl group would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, wait, correct substituent structures:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3
- isobutyl: -CH2CH(CH3)2
- sec-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, no. The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl group, making it a branched structure. But I'm not getting it.

This is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the structure, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do what? Maybe it's a protection or elimination reaction.

Wait, but benzoic acid is a good leaving group in certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into an acyl chloride. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI are typically used for that. Usually, you'd use thionyl chloride or phosphorus oxychloride.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But benzoic acid is a poor leaving group unless activated. Maybe if it's an ester, then the ester could undergo cleavage.

Wait, but if the starting compound is a benzoic acid, I'm not sure how HI would react with it. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the reaction is hydrolyzing it. But that would produce a carboxylic acid, which is what the starting material already is.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the structure of Compound X. Let me try to reevaluate.

Another approach: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows an aromatic ring with substituents leading to two doublets. The other substituents include a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is perhaps adjacent to the aromatic ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CH3. But then the NMR would show peaks for the OCH2 group, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl group, making it an acyl group. So, the substituent would be a propionyl group, but that would be R-CO- attached to the benzene.

But in that case, the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which fits, and the NMR would show the CH2 and CH3 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. But I don't see such peaks in the NMR. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to the carbonyl, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH3 attached to a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl, making it an acyl group, and the molecule is benzoylpropyl or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with branching. The NMR suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH2, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, making it a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. That would fit the NMR data.

In that case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached at position 4, and the substituent at position 1 is a carboxylic acid group. So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, as in option C.

Now, what happens when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Let me think about the possible reactions of benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. HI is a source of H+ and I- ions. When red phosphorus reacts with HI, it can form PH3 and I2. But how would that affect the benzoic acid?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the benzoic acid is converted into an acyl iodide. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the benzoic acid's substituent is a good leaving group. If the substituent is a propyl group attached via an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CH3, then treatment with HI could lead to cleavage, forming an iodide. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached directly to the benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure how that would work with the substituents.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of an ester. Suppose the starting material is an ester, say, ethyl benzoate. Treating it with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of the corresponding acid and an alkene. But that's a possibility. But in that case, the IR would show the ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and the O-H stretch of the acid (broad around 2500-3300).

So, if the starting material is an ester, the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But then the product would be the acid, which is already present in the starting material. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

I think I'm stuck because I can't reconcile the reaction conditions with the structure. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If Compound X is that, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a reduction. But red phosphorus isn't a strong reducing agent for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, but I don't see how the benzoic acid would lead to elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol, but that doesn't fit the options. None of the options show an alcohol.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached at position 2.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting material is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that can undergo elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a bromo group, and the reaction is elimination. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a alkoxy group, and the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are sometimes used in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. So, perhaps Compound X has a structure with a leaving group, such as a bromide, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would eliminate to form an alkene.

But in the NMR data, I don't see any peaks that would suggest the presence of a bromine or a leaving group. So, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a propyl group with a bromide at the end. Then, reaction with HI would cause elimination. But again, the NMR doesn't show any peaks that suggest Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a substituent that can eliminate upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The key here is to figure out the structure of Compound X and then determine what the reaction does.

From the NMR:

- The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, so substituents at positions 1 and 4.
- The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.
- The rest of the NMR suggests a substituent with a CH3 at the end, a CH2 group, and a CH group.

Putting this together, the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group, making the structure 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction: treating this acid with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not entirely sure about this, but perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed formation of an acyl iodide. But I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but on what part of the molecule?

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester. If the substituent were an ester, like O-CO-R, then the reaction with HI could lead to hydrolysis. But if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached directly to the benzene, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the dehydration of the benzoic acid to form a benzene ring with a carbonyl group. But that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI might reduce the carbonyl group. So, if the starting material is a benzoic acid (which has a carbonyl), the reduction would convert it into benzyl alcohol. But none of the options show an alcohol group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride, but I'm not sure about the reagents leading to that.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the possible products.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a substitution, but I can't see where the substitution would occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent on the benzene ring but affects another part of the molecule. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the other group is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, which would eliminate CO2 and form a compound with a double bond. For example, if the substituent is a group that can form a double bond upon decarboxylation, then the product would have a double bond.

But wait, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Decarboxylation would require a β-hydrogen, which I don't think is present here. Because the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a hydrogen adjacent to the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait: in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituent is at position 4, which is para to the COOH group. So, the structure is:

COOH
|
Benzene ring with substituent at position 4: -CH2CH(CH3)2?

If the substituent is a secondary alkyl group, like a sec-butyl, then the molecule would have a β-hydrogen, which could allow for decarboxylation upon heating, but I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would induce that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group. But HI is a strong acid, and maybe the carbonyl would react with it. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but I don't think that's the case with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols. If that's the case, the carboxylic acid would be reduced to a primary alcohol.

Wait, that's a possibility. If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). But looking at the options, I don't see a product with a primary alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl to a methylene group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but I don't see a leaving group in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the elimination of HX from certain compounds, such as alcohols or esters, to form alkenes.

In this case, if the substituent on the benzene ring is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group (sec-butyl), perhaps the reaction is causing elimination from that substituent, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So, maybe the substituent is a secondary alkyl group, and upon treatment with HI, it undergoes elimination. So, the sec-butyl group would lose HX (maybe HI) to form an alkene.

Wait, but the substituent attached to the benzene is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, that's a tertiary carbon. So, in that case, elimination would require a hydrogen on a neighboring carbon. But the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2. The CH2 is attached to the benzene ring, and the next carbon is CH(CH3)2. So, the neighboring carbon is the CH group. But that CH group is attached to two CH3 groups and the CH2 connected to the benzene. So, perhaps there's a hydrogen on the CH2 group.

Wait, but in that case, elimination would lead to the formation of a double bond between the benzene-attached CH2 and the adjacent CH. So, the substituent would become CH2-CH2(CH3), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent becomes a CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group, and upon elimination, it becomes a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility that the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and upon reaction, it loses HX to form a double bond, leading to a benzene ring with a vinyl group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, and elimination forms a double bond in the chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, and the reaction forms an alkene. For example, if the substituent is CH2CH2CH2CH3, the reaction could form CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in that case, the substituent would become a propenyl group.

But looking at the options, none of them seem to have an alkene substituent except perhaps option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. No, that doesn't involve an alkene.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck, but I think the best approach is to proceed with the structure I've deduced and then see what the reaction would produce.

Assuming Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is an elimination reaction, perhaps forming an alkene. But I'm not sure where the double bond would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply not changing the substituent and the product is the same as the starting material. But that can't be, as the question states that a reaction occurs.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. For example, using a strong reducing agent like red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that would mean the benzene has a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

But the starting material has a carboxylic acid at position 1, so if it's reduced to a methyl group, the substituent at position 1 becomes -CH3, and the substituent at position 4 is the sec-butyl group.

Wait, but the starting material would have the substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). Reducing the COOH to CH3 would give a substituent at position 1 as CH3 and position 4 as sec-butyl, which would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

So, the final product would be option D.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the reduction of a carboxylic acid to a methyl group using red phosphorus and HI. I think that's more of a reaction involving the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but maybe under certain conditions, red phosphorus and HI can act as reducing agents.

Alternatively, perhaps this isn't the correct pathway.

Another possibility: The reaction could be converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the substituent but converting the benzoic acid into something else, but I don't see it.

Hmm.

Another possibility: The reaction could be introducing iodine. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is simply a substitution where the carboxylic acid is replaced by an iodide, but that would require the acid to be a good leaving group, which it isn't usually.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's beyond what I can think of right now.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, I think the most plausible answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but I'm not confident about the reaction's outcome.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are with red phosphorus and HI. Another thought: perhaps the reaction is not affecting the benzene ring but the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a butyl group, the reaction could lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination. So, the substituent would change from a butyl group to a vinyl group.

But in that case, the product would have a double bond in the substituent, but none of the options show that. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromoalkyl group, and the reaction is elimination, but that's not supported by the data.

I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the analysis, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI leads to the reduction of the carbonyl group to a methyl group, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data provided suggest the structure of Compound X, and the reaction conditions help determine the transformation.

### Analysis of IR and NMR Data:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - A broad peak in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** region suggests an O-H stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from CH₂ groups in a chain.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, suggesting a CH₃ group attached to a CH₂.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl or propyl chain.

From this data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for elimination or reduction reactions. In this case, the reaction likely reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃), forming **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. This product has a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4, consistent with the reaction conditions.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the reaction does not introduce a propanoic acid group.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as the substituents and structure do not match the reaction outcome.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Incorrect, as this is the starting material, not the product.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Correct, as the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, resulting in this structure.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
