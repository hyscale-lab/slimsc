Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the synthesis of a specific aromatic compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the target molecule with high yield.

First, I should draw out the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the numbering is 1, 2, 3? Let me think about the structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the nitro group is at position 3, tert-butyl at 2, and ethoxy at 1. Or maybe I should look at the numbering again. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the numbering might not be consecutive. Wait, no, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the ring. So, let me arrange them as positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Wait, no, actually, let's look again. The formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3. So the substituents are adjacent to each other in a way that positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in the ring. Hmm, maybe I should think of the substituents as meta to each other or something else. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the directing effects.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (which is a strong activating, ortho/para director), tert-butyl (a bulky, weakly activating, ortho/para director), and nitro (a strong deactivating, meta director). Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing. So considering that, how are the substituents arranged?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order in which these groups are introduced. The problem is about the sequence of reactions leading to the target molecule. Benzene is the starting material, so the first substituent introduced will determine the positions where the next substituent can be added.

Let me think about the synthesis steps. The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Now, the ethoxy group is an activating group, which would orientate incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions. The tert-butyl is a bulky activating group, also ortho/para directing. The nitro group is deactivating and meta directing.

But wait, the order in which these groups are added is crucial because each new group will direct the next substitution based on its own directing effects.

The target molecule has nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy groups. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's usually introduced last because it deactivates the ring, making further substitution difficult. Wait, but that's not always the case, depending on the directing effects. Or perhaps, it's better to introduce activating groups first to facilitate the introduction of other groups.

Wait, the ethoxy group is a strong activating group. Introducing it first would allow the ring to be highly reactive for the next substitution. But the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so perhaps it's introduced after some activating groups are in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced first. If I start with benzene, introducing nitro would require a nitration step. But nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro. Hmm, but then adding ethoxy or tert-butyl next. Wait, but if I first nitrate, the ring is deactivating, so the next substitution would be harder. So perhaps it's better to introduce activating groups first.

So, let's consider the steps:

1. Introduce ethoxy group (activating, strong, para/ortho director).
2. Then introduce tert-butyl (activating, but bulky, so ortho/para, but steric effects would direct more to para perhaps).
3. Then introduce nitro group (deactivating, meta director). But wait, introducing a nitro group after an activating group would be tricky since the ring is still activated. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, but the directing depends on the other substituents.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro group is at position 3. Let me imagine the positions. Let's say the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the positions are adjacent: 1,2,3. Hmm, but for benzene, 1,2,3 would be adjacent if the ring is numbered that way.

But wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So, the substituents are arranged in such a way that each is adjacent to the others. How can that happen? Because when adding substituents, each new group is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged as 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), making them adjacent in a way that each is next to the others.

But let's think about the synthesis steps. Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

- Start with benzene.
- First, add ethoxy group. How? Probably through an etherification reaction, like using Williamson's synthesis or using an alkyl chloride with a strong base. Wait, no, benzene rings typically undergo electrophilic substitution. So perhaps Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, ethoxy is an ether, so to introduce an -OEt group, perhaps we can do an etherification via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's generally not feasible unless the ring is strongly activated. Alternatively, perhaps we perform a nucleophilic substitution, but that's more common for rings with strong activating groups, like when a nitro group is present, which makes the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, no. For introducing an ethoxy group, perhaps a better approach is to first introduce a leaving group, like a nitro group, then substitute it with ethoxy. But that's more involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can do an electrophilic substitution using an alkyl halide, but that's tricky because alkylation of benzene requires a catalyst like AlCl3, but benzene is not very reactive. Wait, perhaps Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, Friedel-Crafts typically introduces alkyl groups, not ether groups. Alternatively, perhaps we can use an oxygen nucleophile. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the groups involved. The ethoxy group is an activating group, so it's probably introduced early. The tert-butyl group is another activating group, so perhaps introduced next. The nitro group, being deactivating, is introduced last.

Wait, but nitro groups are usually introduced via nitration, which is a substitution reaction. So, maybe first introduce ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, after introducing ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two activating groups. Let's think about the directing effects. The ethoxy group is a strong activating group, ortho/para director. The tert-butyl is a bulky activating group, ortho/para director, but because of steric hindrance, substitution may prefer para positions.

But when multiple substituents are present, the most activating group usually directs the next substitution. Or, the substituents' positions may lead to the next substitution in a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, but then the ring becomes deactivating, making it harder to add other groups. So maybe that's not ideal.

Another approach: think about the order in which the substituents are added. Let's consider the options given and see what each option does.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), v) dilute H2SO4, vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat, vii) NaOH/EtBr (SN2?), viii) Fe/HCl, ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see each step.

Option A:
i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So benzene becomes tert-butyl benzene. Then,
ii) nitration: adds nitro group. Now, the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl and nitro. But wait, the tert-butyl is an activating group, so the nitro would be added in the ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl. Then,
iii) sulfonation with SO3 and H2SO4: introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Then,
iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization, but that's typically for aryl amines. Wait, but if we have a sulfonic acid group, maybe something else happens. Or perhaps it's a nitrous acid reaction in another context.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost here. Let me think. The product after step ii is tert-butyl nitrobenzene. Then step iii is sulfonation. Sulfonation is a reaction where a sulfonic acid group is added. It's an activating group, but since we're adding it to a nitro-substituted ring, the nitro is deactivating, so the sulfonic acid might be added in the position directed by the existing substituents. But this seems a detour because the target molecule doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3/H2SO4; ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, let's go through each step.

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: benzene → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the nitro group is likely added in the ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl: FeCl3 is a Lewis acid, perhaps used in some substitution. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used in the hydrolysis of nitro groups? Wait, no. Fe/HCl is used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but that's done with HCl and Fe, but that's under acidic conditions. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used in some elimination reactions or perhaps for the preparation of a diazonium salt, but that requires low temperatures.

Wait, after step ii, the molecule is tert-butyl nitrobenzene. Step iii: Fe/HCl might be used to convert nitro to amine. But in that case, the nitro group would become an amine. But then, if we have a nitro group in para position, converting it to amine with Fe/HCl would give tert-butyl aniline. Then, step iv is another nitration. Hmm, but that would add another nitro group, which is not present in the target molecule. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) NaOH/EtBr; ix) SO3/H2SO4.

Wait, step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

Step ii: sulfonation → introduces a sulfonic acid group. Now, the ring has two activating groups: tert-butyl and sulfonic acid. But wait, sulfonic acid is a strong activating group? No, wait, sulfonic acid groups are strong activating, but they are meta directors. Wait, no. Actually, sulfonic acid groups are strong activating, ortho/para directors because they are electron-donating via resonance. So, in step ii, the sulfonic acid is added in the para position relative to the tert-butyl group, perhaps.

Then, step iii: nitration. Now, the ring has two activating groups: tert-butyl and sulfonic acid. So, the nitration would add a nitro group where? The sulfonic acid is a strong activating group, so it would direct the nitration to its ortho and para positions. But the tert-butyl is also an activating group. Which group is more directive? Sulfonic acid is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl, so the nitration would be directed by the sulfonic acid group. So the nitro would be added ortho or para to the sulfonic acid.

But wait, in the target molecule, the nitro is present. Let me try to imagine. So, after step iii, the structure would have tert-butyl, sulfonic acid, and nitro groups. Then step iv: Fe/HCl. Again, perhaps this is converting a nitro group to an amine. But perhaps I'm not following the right steps.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3/H2SO4; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm. Step i: nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl. So, converting nitro group to amine? So nitrobenzene → aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → adding tert-butyl group to aniline. But wait, aniline is a strongly activating group. However, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is typically used with activating groups, but aniline itself is a good director. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3. So, adding tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 would introduce a tert-butyl group to aniline, which is already substituted with nitro (now as amine) and tert-butyl.

Wait, but aniline is a meta director, right? Because the amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director but in this case, the ring is already activated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the target structure again. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, considering the synthesis steps, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last because it's deactivating. So, the sequence would be: introduce ethoxy group, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, so perhaps it's best to introduce it after activating groups are already present.

Alternatively, another approach is to perform the nitration after having ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, but in a way that the nitro ends up in the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts, but wait, ethoxy is an ether. Friedel-Crafts alkylation would introduce an alkyl group, not an ether. So perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe using an etherification method. Wait, another method to introduce ethers is via the nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a nitro group is present. For example, using a nitro group as a meta director, then substituting with ethoxy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the steps in the options again, focusing on which substituents are added when.

Looking back, the target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's think about the steps in option D.

Option D: Step i is nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine, so aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → adding a tert-butyl group to aniline. Since aniline is a strong activating, ortho/para director, the tert-butyl would go into ortho or para positions relative to the amino group. But wait, the amino group is in position 1 (if we number that way), then tert-butyl could be in position 2 or 4.

But in the target, the tert-butyl is in position 2, adjacent to ethoxy in position 1 and nitro in position 3. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce the nitro group to amine, getting aniline.

3. Perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group. Since aniline is a strong activating group, the alkylation would occur at the ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group via another Friedel-Crafts? But that's not possible because Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups, not ethers. Alternatively, perhaps introduce ethoxy via another method, like nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2).

The positions are 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2). So, OEt is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are adjacent in a row.

Let me think about the directing effects during each substitution.

Suppose I first introduce the ethoxy group. Let's say I do that via some method. The ethoxy is an activating group, so next substituent would go to ortho or para relative to ethoxy.

Then, I add the tert-butyl group. Since ethoxy is activating, the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Now, assuming ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2 (ortho), then the next substituent, nitro, would be in a position directed by both groups. But nitro is deactivating, so it's best to add it last.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so after adding nitro, any further reactions would be difficult. So, the order would be ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

But how do I introduce the ethoxy group? That's the tricky part. Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces alkyl groups, not ethers.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introduce a nitro group first, then perform a substitution to ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing, and substitution reactions (like nucleophilic aromatic substitution) require a good leaving group, which nitro is not. So that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can introduce a leaving group via nitration, then substitute it with ethoxy. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe the correct order is to introduce the tert-butyl group first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. If I first add tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para), then ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), the next nitration would be directed by the most activating group, which is ethoxy. But nitro is deactivating, so if it's added last, the ring would have two activating groups and one deactivating.

Wait, perhaps I should try to visualize the steps in each option.

Option D: Step iii is adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts to aniline. So, after aniline (from nitrobenzene reduction), adding tert-butyl. Then, step iv is another nitration.

Wait, but adding a tert-butyl group to aniline would make the ring even more activated. Then, nitration in step iv would add a nitro group. But wait, the target molecule has a nitro group, so perhaps that's where it comes in.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target structure again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Let me imagine the order of addition.

First, introduce ethoxy. Then, tert-butyl, then nitro. Or perhaps first nitro, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. But considering the directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then add ethoxy, then add tert-butyl. Or maybe ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but if I first add ethoxy, then add tert-butyl, and then nitro, the nitro would be directed by the ethoxy group.

Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating, so it's better to add it last. So, perhaps the steps are: ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution after nitration.

Alternatively, think about the steps in option D.

Option D's steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → converts nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl group to aniline. Since aniline is a strong activating group, the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

So, after step iii, the molecule is aniline with a tert-butyl group. Then, nitration (step iv) would add another nitro group. But the target molecule only has one nitro group. So maybe this path is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the steps that introduce all three substituents without adding more than needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution. For example, after introducing a nitro group, perhaps displacing a nitro with ethoxy. But that's not straightforward because nitro is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using a nitration followed by a diazonium salt substitution.

Wait, let's think. If I have a nitro group in a certain position, perhaps I can convert it to a diazonium salt and then substitute it with an ethoxy group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, perhaps using a leaving group like a nitro group and substituting it with ethoxy via some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring. For example, if I have a nitro group (deactivating) and a tert-butyl group (activating), the ring might be sufficiently activated in some positions for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking at the target molecule, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy group (position 1) and adjacent to the tert-butyl (position 2). Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, using their directing effects.

Wait, if ethoxy is at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2, then the next substituent (nitro) would go where? The ethoxy is a strong activating group, so it would direct the next substituent to ortho or para. The tert-butyl is also activating, directing to ortho and para.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl. So perhaps the nitro is added in a position that's meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so it's better to add it after the activating groups. So, the steps could be:

1. Introduce ethoxy group.
2. Introduce tert-butyl group.
3. Nitrate.

But how to introduce ethoxy? I'm stuck on that.

Alternatively, looking back at the options, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let me re-examine option D's steps.

Option D:
i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.
ii) Reduce nitro to amine with Fe/HCl → aniline.
iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → introduces a tert-butyl group in ortho or para to the amino group.
iv) Nitrate again → adds another nitro group.
v) Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl → forms a diazonium salt.
vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.
vii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.
viii) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis under acidic conditions.
ix) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, introducing an ethoxy group via substitution.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if that leads to the correct structure.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, such as using an alkyl halide in the presence of a strong base. Wait, but that's more for alkylation, not etherification.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring is activated by other substituents. For example, if the ring has a nitro group and a tert-butyl group, perhaps in certain positions, the ring becomes activated enough to allow substitution with an ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure how that would work. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but as an ether. But I thought Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for introducing ethers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution using a good leaving group, such as a tosylate or mesylate. But benzene rings are not typically good for such reactions unless there's a strong activating group present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced using a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable here.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which one logically leads to the target structure.

Let me take option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Nitro converted to amine (aniline).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl to the ring. Since aniline is strongly activating, the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the amino group.

Assuming it goes ortho, the structure would be 2-tert-butylaniline.

iv) Nitrate again → adds another nitro group. Wait, but the target only has one nitro. Hmm, perhaps this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iii, the tert-butyl is added, and then step iv is nitration, adding nitro group in a position directed by both the amino and tert-butyl groups.

Wait, but after step iii, the amino group is present, and the tert-butyl is added. Nitration would then be directed by the amino group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, the nitro would be added ortho or para to the amino group.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2). So, if the amino group is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, then nitro would be at position 3, which is meta to position 1 and adjacent to 2.

Wait, that seems possible. So, after step iv, the structure would have amino (position 1), tert-butyl (position 2), and nitro (position 3).

Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Converts amino group to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is added. But wait, where? If the diazonium salt is in position 1, and the ring has substituents in 2 and 3, perhaps the sulfonic acid is added in a position directed by the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt undergoes some reaction. Then, step vii is dilute H2SO4, perhaps hydrolysis.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat → maybe decomposes the diazonium salt to a phenol.

Wait, but then step ix: NaOH and EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, introducing ethoxy group via substitution.

But I'm not sure about this pathway. It's getting complicated, and I'm not certain if it leads to the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order of reactions in the options. The target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The nitro is deactivating, so maybe it's introduced last.

Looking for an option where nitro is introduced after ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Looking at option C.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonic acid group added. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and sulfonic acid.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has three substituents: tert-butyl, sulfonic acid, and nitro. But the target only has three substituents, so perhaps this is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps option C is adding more groups than necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce nitro group (HNO3/H2SO4).

2. Reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl).

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl (directed by amine, ortho or para).

4. Introduce ethoxy group via another method.

Wait, but how to introduce ethoxy? Perhaps via a substitution reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 3, the structure is 2-tert-butylaniline. Then, step iv is nitration again, but that would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to count the steps and see which option ends up with the three substituents in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group (ortho to amine).

4. Now, the structure is 2-tert-butylaniline.

5. Introduce ethoxy group. But how? Perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, such as a coupling reaction, but that's beyond my current knowledge.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy group. So, if ethoxy is introduced first, the nitro would go meta to it.

Let me think: benzene → ethoxy benzene.

Then, nitrate → nitro group meta to ethoxy.

Then, add tert-butyl group, which would go ortho or para to ethoxy, but considering the existing nitro group.

Wait, but the nitro is deactivating, so the tert-butyl would be directed by the ethoxy group.

So, if ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3 (meta), and tert-butyl in 2 (ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro). That matches the target structure.

So, the steps would be:

1. Introduce ethoxy group.

2. Nitrate → nitro group meta to ethoxy.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl, which would go ortho to ethoxy (position 2).

But how to introduce the ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts? Wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl groups, not ethers. So, perhaps I should use a different method.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with another group.

For example, after nitration and reduction, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Introduce ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts etherification? No, I don't think Friedel-Crafts does that.

Alternatively, perhaps using an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) after activating the ring with a strong activating group. So, if aniline is present, perhaps we can substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

But I'm not certain about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, which includes steps that introduce nitro, then tert-butyl, and then ethoxy via a substitution.

But I'm not fully confident. I think I've spent enough time thinking, but I'm not entirely sure. Based on the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the aromatic ring. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing, while the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces a tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group to the ortho or para position.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not present in the target molecule.
4. This option introduces an extra sulfonic acid group, making it incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces a tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, directed by the tert-butyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is not present in the target molecule.
4. **Step iv**: Another nitration step adds another nitro group, which is not desired.
5. This option introduces additional groups and does not match the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces a tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not present in the target molecule.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the presence of the sulfonic acid group complicates the directing effects.
4. This option introduces an extra sulfonic acid group and does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces a tert-butyl group, directed by the amine group to the ortho or para position.
4. **Step iv**: Another nitration step adds a nitro group, which could align with the target structure if properly directed.
5. **Step v**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
6. **Step vi**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not present in the target molecule.
7. **Step vii**: Dilute H₂SO₄ may hydrolyze the diazonium salt.
8. **Step viii**: H₃O⁺ and heat could further hydrolyze intermediates.
9. **Step ix**: NaOH and EtBr introduce an ethoxy group via substitution.
10. While this sequence introduces all three substituents, the presence of the sulfonic acid group makes it inconsistent with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
None of the options perfectly align with the target structure. However, **Option D** comes closest to the desired sequence, as it introduces the nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy groups in a plausible order, despite introducing an extra sulfonic acid group. Based on the given options, **Option D** is the most reasonable choice.
