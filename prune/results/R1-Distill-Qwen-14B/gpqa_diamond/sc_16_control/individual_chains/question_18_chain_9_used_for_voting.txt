Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D. I remember that these abundance ratios are often given in terms of logarithms, so I need to be careful with how I calculate them.

First, let's list the data given:

For Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

The Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5) = 1e-5.

Wait, why do I need the Sun's composition? Oh right, because the abundance ratios are given relative to the Sun's. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nY/nH) in the star compared to the Sun.

But wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So that means in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than the Sun's by 10^0.3. Similarly, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Fe abundance is same as the Sun's. So maybe the H is the same as the Sun's? Or wait, H is hydrogen. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(solar Fe/H) = 0. So nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, let me think again. The notation [X/Y] means log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So for [Fe/H]_1 = 0, it's log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → nFe/nH in star is same as Sun. Similarly for [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so Mg/H is same as Sun.

Wait no, wait. Wait, [Fe/H] is the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then the star's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's Fe/H. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → so nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, we're asked about the silicon ratio. How do I get silicon from this?

Hmm. I think we'll need to relate Si to Fe and Mg somehow.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the abundance of Si in Star_1 relative to H.
2. Find the abundance of Si in Star_2 relative to H.
3. Take the ratio of Si_2 / Si_1.

But wait, the problem is the ratio of silicon atoms, so [Si/Star_2] / [Si/Star_1] = (nSi2 / nH2) / (nSi1 / nH1) ).

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is (nSi2 / nH2) divided by (nSi1 / nH1), which would be (nSi2 / nSi1) * (nH1 / nH2). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi2 / nH2) divided by (nSi1 / nH1), which is (nSi2/nH2) * (nH1/nSi1). Wait, no, that's (nSi2 * nH1) / (nH2 * nSi1) ). Hmm, but I'm not sure if the H's are the same in both stars.

Wait, but the problem says to "consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun". It doesn't say anything about the stars' H abundances. So perhaps we can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun? Or, alternatively, perhaps the H is the same everywhere?

Wait, but in stars, the H abundance can vary, but in this problem, perhaps considering that the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, which implies that the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun. Because for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → Fe is same as Sun. But wait, what about other elements? Do their H abundances change? Hmm, no, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio between Fe and H. So if that's 0, then Fe and H are at the same ratio as the Sun.

But wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) in the star minus (nFe/nH) in the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then (nFe/nH) = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) → so the ratio is the same. So for Star_1, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Now, let's focus on Star_1 first.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe] = 0.3. So:

[Si/Fe] = log10(nSi_1 /nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → from [Fe/H] =0.

So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) → since nH_1 = nH_sun (assuming same H as Sun?), wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps nH_1 is the same as nH_sun because [Fe/H] is 0. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → nFe/nH = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So if nH_1 is the same as nH_sun, then nFe_1 = nFe_sun, but that may not necessarily be the case because nH could change. Wait, but if [Fe/H] is 0, then:

nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

But perhaps, for simplicity, we can assume that the H abundance is the same as the Sun's in both stars? Because otherwise, we don't have data on it. The problem doesn't provide any information about the H abundance in the stars beyond what is implied by [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Maybe I should proceed step by step.

Let me denote Sun's abundances as follows.

Let’s compute for Star_1:

Given [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which is log10 (nSi1 / nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

We can write:

log10(nSi1 /nFe1) = 0.3 + log10(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Exponentiating both sides:

nSi1 /nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

We can compute 10^0.3 ≈ 2 (since 10^0.3 ≈ 2).

So nSi1 = nFe1 * (10^0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But from Star_1's [Fe/H] = 0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

Wait, so nFe1 is scaled by the ratio of H in Star_1 to H in Sun. But unless we know how much H is in Star_1, we can't proceed. Hmm. Maybe I can express everything in terms of nH_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express all abundances relative to hydrogen.

Let's define for each star, the abundance of an element X as nX / nH.

For Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 ⇒ (nFe1 / nH1) = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) → let's denote this as X_Fe = X_Fe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 ⇒ (nMg2 / nH2) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) → X_Mg = X_Mg_sun.

Now, let's find nSi1 and nSi2.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3. [X/Fe] is log10(nX/nFe) - log10(nX_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, nSi1 / nFe1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But since nFe1 = X_Fe * nH1, and X_Fe = X_Fe_sun = (nFe_sun /nH_sun).

So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, nSi1 = X_Si1 * nH1.

So, let's plug into the equation:

(X_Si1 * nH1) / ( (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1 ) ) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Simplify:

X_Si1 / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Multiply both sides by (nFe_sun /nH_sun):

X_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun )

The nFe_sun cancels:

X_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

But nSi_sun /nH_sun is X_Si_sun.

So X_Si1 = 10^0.3 * X_Si_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, we can find X_Si2.

Wait, what about Star_2? The given is [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

[Mg/Si] = log10( nMg2 /nSi2 ) - log10( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Which implies:

nMg2 /nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

But for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → X_Mg2 = X_Mg_sun = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So nMg2 = X_Mg_sun * nH2.

nSi2 = X_Si2 * nH2.

So the ratio becomes:

(X_Mg_sun * nH2) / (X_Si2 * nH2) ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Simplify:

X_Mg_sun / X_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

But nMg_sun /nSi_sun = X_Mg_sun / X_Si_sun.

So we have:

X_Mg_sun / X_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (X_Mg_sun / X_Si_sun )

Divide both sides by X_Mg_sun:

1 / X_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (1 / X_Si_sun )

→ X_Si2 = X_Si_sun / 10^0.3.

Hmm, so for Star_1, X_Si1 is 10^0.3 times the solar X_Si, and for Star_2, X_Si2 is 1/(10^0.3) times the solar X_Si.

Wait, so:

X_Si1 = X_Si_sun * 10^0.3

X_Si2 = X_Si_sun / 10^0.3

So the ratio of X_Si2 to X_Si1 would be:

(X_Si2) / (X_Si1) = (X_Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) / ( X_Si_sun * 10^0.3 )

Cancel X_Si_sun:

= (1 / 10^0.3 ) / (10^0.3 ) )

= 1 / (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 )

= 1 / 10^0.6 ≈ 1 / 3.98 → approximately 0.25.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So is it (nSi2 / nH2) divided by (nSi1 / nH1 ) → which is (X_Si2) / (X_Si1) → which I just found as ~0.25.

But looking at the options, option C is ~0.8 and option D is ~1.2. Hmm, 0.25 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ratio direction. Let me re-express.

The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's Star_1 / Star_2? Or Star_2 / Star_1?

Wait, the wording says "the ratio of silicon atoms" in Star_1 and Star_2. So which one is numerator and denominator?

Wait, the exact wording is "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think that's Star_1's silicon atoms to Star_2's. So the ratio is (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 / nH2) ) → which is (X_Si1 / X_Si2 )

Wait, earlier I calculated X_Si2 = X_Si_sun / 10^0.3, and X_Si1 = X_Si_sun * 10^0.3.

So X_Si1 / X_Si2 = (X_Si_sun * 10^0.3 ) / ( X_Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) ) → (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 → ~4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that's one of the choices.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was X_Si2 / X_Si1, but perhaps it's the other way around. Let me double-check.

The question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think that's Star_1's silicon divided by Star_2's silicon → nSi1 / nSi2.

But wait, in terms of their abundances relative to H, it's (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) → (X_Si1 * nH1 ) / (X_Si2 * nH2 )

Hmm, but from earlier, we can't assume nH1 and nH2 are the same as the Sun's or as each other, because the problem doesn't state that. So unless we can find a way to relate nH1 and nH2, this could complicate things.

Wait, but wait a second. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which implies that (nFe1 /nH1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → So nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, I can't directly relate the abundances of Si in each star.

Wait, but earlier I might have made a mistake in assuming that the ratio X_Si1 / X_Si2 is 10^0.6. Because X_Si is nSi/nH. But perhaps the actual ratio of Si atoms depends on the ratio of H in each star.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately.

Let me consider that the Sun's photosphere has X_H_sun = nH_sun (the number density of H in the Sun) and similarly for the stars.

But I don't have data on the stars' H abundances beyond what's given by [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → (nFe1 /nH1 ) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ), so nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * nH1.

Similarly, Star_2's nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

But to find nSi1 and nSi2, perhaps I can express them in terms of their own H.

But for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → (nSi1 /nFe1 ) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

So:

nSi1 = (nFe1 ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 → so substituting:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi1 = (nH1 ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 → nH1 is the number of H atoms in Star_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg2 /nSi2 ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

And since nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2, substituting:

(nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 / nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

→ nSi2 = (nH2 ) * (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) ) /10^0.3.

Wait, no. Let me re-arrange.

(nMg2 /nH2 ) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) → so nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (nMg2 /nSi2 ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Substitute nMg2:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 ) / nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Multiply both sides by nSi2:

(nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *nSi2.

Divide both sides by (nMg_sun /nH_sun ):

nH2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) ) *nSi2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve for nSi2.

From the equation:

nSi2 = (nMg2 * nSi_sun )/( (nMg_sun /10^0.3 ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach.

We can express nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of their H.

For Star_1: nSi1 = X_Si1 * nH1.

And for Star_2: nSi2 = X_Si2 * nH2.

We need to find the ratio (nSi1 ) / (nSi2 ) = (X_Si1 * nH1 ) / (X_Si2 * nH2 )

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, we can't compute this ratio directly. Unless we can find a relationship between nH1 and nH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because the problem doesn't provide any other information.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, which implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. If the H abundance is the same as the Sun, then nH1 = nH_sun. So nFe1 = nFe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2= nMg_sun.

If that's the case, then for Star_1, nH1 = nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, nH2 = nH_sun.

But wait, that would imply that both stars have the same H abundance as the Sun. But that might not be the case. Because stars can have different H abundances, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H abundance is the same as the Sun in both stars. Because otherwise, we don't have enough data to proceed.

So assuming that:

nH1 = nH_sun.

nH2 = nH_sun.

Then, we can proceed.

So for Star_1:

nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * nH1 = nFe_sun.

Similarly, nMg2 = nMg_sun.

Now, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun )

→ nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

But nFe1 =nFe_sun → nSi1 = nFe_sun * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) = 10^0.3 *nSi_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

→ nSi2 = nMg2 * (nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 *nMg_sun )

But nMg2 =nMg_sun → nSi2 = (nMg_sun * nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 *nMg_sun ) ) = nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

So now, the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 is:

nSi1 /nSi2 = (10^0.3 *nSi_sun ) / (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ) = 10^0.3 * 10^0.3 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 4, which is option A (~3.9).

Wait, but the options are A) ~3.9, which matches this.

But wait, let me double-check. Because the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi1/nSi2 is approximately 3.98, which is ~4. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances relative to hydrogen and iron.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: 1.5 solar masses.
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex.
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: 1.2 solar masses.
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex.
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log₁₀(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log₁₀(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
   - 12 + log₁₀(nMg/nH) = 7 → log₁₀(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10⁻⁵.

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- [Fe/H]₁ = 0 implies that the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
- [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 implies:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}}.
  \]

#### Star_2:
- [Mg/H]₂ = 0 implies that the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
- [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 implies:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{10^{0.3}}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{10^{0.3}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
