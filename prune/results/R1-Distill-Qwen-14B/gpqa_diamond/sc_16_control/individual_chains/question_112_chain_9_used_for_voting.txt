Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves finding probabilities and the average value of an operator given a specific state. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional—so I guess I should normalize it. Because probabilities require the state to have a norm of 1. So I'll need to find the normalization constant.

The spin states |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. So they form an orthonormal basis. That's good because the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero, and each has inner product 1 with themselves.

The state |alpha> is a linear combination of these. Let me write it as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). To normalize, I need to compute |a|^2 + |b|^2, then take the reciprocal of the square root as the normalization factor.

Calculating |a|^2: (1+i) times its complex conjugate (1-i) gives (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 - i +i - i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, |a|² is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2. Yep, same as before.

Then |b|²: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i². i² is -1, so 4 + 0 +1 =5.

So the total squared norm is |a|² + |b|² = 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0  ]

Wait, that's a spin operator in the x or y direction? Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices, for example, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, but our operator here has off-diagonal elements of hbar/2, so perhaps it's (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Because sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal, and zeros on diagonal.

Wait, if the operator is A = (hbar/2) sigma_x, then its matrix elements would be (hbar/2) times the sigma_x matrix. So yes, that's right. So the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are equal superpositions of |up> and |down>. But wait, in this problem, we're being asked about measuring the operator A. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of |alpha> in each of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2, since sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, let me think. The operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. So the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1). So the possible measurement outcomes are ± hbar/2.

But wait, the question is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the operator. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are |<alpha|+x>|² and |<alpha|-x>|².

So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix A can be diagonalized, but I think it's easier to find its eigenstates.

Wait, sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So I can express |alpha> in terms of these.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). Let me express this as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) |+x> + ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) |-x> ) ] / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ]

Simplify coefficients:

For |+x>:
1+i + 2 -i = 3

For |-x>:
(1 + i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i

So:

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ]

So the coefficient for |+x> is 3 / sqrt(14), and for |-x> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability of measuring +hbar/2 (which is the eigenvalue for |+x>) is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is | (-1 +2i) |² / 14.

Calculating | -1 +2i |²: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again. The coefficient is (-1 +2i) over sqrt(14). So the modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is approximately 0.357142. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Hmm, 0.64 is close to 9/14 (which is ~0.642857), and 0.36 is close to 5/14 (which is ~0.3571). So maybe option A is the probability part.

Wait, but let's read the question again. Oh wait, the first part is to find the probabilities, and the second part is the average value.

Wait, but the question says, calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and their probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake in the signs? Because when I substituted |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, |alpha> = [3|+x> + (-1 +2i)|-x> ] / sqrt(14). So the coefficients are correct. So the modulus squared for each is correct, 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A's first two numbers.

Wait, but let me check the average value. The average value of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the average value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in |alpha>.

But expectation value of sigma_x is <sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Let me compute this.

Alternatively, since sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> using the coefficients of |alpha> in the |up> and |down> basis.

The expectation value <sigma_x> = <up| sigma_x |up> coefficient + <down| sigma_x |down> coefficient, but wait, more accurately, it's the sum over the components.

Wait, let me express |alpha> as a column vector. Let me write |up> as (1,0), |down> as (0,1). So |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^* (0) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^* (1) ) ] + [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) (1) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) (0) ) ].

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> as follows:

The expectation value is (1/sqrt(7))^2 * [ (1+i)*0 + (1+i) conjugate times 1 ] + [ (2-i)*0 + (2-i) conjugate times 1 ]

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps expand the calculation as:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (a* + b) ]

Where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b* is (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

Wait, no, sigma_x swaps the basis states. So when you apply sigma_x to |alpha>, you get a |down> component and b |up> component.

Wait, let me compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down> = [a, b]^T.

sigma_x |alpha> = [0 1; 1 0] [a; b] = [b; a].

Then <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [a* b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

Which is (a* b + b* a) = 2 Re(a* b).

So compute a* b: a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i².

i squared is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Then Re(a* b) is the real part, which is 1/7.

So 2 Re(a* b) is 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Then, the average value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Wait, that's what I get. So the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.357 or 0.36), and the average is hbar/7.

So the option that matches these is option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

But let me check the options again.

Option A) "0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7" — that's what I have.

Wait, but let me confirm the average calculation again.

Alternative approach: because the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is a state in the z-basis. The expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in |alpha>.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * [ ( (1+i)(2 -i) + (1 -i)(2 +i) ) / (7) ) ].

Wait, why? Because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which can be represented as a 2x2 matrix with off-diagonal elements 1. The expectation value would be <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> which is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So that's ( (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 -i) ) /7.

Compute numerator:

(1+i)(2 -i) = 2 -i + 2i -i^2 = 2 +i +1 (because -i^2 =1) → 3 +i.

(2 +i)(1 -i) = 2(1) + 2(-i) + i(1) +i (-i) = 2 -2i +i -i² → 2 -i +1 →3 -i.

Adding them together: (3 +i) + (3 -i) =6.

So numerator is 6, denominator 7. So expectation value is 6/7.

Wait, wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, where am I making a mistake here?

Wait, no, because the calculation I just did is (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 -i) = (3+i) + (3 -i) =6.

Wait, but wait, why is this the case? Because sigma_x's expectation value is <up| a a^* down> + <down| b b^* up>, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The state |alpha> is a|up> +b|down>. The expectation value of sigma_x is (a^* b + b^* a).

Because sigma_x = |up><down| + |down><up|.

So, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a^* b + b^* a.

Which is 2 Re(a^* b).

So, a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

a^* b = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Multiply numerator: 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

So 2 Re(a^* b) = 2 * (1/7) )= 2/7.

Wait, but in the other approach I got 6/7. So where is the mistake?

Ah! I think I messed up the calculation earlier when I expanded (1+i)(2 -i) and (2 +i)(1 -i). Let's recompute those.

Compute (1+i)(2 -i):

1*2 =2.

1*(-i)= -i.

i*2=2i.

i*(-i)= -i² = +1.

So 2 -i +2i +1 → (2+1) + ( -i +2i ) →3 +i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 -i):

2*1=2.

2*(-i)= -2i.

i*1= i.

i*(-i)= -i² = +1.

So 2 -2i +i +1 →(2+1) + (-2i +i ) →3 -i.

Adding 3+i +3 -i =6 → correct.

So the sum is 6, so 6/7.

Wait, but according to the other method, a^* b is (1 -3i)/7, then 2 Re(a^* b) is 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

But this contradicts the other approach, which gives 6/7. So what's going on?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me check.

Wait, when I compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = a^* b + b^* a.

a^* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a^* b = [ (1 - i)(2 - i) ] /7.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

Similarly, b^* a is ( (2 +i)(1 +i) ) /7.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i →2 +2i +i +i² →2 +3i -1 →1 +3i.

So a^* b is (1 -3i)/7, and b^* a is (1 +3i)/7.

Adding them together: (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

So the expectation value of sigma_x is 2/7.

But earlier, when I computed the same using the matrix approach, I got 6/7. Which one is correct?

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the matrix approach. Let me double-check.

In the matrix approach, |alpha> = [ a; b ] where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So sigma_x |alpha> = [0 1; 1 0] [a; b] = [b; a].

So <alpha | sigma_x | alpha> = [ a^* b^* ] [b; a] = a^* b + b^* a.

Which is exactly what I did in the other approach, giving 2/7. So why when I computed using the expanded form I got 6/7?

Ah, because I think I made a mistake in the expansion. Wait, let me recompute <sigma_x> as (a^* b + b^* a ) again.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a^* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Compute (1 -i)(2 -i) =1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) =2 -i -2i +i^2 → 2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

Similarly, b^* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Compute (2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i →2 +2i +i +(-1) → (2 -1) +3i →1 +3i.

So a^* b = (1 -3i)/7, b^* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding them: (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 =2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7, so the average value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7 )= hbar/7.

Which matches option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.357). The average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says probabilities of 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A is correct.

But let me check the other options to make sure.

Option D: probabilities 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, 0.61 is about 8.5/14, which is not matching. So no.

Option C: probabilities 0.28 and 0.72. 0.28 is 4/14, which doesn't match 5/14 and 9/14.

Option B: 0.54 and 0.46. Hmm, that's about 7.54/14 and 6.44/14, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients \( a = (1+i) \) and \( b = (2-i) \). 

- \( |a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 2 \)
- \( |b|^2 = (2-i)(2+i) = 5 \)

The total squared norm is \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). These eigenstates are used to express \( |\alpha\rangle \).

Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}|+x\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}|-x\rangle.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

- Probability of \( |+x\rangle \): \( \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \),
- Probability of \( |-x\rangle \): \( \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \).

To calculate the average value of \( A \), we compute the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \). Using the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- Probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \),
- Average value: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

These match **Option A**.

Answer: A
