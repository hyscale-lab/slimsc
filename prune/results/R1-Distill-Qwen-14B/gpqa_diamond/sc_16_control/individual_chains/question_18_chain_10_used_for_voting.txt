Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the masses directly affect the abundances here. The problem is about their elemental ratios.

The given data includes [Si/Fe] for Star_1 as 0.3 dex. And [Mg/Si] for Star_2 as 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, and [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0. Oh wait, and we have the solar photosphere composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, which I think translates to log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5, so same as Fe? Wait no, the Sun's data says 12 + log10(nMg/nH) is 7. So log10(nMg/nH) is -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5. Wait wait, let me get that right.

Wait, the question says the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, subtracting 12 from both sides: log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5. So nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, but what about the other elements? We need to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So let me list what's given.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
[Fe/H]_1 = 0.

For Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
[Mg/H]_2 =0.

We need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1's and Star_2's photospheres.

Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's recall that [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun.

So [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) )

Which is log10( (n_X * n_Y_sun) / (n_Y * n_X_sun) )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

Which means (log10(n_Si/n_Fe,1) ) - (log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun) )=0.3.

Wait, no. Wait, the definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [X/Y] = log( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) )

Which equals log( (n_X * n_Y_sun) / (n_Y * n_X_sun) )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3.

So 0.3 = log10( ( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) ) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) )

Which is log( (n_Si_1 n_Fe_sun) / (n_Fe_1 n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe_1/n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )= 0.

So log(n_Fe_1/n_H_1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun).

Which means n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But since n_H_1 is the hydrogen density in Star_1, which is the same as in the Sun, scaled by [Fe/H], which is 0. So n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) )

But wait, if [Fe/H] is 0, that means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So the ratio n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun).

Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So n_Mg_2/n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

So n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun).

But wait, the ratio of hydrogen in the two stars... Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating that part. Let's see.

Because [Fe/H] is 0, the number of Fe in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun relative to H. Similarly for Mg in Star_2.

So, for Star_1:

n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun )

But n_H_1 is H in Star_1. But since the stars are in LTE and we’re using the EW method, which measures abundance ratios relative to H, perhaps we can treat H as a fixed scale. Wait, but maybe the actual number of H isn't necessary because we can express the ratios in terms of the solar values.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the stars is the same as in the Sun because the [Fe/H] is 0. Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe to H compared to solar. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then the ratio n_Fe/n_H in the star is the same as in the Sun. Therefore, n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun, so n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But I think for the purpose of finding the ratio of Si in the two stars, maybe the actual number of H cancels out. Let me try to proceed.

So, for Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

Which is log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So,

(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

We can write this as:

n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But since n_H_1 is in Star_1, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of n_H_sun. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the abundances in terms of the solar values. Let me define the solar abundances as:

n_X_sun = X_sun * n_H_sun,

where X_sun is the number fraction. But perhaps more accurately, n_X / n_H is a certain value.

Wait, for the Sun, we know n_Fe/n_H = 1e-4.5, because log10(n_Fe/n_H) is -4.5. Similarly, n_Mg/n_H is 1e-5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But again, maybe it's easier to express all variables relative to the Sun's H.

So let me think about Star_1:

n_Si_1 = n_Si_sun * 10^{[Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/Si]_sun} ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which is log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) )=0.3.

So,

n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But I also can relate n_Si_1 in terms of n_Fe_1.

Wait, perhaps I can express n_Si_1 in terms of n_Fe_sun and n_H_1.

Let me write:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * n_Fe_1 * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Substituting:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

But n_Si_sun / n_H_sun is the solar ratio for Si, which is n_Si_sun = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.

Wait, the Sun's n_Si / n_H is known. From the given data, for the Sun, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Similarly, for Si, is it given? Wait, the question gives [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], but for the Sun, we have nFe/nH and nMg/nH, but not nSi/nH.

Hmm, so maybe I can express [Mg/Si] in the Sun to find the ratio.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) → no, that would be zero. Wait, no, [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. For the Sun, [X/Y] would be zero.

But in the problem, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So for Star_2, the Mg/Si ratio is higher than solar by 0.3 dex.

But since the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero, that means n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun = 10^0 =1. So [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun =1 → n_Mg =n_Si in the Sun.

So n_Mg_sun = n_Si_sun.

Wait, that's helpful. Because from the Sun's data, n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5, and n_Si_sun/n_H_sun = ?

Wait, n_Si_sun is not given, but perhaps from [Mg/Si] in the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is 0, so log(n_Mg/n_Si) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.

So log(n_Mg/n_Si) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Which implies n_Mg/n_Si = n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun.

But since [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, n_Mg_sun = n_Si_sun.

So in the Sun, n_Mg = n_Si.

So n_Si_sun = n_Mg_sun =1e-5 (since n_Mg/nH is 1e-5).

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. n_Mg_sun is 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Si_sun is something else. Because [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun =1 → n_Si_sun = n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun.

Wait, that's correct. Because n_Mg_sun = n_Si_sun → n_Si_sun = n_Mg_sun = (1e-5) * n_H_sun.

So, n_Si_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

Similarly, n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

But let me think about n_Fe_sun and n_Si_sun:

n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

n_Si_sun =1e-5 * n_H_sun.

So the ratio n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) )= 1e-0.5 = 1/√10 ≈ 0.316.

So [Si/Fe]_sun = log10(0.316) ≈ -0.5 dex.

But wait, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, which is higher than solar, meaning more Si relative to Fe.

Wait, but Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. So if [Si/Fe] is higher, then Si must be higher than Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

Which is log( (n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) )=0.3.

So,

(n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

As we have n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun = 1e-5 / (1e-4.5) )= 1e-0.5 ≈0.316.

So,

n_Si_1/n_Fe_1 = 0.316 * 10^0.3.

Calculate 10^0.3: approximately 2. So 0.316 *2 ≈0.632.

So,

n_Si_1 = 0.632 * n_Fe_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1/n_H_sun) ).

Wait, since [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Similarly, n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it. Alternatively, perhaps express all in terms of n_H.

Wait, n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Similarly, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

So,

n_Si_1 = (1e-5) * n_H_1.

n_Fe_1 = (1e-4.5) * n_H_1.

So,

n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1 = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.316.

But this is the solar ratio. But Star_1 has [Si/Fe] of 0.3, which is higher. So,

0.3 = log10( (n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) )

= log10( (n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) / 0.316 )

So,

(n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) = 0.316 * 10^0.3 ≈ 0.316 * 2 ≈ 0.632.

But from the above, n_Si_1 =0.632 * n_Fe_1.

Wait, but from the expressions in terms of n_H_1:

n_Si_1 = (1e-5) *n_H_1.

n_Fe_1 = (1e-4.5)*n_H_1.

So,

n_Si_1 = (1e-5 /1e-4.5) *n_Fe_1 = (1e-0.5) *n_Fe_1 ≈ 0.316 *n_Fe_1.

But according to the [Si/Fe]_1, n_Si_1 = 0.632 *n_Fe_1.

Which implies that 0.316 *n_Fe_1 =0.632 *n_Fe_1 → which can't be right unless I made a mistake.

Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere. Let me try another approach.

Let me think in terms of the EW method. The EW method gives the abundance ratios directly. So perhaps I can work out the ratios step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0. So n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H_1.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So,

log10( (n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) )=0.3.

Which can be rearranged as:

n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Substituting n_Fe_1 from above,

n_Si_1 = [ (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H_1 ] * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H_1 *10^0.3.

So,

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun * 10^0.3 ) /n_H_sun *n_H_1.

But n_Si_sun = 1e-5 *n_H_sun (since n_Mg_sun =n_Si_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun).

So substituting:

n_Si_1 = (1e-5 *n_H_sun * 10^0.3 ) /n_H_sun *n_H_1.

The n_H_sun cancels:

n_Si_1 = 1e-5 *10^0.3 *n_H_1.

Which is approximately 1e-5 *2 *n_H_1 = 2e-5 *n_H_1.

Now, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

So log10( (n_Mg_2/n_Si_2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

Which can be rearranged as:

n_Mg_2 = n_Si_2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^0.3.

But in the Sun, n_Mg_sun =n_Si_sun, so (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun)=1.

So,

n_Mg_2 = n_Si_2 *1 *10^0.3 → n_Si_2 = n_Mg_2 /10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2/n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H_2.

Since n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun,

n_Mg_2 = (1e-5 *n_H_sun /n_H_sun) ) *n_H_2 =1e-5 *n_H_2.

So,

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 *n_H_2 ) / 10^0.3.

Which is approximately (1e-5 *n_H_2 ) / 2 → 5e-6 *n_H_2.

Now, we need the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2:

(n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2) = [2e-5 *n_H_1 ] / [5e-6 *n_H_2 ].

Simplify:

= (2e-5 /5e-6) ) * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

= (0.4) * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

But wait, do we know anything about n_H_1 and n_H_2? Are they the same?

No, because the stars have different masses, but I don't think that directly affects the ratio here. Wait, but in the photosphere, the number of hydrogen atoms might depend on the star's overall composition, but since both stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero relative to H, maybe the H abundance is the same as the Sun? Or perhaps the H is the same for both stars, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ratio of H in the two stars is 1, meaning n_H_1 =n_H_2. Because both have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero, so their H abundance is the same as the Sun. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in Star_1 and Star_2 is the same as in the Sun, but that's probably not correct because the stars can have different H abundances, but given their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], perhaps their H is the same as the Sun.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1=0 means that [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun. So, Fe is same as Sun relative to H. That doesn’t mean that H is the same as the Sun. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). So if [Fe/H] is zero, then n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

So n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H_1.

But unless we have information about the overall H abundance relative to the Sun, perhaps we can't determine n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Hmm, but this complicates things. Because without knowing n_H_1 and n_H_2, we can't find the ratio (n_Si_1/n_Si_2) unless they cancel out.

Wait, let me think again.

n_Si_1 = 2e-5 *n_H_1.

n_Si_2 =5e-6 *n_H_2.

So, the ratio is (2e-5 n_H_1)/(5e-6 n_H_2) )= (2e-5/5e-6) ) * (n_H_1/n_H_2) )= (4) * (n_H_1/n_H_2).

But unless n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same, I can't find the ratio. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars, or perhaps I'm missing a relation.

Wait wait, wait. Maybe the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero implies that the H abundance is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )=0.

So,

n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly for Star_2,

n_Mg_2/n_H_2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But this doesn't necessarily mean that n_H_1 =n_H_sun, because n_Fe_1 could be different if n_H changes. But wait, for [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe_1 is set relative to n_H_1, which could have any value.

Wait, perhaps the H abundances are the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because if [Fe/H] is zero, their Fe is at the same level relative to H as the Sun. But it doesn't specify the H abundance.

Hmmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So n_H_1 =n_H_sun, and n_H_2 =n_H_sun.

If that's the case, then:

n_Si_1 =2e-5 *n_H_sun.

n_Si_2=5e-6 *n_H_sun.

So their ratio is (2e-5)/(5e-6) ) → 2e-5 /5e-6 = (2/5)*10 = 4.

So the ratio is approximately 4.

Wait, but the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

So option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, n_Si_1 =2e-5 *n_H_sun.

n_Si_2 =5e-6 *n_H_sun.

So ratio n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = (2e-5) / (5e-6) )= (2/5)*10^1 = 4.

Yes, 4.

So the answer would be approximately 4, which is option A.

But wait, wait. Let me step back and make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, in the calculation for Star_2, I had:

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 *n_H_2 ) / 10^0.3.

But 10^0.3 is approximately 2. So 1e-5 /2 is 5e-6.

Thus, n_Si_2 =5e-6 *n_H_2.

Similarly, n_Si_1 =2e-5 *n_H_1.

So if n_H_1 =n_H_2 (which I assumed earlier), then the ratio is (2e-5)/(5e-6) )=4.

But why would I assume n_H_1 =n_H_2?

Because both stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero, which makes their Fe and Mg abundances same as the Sun relative to H. But that doesn't necessarily mean that H is the same in both stars. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) relative to solar, not the H abundance relative to solar.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2/n_H_2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But this doesn't fix n_H_1 or n_H_2 relative to the Sun. So without knowing their actual hydrogen abundance, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that H is the same in both stars as in the Sun.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is equal to the ratio of their masses, but I don't think that's correct either.

Wait, but another approach: The ratio [Fe/H] is zero, so the number of H in each star is the same as in the Sun. So n_H_1 =n_H_sun, n_H_2 =n_H_sun.

If that's the case, then the ratio is 4, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the number of H atoms, but the number of H nuclei relative to themselves. Wait, that's probably not necessary. I think I should proceed with the assumption that n_H_1 and n_H_2 are same as the Sun, which gives the ratio as 4.

So the correct answer is A) ~3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photosphere composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
1. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex**:  
   This implies that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun. Using the definition of the abundance ratio:  
   \[
   [\text{Si/Fe}] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}\right) - \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}\right),
   \]  
   we find:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
   \]  
   From the solar data, \( n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} = 10^{-5} \) and \( n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}} = \frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-4.5}} = 10^{-0.5} \approx 0.316.
   \]  
   Substituting:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} = 0.316 \cdot 10^{0.3} \approx 0.316 \cdot 2 = 0.632.
   \]

2. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex**:  
   This means the iron abundance in Star_1 relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} = 10^{-4.5}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \).

3. **Silicon abundance in Star_1**:  
   Using \( n_{\text{Si}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_1 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \cdot 0.632.
   \]  
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = (10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}) \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \cdot 0.632 = 10^{-4.5} \cdot 0.632 \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = 2 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1.
   \]

### Star_2:
1. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex**:  
   This implies that the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun. Using the definition of the abundance ratio:  
   \[
   [\text{Mg/Si}] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}\right) - \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}\right),
   \]  
   we find:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
   \]  
   From the solar data, \( n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} = 10^{-5} \) and \( n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot} / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} = 10^{-5} \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}} = 1.
   \]  
   Substituting:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 1 \cdot 10^{0.3} \approx 2.
   \]  
   Thus, \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{2} \).

2. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex**:  
   This means the magnesium abundance in Star_2 relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} = 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( n_{\text{Mg}}_2 = n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \).

3. **Silicon abundance in Star_2**:  
   Using \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{2} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}}{2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}}{2} = 5 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2.
   \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{2 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1}{5 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2}.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{2 \cdot 10^{-5}}{5 \cdot 10^{-6}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = 4 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2}.
\]  

Assuming the hydrogen abundance in both stars is the same as in the Sun (\( n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_2 = n_{\text{H}}^{\odot} \)), the ratio simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 4.
\]  

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**, which corresponds to option **A**.
