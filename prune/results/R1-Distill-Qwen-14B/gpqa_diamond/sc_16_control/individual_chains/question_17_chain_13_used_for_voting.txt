Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So when it forms a complex with a metal ion like Ca²+, it binds them tightly. The K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. Or wait, the complex might actually be CaY²- if the charge is considered. But the exact formula might not matter right now.

The problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that means the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. But in solution, some of this complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But with such a large K value, I bet the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of free Ca²+ would be really low.

The formation constant K is given as 5x10^10. I remember that K for a complex is given by K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if the complex is in solution, assuming that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, then I can set up an equation.

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. If the complex dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x (assuming 1:1 ratio), and [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, maybe x is very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the K equation: K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, let me write that equation: 5e10 = (0.02) / (x²). Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10. Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12. So x² = 4e-13? Wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13. Taking square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So 2e-6. So x is 2e-6 M.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 4e-13's square root is sqrt(4)*1e-6.5? Hmm, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Because 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 1e-14. So 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? No, because 1e-6.5 squared is 1e-13, right. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7. Oh wait, that's option C: 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Yeah, that's about 6.3e-7, which is option C.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( x \). Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) remains approximately 0.02 M. The concentrations of \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ]\) and \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]\) are both \( x \), as they are in a 1:1 ratio. Substituting into the equation:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
