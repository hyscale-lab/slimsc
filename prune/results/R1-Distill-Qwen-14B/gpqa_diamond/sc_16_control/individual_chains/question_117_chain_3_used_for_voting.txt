Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They have chiral centers, I think. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So the question is asking which of the given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh, biphenyl rings connected at position 1-1'. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So are there any chiral centers here? Wait, the ring itself. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might not. But if the substituents create a chiral center, then yes.

Wait, the biphenyl part—so each ring is attached at position 1. If the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, but wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So on each ring, there are two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate, but at opposite positions (like para positions). Wait, in the biphenyl, positions 2 and 6 are meta to the connecting point? Or wait, biphenyl is connected at position 1, so positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the connecting point on each ring. Wait, perhaps each ring has two substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has two substituents, which are both at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but if each ring has two substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting point, does that create a chiral center? Or perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

Wait, perhaps each ring is symmetric. Let me think: if each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, and the two rings are connected. Wait, but the positions are 2 and 2'—so on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that each ring individually is symmetric, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically around the connecting point. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, wait, no. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or perhaps I have the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, maybe it's:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But with a hydroxyl at position 2. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be a secondary alcohol. But wait, is there a chiral center here?

In this case, the middle carbon (the one with OH) is connected to: CH2(OH) would be connected to two CH2 groups. Let me see: the carbon chain is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is:

The propanoate is:

CH2-CH2-COO-

But with OH on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate would have three carbons. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that can't be right because that's only two carbons in the chain. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group? No, wait: the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3 is the carboxylate group attached to the second carbon. So wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Or is it CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the three carbons are: COOCH3 attached to the third carbon, the second is OH, and the first is CH2. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then, looking at the second carbon: what groups are attached?

The central carbon (second carbon) would have:

- a hydrogen (because it's CH2(OH)CH2...),
Wait no, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2-?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The propanoate is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not possible because that's only three carbons, so it's:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Carbon chain: COOCH3 is on carbon 3, hydroxyl on carbon 2.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Then, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let's see the structure: the second carbon (the one with OH) is bonded to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2 (which is connected to COOCH3)
Wait, no, perhaps the second carbon is connected to:

- One CH2 group (from the first carbon)
- One OH group
- One CH2 group (from the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the second carbon is CH2, so each of those would have two CH2 groups attached. But that can't be right because that would make four substituents on the second carbon: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait, each CH2 group is a carbon attached to two hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- One OH
- One CH2OH group
- One CH2COOCH3 group
- And one hydrogen.

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the possibility of a chiral center. For a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents.

If the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2COOCH3, no, that can't be right because that would be four carbons. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have three carbons. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the middle one) has:

- OH
- CH2 (connected to COOCH3)
- CH2 (connected to the first carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Let me think, the second carbon is the middle one. So:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, that would mean the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (carbon 1 and 3)
- One OH group.
- One hydrogen.

Wait, but that's four substituents: CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), and two hydrogens? No, that can't be. Wait, in that case, it's not a chiral center because two substituents are the same (two CH2 groups). So carbon 2 has two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. So substituents are: CH2-OH, CH2-COOCH3, H, and another H? No, so the substituents are CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), and two CH2 groups? I'm getting confused. Maybe the molecule is symmetric, so the second carbon doesn't have a chiral center. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the middle carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make the middle carbon a chiral center because it has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Oh wait, then that would mean it's a chiral center, so the molecule would have optical isomerism. So option 2 is a possibility.

But wait, what's the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. When it's esterified with methanol, the -OH is replaced by OCH3. So, methyl propanoate would be CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but then the second carbon has two CH2 groups (from both sides) and an OH. So substituents would be: two CH2 groups (from each adjacent carbon), an OH, and a hydrogen. So, are any of these substituents the same? The two CH2 groups are attached to different environments. Wait, but the substituents on the central carbon are:

- CH2-OH (left side)
- CH2-COOCH3 (right side)
- Two H's?

No, wait, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- One CH2 group (from first carbon)
- One CH2 group (from third carbon)
- One OH
- One H.

Wait, that's four substituents. But the two CH2 groups are both -CH2- groups. So, substituents would be:

- -CH2-OH
- -CH2-COOCH3
- -H
- another -H? Or is it maybe:

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is bonded to:

- One CH2(OH) group (on the left)
- One CH2(COOCH3) group (on the right)
- Two H's.

So substituents are: CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), H, H. So two H's make it not a chiral center. Because two substituents are the same (H). So that carbon isn't a chiral center. Hmm, so then where is the chiral center?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the middle carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from right)
- H.

So, four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. That makes it a chiral center. So in this case, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 would have optical isomerism.

But wait, is that correct? Because I'm getting conflicting possibilities based on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, so it doesn't have a chiral center. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So the carbonyl group is in the center, with two phenyl groups and an oxygen (double bond). So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. So, it's symmetric, no chiral centers. So benzophenone cannot have optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans version. So, the structure is CH2CH2, with two ester groups (OCH3) on opposite ends.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is O=C(CH2CH2COOCH3)2, but wait, no. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is O=C-OCH3 on both ends, connected by a CH=CH group. So the structure is: O=C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - O=C-OCH3? No, no, wait, fumarate is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the dimethyl ester would have two OCH3 groups on opposite ends. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - O=C-OCH3? No, wait, fumarate's structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on either end and a double bond in the middle. So the dimethyl ester is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3).

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. This creates a possibility of geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center.

Wait, but in this structure, are there any chiral centers? Let's see. Each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) are connected to two ester groups and two CH groups.

Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to CH2 groups? No, wait, no, it's O=C-OCH3 connected to CH groups which are double-bonded.

Wait, sorry, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a CH=CH group. So each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to an OCH3 group, a CH group, and perhaps another group. Wait, no. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C= C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in reality, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is trans.

But do any of the carbons have four different substituents? Let's look at the carbons in the double bond. Each of these carbons is double-bonded to another carbon, so they can't be chiral centers. Because each is bonded to (a) an OCH3 group, (b) a carbonyl group, (c) a CH group (maybe), but wait, no.

Wait, each of these carbons in the double bond is attached to:

- One OCH3 group (from the ester)
- One carbonyl group (C=O)
- Two CH groups.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons. So for each of the middle carbons, substituents are: OCH3, COOCH3, and two CH groups. Wait, but wait, each is double-bonded to the other, so they're each connected to an OCH3, a carbonyl (C=O), and two hydrogen? Or perhaps each is bonded to two other carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to:

- One OCH3 group (on the carbonyl)
- One CH2 group (but no, that's not right, because it's a double bond).

Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the central carbons is bonded to:

- One O from the carbonyl group (as in, the double bond)
- One OCH3 group (from the ester)
- Two CH groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: the molecule is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a double bond. So each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to:

- O from the carbonyl group (as part of the double bond)
- An OCH3 group (from the ester)
- Two other carbons (from the double bond).

Wait, but that makes each of these carbons have three substituents. Hmm, but that can't be. Alternatively, the structure is more like:

O=C-OCH3 is attached to each end of a CH2-CH2 group? No, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester would have OCH3 instead of OH on each end. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a CH=CH group. So each of the CH=CH carbons is bonded to:

- One OCH3 (from the ester)
- One C=O (from the carbonyl)
- Two CH2 groups? No, because it's a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons is bonded to:

- OCH3 (from the ester)
- Two CH groups (but that doesn't make sense because it's a double bond).

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-OCH3 – CH2 – CH2 – O=C-OCH3, but that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester, not fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond in the middle, so it's O=C-OCH3 – CH=CH – O=C-OCH3. So each of the central carbons is bonded to:

- One OCH3 group (from the ester)
- One carbonyl group (from the adjacent O=C-OCH3)
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, no, it's a double bond. So each of the central carbons is bonded to:

- One OCH3 (from the ester group)
- One carbonyl group (from the adjacent ester)
- One CH group (from the double bond)
- Another CH group (from the other side of the double bond).

Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons (the ones in the double bond). So each of the central carbons is bonded to:

- One OCH3 (from the ester)
- One carbonyl group (from the adjacent ester)
- Two CH groups (from each end of the double bond).

Wait, but that makes each of these central carbons have four substituents: OCH3, carbonyl, and two CH groups. Are any of these substituents the same? For example, each CH group is attached to another CH group (since it's a double bond). So the substituents would be OCH3, carbonyl, and two CH groups. But the two CH groups are the same, so the substituents are OCH3, carbonyl, and two identical CH groups. So the central carbons are each attached to three different groups plus a double bond, but since they're double-bonded, they can't be chiral centers. Chiral centers require single bonds because they have four substituents, each a different group.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the central carbons are each part of a double bond, so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let me think. The ester groups are on each end. The molecule is symmetrical, so perhaps any potential chiral centers are mirrored. Wait, but wait, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So if there are chiral centers, they would be in pairs, making it a meso compound, which doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but in the dimethyl fumarate structure, are there any chiral centers? Let's see:

The molecule is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a CH=CH group. So each of the carbons in the CH=CH is attached to:

- OCH3 (from the ester)
- O=C-O (from the ester)
- CH groups on either side.

Wait, but each of these carbons is bonded to two CH groups, which are the same. So they don't have four different substituents. No chiral centers here.

Wait, but wait, what about the ester groups themselves? Each ester group is OCH3 attached to a carbonyl. The carbonyl is part of a planar structure, so those carbons are double-bonded and not chiral centers.

So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not so sure. I thought that fumarate has a trans configuration, but I'm not certain about the presence of chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other possibilities. Maybe the question is about geometric isomerism, but the question specifically asks about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers.

So, putting it all together:

Option 1: I'm not sure. Possible that it has a chiral center if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. Or perhaps it's a meso compound.

Option 2: It may or may not have a chiral center based on the structure.

Option 3: No optical isomerism.

Option 4: No optical isomerism, because no chiral centers.

Wait, but let me think again about option 4. Dimethyl fumarate: if it's the trans isomer, it's symmetric. So it doesn't have any chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

So which options have optical isomerism?

So, option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Let's think about the structure. Biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2.

Wait, if each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other on the ring. So for each ring, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate at meta positions. If the two rings are connected at position 1, then each substituent is in the same relative position on each ring.

But would this arrangement create a chiral center in the molecule? Or perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me imagine the biphenyl molecule. The two rings are connected at position 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are opposite each other relative to the connecting point.

Wait, 2 is one position away from the connecting point (position 1), and 6 is the position three away (since benzene is a six-membered ring). So position 2 is adjacent, and position 6 is across from that. So the substituents are on opposite sides of each ring.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would not have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a chiral center in the biphenyl structure.

Wait, biphenyl itself is a planar structure. Substituents on the rings can create a chiral center if the arrangement around the connecting point is asymmetric.

Wait, but the molecule is biphenyl, which is a single bond connecting two benzene rings. The rotation around the single bond can lead to different conformations, but in terms of isomerism, it's about the substituents.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the two rings. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. For each ring, the substituents are meta to each other. But looking at the two rings, their substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetric.

Wait, if the two rings are mirror images of each other across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. So in that case, it would not have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical, then it would have a chiral center.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think I'm stuck on this one. Let me try to think of another approach. The question says, which of these show optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If that molecule has a chiral center, then it would have optical isomerism. In my earlier analysis, I thought maybe it does, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. I think it doesn't have a chiral center.

So, looking at the options, which options have optical isomerism.

From the options given:

1: Maybe yes, maybe no.

2: Maybe yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So the candidates are 1 and 2, or only 2.

Wait, looking back at the options given in the question:

Options are:
A) 1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1,2

So if 1 and 2 are correct, then option D is correct.

But earlier analysis for option 1 is not clear.

Another approach: think about each option.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the structure is two benzene rings connected at position 1-1'. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Wait, 6 is the position opposite to 1 on each ring. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are these substituents in positions that create a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if I imagine one ring with substituents at 2 and 6, and the other ring also with substituents at 2' and 6', would the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's say the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that bisects the two benzene rings. So each substituent has a mirror image on the opposite ring. If yes, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral. If not, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but if both rings have the same substituents, the molecule could be symmetrical. For example, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, from the central bond, each ring has the same substituents arranged in the same way. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So option 1 would not exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, what if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides of the central bond? Oh, but the question is about constitutional isomerism or stereoisomerism. So, in the case of biphenyl, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that each has an opposite counterpart, then it's symmetrical.

Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Because substituents on each ring are in analogous positions, making the whole molecule symmetric. So no optical isomerism.

So, if option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, then only option 2 does. But looking back, option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, if the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon would have four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that's a chiral center. So option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting all together:

Which options have optical isomerism?

1. No.
2. Yes.
3. No.
4. No.

So the only one is option 2. But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So if option 1 doesn't have, then the correct options would be only 2, which is not given.

Wait, but the options given don't have an option with only 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2,4

B) 3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Hmm, so the options are A, B, C, D as above.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1.

Alternative approach: consider the possibility of axial chirality in biphenyl systems. For biphenyls to exhibit axial chirality, the substituents on the two rings must be arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. This is known as the biphenyl effect.

In the case of the given compound, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Let me think about this. Suppose each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So, for each ring, the substituent at 2 is on one side, and 6 is on the opposite side.

But how are the substituents arranged on each ring relative to each other? Since the two rings are connected at position 1, substituents at 2 and 6 are on opposite sides of each ring.

Wait, if the two substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry, then no axial chirality. But if they are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then axial chirality exists.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they mirror each other, the molecule would be symmetrical.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the specific example. Take the 2,6-dinitrophenyl group. If two benzene rings are connected, each with nitro at 6 and another substituent at 2, how does that affect symmetry?

Wait, perhaps each substituent is located in such a way that the arrangement on each ring is a mirror image of the other. Thus, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule could be chiral. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another thought: the molecule has two identical substituents on each ring. So if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule is achiral. If not, it's chiral.

Given that the substituents are the same on each ring (nitro and carboxylate), but their arrangement could be either symmetric or asymmetric.

Wait, but in the given compound, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other, the molecule is symmetric.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering that the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other, and given the way they're connected, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. So option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1 and 2

So if only 2 is correct, but the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Structure is O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-O-CO-OCH3 (trans configuration). So each of the ester groups is on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the central two carbons are in a double bond, so they're each bonded to two other carbons (the ones in the double bond), so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, no chiral centers in option 4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me reevaluate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the middle carbon has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. No, that can't be. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be CH(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached (from each side), an OH, and a hydrogen. So substituents are CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), and two H's. So two H's make the substituents not all different, so no chiral center.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier analysis. Now I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the middle carbon is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That gives four different substituents: yes, a chiral center. So option 2 would have optical isomerism.

This is a bit of a problem because the structure affects the answer. So, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the assumption that option 2 has a chiral center, the answer would include option 2.

So, among the options, option D (1 and 2) would include both. But I'm not certain about option 1.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a CH=CH group in a trans configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, so the two ester groups are mirror images. So the molecule is achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here.

Perhaps I should make a conclusion. Based on the analysis, option 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Option 1: not sure, but perhaps it's symmetric, so no. So the correct answer would be only option 2. But the options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, looking back, option A is 1,2,4. But I thought 4 didn't have isomerism. Option D is 1 and 2. If 1 does have isomerism and 2 does, then D is correct.

But I'm not confident about option 1. Alternatively, perhaps option 4 has isomerism, which I missed.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is an example of a compound with a double bond, but no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Then, the only one that has optical isomerism is option 2.

But the options don't include an option with only 2. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, if only 2 has optical isomerism, but none of the options have that, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps option 1 has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If each of the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of each ring, creating an asymmetric arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged so that the molecule is a meso compound, which is achiral.

But without a clear diagram, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a mirror plane that goes through the central bond and the midpoints of the substituents.

In that case, the molecule would be achiral.

So, I'm stuck between whether option 1 has isomerism or not.

But I think the correct answer is option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Wait, no, I thought option 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think about the structure of fumarate again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, and in the dimethyl ester, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, in reality, in the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but the central two carbons are part of a double bond, so they can't be chiral centers.

So, option 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

Thus, the only compound that definitely has a chiral center is option 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D.

But which option includes 2? A and D.

Option A includes 1,2,4.

Option D includes 1 and 2.

Since I'm not sure about 1, perhaps I should assume that option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, making only option 2 correct. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: some compounds can exhibit optical isomerism even without a chiral center, but that's not possible. So, the only way is via a chiral center or a different kind of isomerism like axial chirality.

Wait, axial chirality occurs in compounds like biphenyls where the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. In such cases, the molecule can be chiral even without a chiral center.

So, for biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can exhibit axial chirality.

In the given compound, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetric, then it can have axial chirality and exhibit optical isomerism.

So, perhaps option 1 has axial chirality and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

So, if option 1 and option 2 both have optical isomerism, then the correct option is D.

So, putting it all together:

Option 1: axial chirality (if substituents are arranged asymmetrically) → optical isomerism.

Option 2: chiral center → optical isomerism.

Options 3 and 4: no.

So, the answer would be D: 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1,1'-positions, with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The nitro and carboxylate groups are meta to each other on each ring. The arrangement of substituents can lead to axial chirality if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Since the substituents on each ring are not necessarily symmetrically arranged, this compound can exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester, with the structure O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3). The central carbons in the double bond are not chiral centers because they are double-bonded and cannot rotate. Additionally, the molecule is symmetric, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
- **Option 1** exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- **Option 2** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- **Option 3** and **Option 4** do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
