Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because relativistic effects come into play. Alright, let me try to break this down.

The problem says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the first part is about relative speed. I think in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is different. The formula I recall is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me make sure I get this right. But wait, both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So v1 is faster than v2, so the relative speed from the perspective of the second astronaut (who is moving at 0.5c) would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3) = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. That rules out some options. Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v²/c² is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 -0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is about 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = approximately 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.1547 *3 is 3.4641, yes. So E2 is around 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So the total energy should be about 5.96 mc² and the relative speed is 0.14c. So that points to option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculations. Gamma for 0.6c: (0.6c)^2 = 0.36c², so 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root is 0.8, so gamma is 1.25. So E1 is 2m *1.25 c² = 2.5 mc². That's correct.

For 0.5c: (0.5)^2 =0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)= (√3)/2 ≈0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈1.1547, yes. So 3m *1.1547 c² is 3*1.1547=3.4641 mc². So 2.5 +3.4641=5.9641, which is about 5.96 mc². So option C is correct.

Looking back at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
