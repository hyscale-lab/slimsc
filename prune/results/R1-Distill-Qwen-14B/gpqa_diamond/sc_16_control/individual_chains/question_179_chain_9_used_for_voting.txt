Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of matrices and their properties in this context. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The problem is about identifying which statement among the options A-D is correct based on these matrices.

Let me first list out the options to understand what each is claiming.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Option B: (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

So I need to figure out which of these statements is correct.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix, and the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix (times some factor) is unitary. Also, the state vectors must have unit norm.

Let me tackle each option one by one.

Starting with Option C: Z and X represent observables. Observables are Hermitian, so I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose.

Looking at matrix X:

X = [i, -1, 2i;
      1, 0, 1;
      2i, -1, -i]

The conjugate transpose of X would swap rows and columns and take the complex conjugate of each element.

So the conjugate of X would be:

- The (1,1) element is i, so its conjugate is -i.
- (1,2) is -1 → remains -1.
- (1,3) is 2i → -2i.
- (2,1) is 1.
- (2,2) is 0.
- (2,3) is 1.
- (3,1) is 2i → -2i.
- (3,2) is -1 → -1.
- (3,3) is -i → i.

So the conjugate transpose of X would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, wait—I think I made a mistake. Let me write X correctly and then its conjugate transpose.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate of each element:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Transposing these:

The conjugate transpose would be:

First column: i, 1, 2i → becomes first row after transpose. Wait, no. Wait, transpose swaps rows and columns.

Wait, the conjugate transpose (adjoint) of X is the transpose of the conjugate of X.

So, first, take the conjugate of X:

Each element a_ij becomes a_ij*.

X*, the conjugate of X:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Now transpose this matrix. So, the first row becomes the first column, etc.

So the transpose (X^†):

Column 1: -i, 1, -2i → becomes row 1.
Column 2: -1, 0, -1 → becomes row 2.
Column 3: -2i, 1, i → becomes row 3.

So X^† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare this to the original X:

Original X was:
Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0, 1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

So X^† is not equal to X. For example, element (1,1) of X^† is -i, whereas X has i there. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, X cannot be an observable. So option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian. So C is wrong.

Now, what about Z? Let me check if Z is Hermitian.

Z is given as:

Z = (3, 2i, 5;
      -2i, -2, -4i;
      5, 4i, 4)

So let's compute Z^†.

First, take the conjugate of each element:

Row1: 3, -2i,5
Row2: 2i, -2,4i
Row3:5, -4i,4

Then transpose, making rows into columns.

So Z^† would be:

Column1 becomes row1:3, 2i,5
Column2 becomes row2: -2i, -2,4i
Column3 becomes row3:5,4i,4

So Z^† is:

Row1: 3, 2i,5
Row2: -2i, -2,4i
Row3:5,4i,4

Compare this to original Z:

Original Z:
Row1:3, 2i,5
Row2:-2i, -2, -4i
Row3:5,4i,4

So Z^† is:

Row2 of Z^† is -2i, -2,4i. But in Z, row 2 is -2i, -2, -4i. So the third element in row2 is 4i in Z^†, and -4i in Z. So Z^† is not equal to Z. Therefore, Z is not Hermitian either. So option C says Z and X are observables, but both are not Hermitian. So C is incorrect.

Moving on to option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is unitary, which means U U† = I. So U must satisfy U^† U = I.

Additionally, for the evolution operator, it's usually of the form e^{-iHt} where H is Hermitian. So the matrix exponent is of a Hermitian matrix multiplied by -i t.

But wait, the matrices W and X aren't necessarily exponentials yet; the question is whether they could be evolution operators, which would require them to be unitary.

So let's check if W and X are unitary.

First, check W:

W = [0,0,1;
     0,1,0;
     1,0,0]

To check if it's unitary, compute W^† W and see if it's identity.

Compute W^†: since W is real and symmetric, W^† = W.

So W^† W = W^2.

Compute W squared:

W^2 = W * W.

Compute each element.

Multiplying W by W:

Row 1: [0 0 1] multiplied by each column.

- Column 1 of W: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 =1 → so (1,1) is 1.
- Column 2: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0 → (1,2)=0.
- Column3: 0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0 → (1,3)=0.

Row 2: [0 1 0]

- Col1: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0.
- Col2:0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.
- Col3:0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

Row3: [1 0 0]

- Col1:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0.
- Col2:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.
- Col3:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So W^2 is:

[1 0 0;
0 1 0;
0 0 1]

Which is the identity matrix. So W^† W = I → W is unitary.

So W is a unitary matrix. That's a good sign for option D.

Now check X: is X unitary?

Compute X^† X and see if it's identity.

X is the matrix:

Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0,1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

First, compute X^†. Which is the conjugate transpose.

X^†:

Row1: -i, 1, 2i → (from X's first column)
Row2: -1, 0, -1 → (from X's second column)
Row3: -2i,1, i → (from X's third column)

Wait, wait, let me make sure.

X^† is the conjugate of each element, then transpose.

Original X:

Row1: i, -1, 2i → so their conjugates are -i, -1, -2i.
Row2:1,0,1 → conjugates 1,0,1.
Row3:2i, -1, -i → conjugates -2i, -1, i.

Then transpose, so rows become columns.

So X^†:

Column1: i becomes row1, column1. Wait no, transpose swaps rows and columns.

Wait, X is:

Columns:

Col1: i, 1, 2i
Col2: -1, 0, -1
Col3:2i, 1, -i

Conjugate of each:

Col1: -i,1,-2i
Col2: -1,0,-1
Col3: -2i,1,i

Then when transposed, X^† is:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i
Row2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: -2i, -1, i

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, take the conjugate of each element first:

X^*:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i
Row2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose X^*:

The first row of X^* is [-i, -1, -2i], which becomes the first column of X^†.

X^†:

Column 1 becomes row1: [-i, 1, -2i]
Column 2 becomes row2: [-1, 0, -1]
Column3 becomes row3: [-2i,1,i]

So X^† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i,1,i

Now compute X^† X.

Compute each element of the resulting matrix.

Let me compute (X^† X)_{1,1}:

Row1 of X^†: [-i, 1, -2i]
Column1 of X: [i, 1, 2i]

Dot product: (-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
Compute each term:

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) =1.

(1)(1)=1.

(-2i)(2i) = -4 i² = -4*(-1)=4.

Adding them: 1 +1 +4 =6.

So (1,1) element is 6.

Next, (1,2) element: row1 of X^† dotted with column2 of X.

Column2 of X: [-1, 0, -1]

Dot product: (-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(-1)
= i + 0 + 2i = 3i.

(1,3) element: row1 of X^†.col3 of X.

Column3 of X: [2i,1,-i]

Dot product: (-i)(2i) + 1*1 + (-2i)(-i)

Compute each term:

(-i)(2i) = -2 i² = 2 (since i²=-1).

1*1=1.

(-2i)(-i) = 2 i² = -2.

So total: 2 +1 -2 =1.

Wait, wait, let me recompute that.

First term: (-i)(2i) = (-2 i^2) = 2 because i²=-1.

Second term: 1*1=1.

Third term: (-2i)(-i) = 2 i² = 2*(-1) = -2.

So sum is 2 +1 -2 =1.

So (1,3) is 1.

Now, let's compute the second row, first column (2,1) of X^† X.

Row2 of X^†: [-1, 0, -1]
Column1 of X: [i,1,2i]

Dot product: (-1)(i) + 0*1 + (-1)(2i)
= -i + 0 -2i = -3i.

(2,2) element: row2 X^† dot column2 X.

Row2: [-1,0,-1]
Column2: [-1,0,-1]

Dot product: (-1)(-1) +0*0 + (-1)(-1) =1 +0 +1=2.

(2,3) element: row2 X^† dot column3 X.

Row2: [-1,0,-1]
Column3: [2i,1,-i]

Dot product: (-1)(2i) +0*1 + (-1)(-i) = -2i +0 +i = -i.

Third row of X^† X:

Row3 X^†: [-2i,1,i]
Column1 X: [i,1,2i]

Dot product: (-2i)(i) + (1)(1) + i*(2i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + 2i²
= (2) +1 + (-2) = 1.

Row3, column2: row3 X^† dot column2 X.

Column2 X is [-1,0,-1]

Dot product: (-2i)(-1) +1*0 +i*(-1) = 2i +0 -i= i.

Row3, column3: row3 X^† dot column3 X.

Column3 X: [2i,1,-i]

Dot product: (-2i)(2i) +1*(1) +i*(-i)
= (-4 i²) +1 + (-i²)
= 4 (since i²=-1) +1 + (1) since (-i^2) is -(-1)=1.
Wait, let me compute each term:

(-2i)(2i) = (-4 i²) = -4*(-1)=4.

1*1=1.

i*(-i)= -i²= -(-1)=1.

Sum:4+1+1=6.

So putting it all together, X^† X is:

Row1: 6, 3i, 1
Row2: -3i, 2, -i
Row3:1, i,6

Now, this is definitely not the identity matrix because the (1,1) element is 6, not 1. So X is not unitary. Therefore, option D is incorrect because X isn't unitary. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait a second. The evolution operator is usually unitary, but X isn't. So W is unitary, but X isn't. So W can be an evolution operator, but X can't. So option D says both W and X are evolution operators. But since X isn't, D is incorrect.

So D is not correct.

Now, let's check option B: (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, quantum states are represented by vectors with unit norm, but this is a matrix product. Alternatively, perhaps the option is referring to whether this product is a valid quantum state when considering it as an operator, but I'm not quite sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether it's a unitary matrix, but that's not directly relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is referring to whether the transformed Y by X is an observable or something else. Hmm. Wait, another thought: in quantum mechanics, the adjoint action of the exponential of an operator (like e^X) on another operator Y gives rise to a similar operator. But whether the product is a quantum state... I'm a bit confused.

Wait, a quantum state is a vector, not a matrix. So the product (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a matrix. So if Y is an observable, and X is perhaps a unitary, then this transformation would give another observable. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a state vector, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the product (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is supposed to be a density matrix, which is a state. But density matrices are positive semi-definite and Hermitian. Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether the product is a valid state vector, but state vectors are usually column vectors with unit norm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether this product is unitary. Let me think: if X is unitary, then e^{X} might be unitary as well, but X in this case isn't unitary, as we saw earlier.

Wait, but in any case, the product (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) would be a matrix, but whether it represents a quantum state depends on the context. Quantum states can be represented as vectors (kets) or density matrices, which are matrices. But a single matrix operation like this might not directly correspond to a state unless it's a density matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression represents a time evolution of an observable Y under the operator e^X, but I'm not sure if this is directly a state. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this option, so perhaps I should move on and come back.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

The norm of a vector after multiplication by a matrix depends on the matrix's properties. If the matrix is unitary, then the norm remains the same because unitary matrices preserve the inner product. If the matrix isn't unitary, then it can change the norm.

So, if e^X is not unitary, then there exists a vector where the norm changes upon multiplication by e^X.

Wait, but X isn't unitary, as we saw earlier. So what about e^X? If X is not Hermitian, then e^X isn't necessarily unitary. But even if X is Hermitian, e^X would be unitary only if X is anti-Hermitian (X† = -X), which is a condition for the exponential to be unitary. Because if X is anti-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary.

Wait, let's think mathematically. A matrix U is unitary if U† U = I. If we have U = e^A, then U† U = e^{A†} e^{A} = e^{A† + A}.

For this to be I, we need A† + A = 0, which implies A is anti-Hermitian (A† = -A).

So, if X is anti-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. But X in this case isn't anti-Hermitian. Let me check.

Is X anti-Hermitian? A matrix is anti-Hermitian if X† = -X.

We computed X^† earlier and found it to be:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i,1,i

If X is anti-Hermitian, then X^† should be equal to -X.

Original X:

Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0,1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

-X:

Row1: -i,1,-2i
Row2:-1,0,-1
Row3:-2i,1,i

Compare this to X^† which we calculated as:

Row1: -i,1,-2i
Row2:-1,0,-1
Row3:-2i,1,i

So yes, X^† equals -X. So X is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, that's interesting. So X is anti-Hermitian. Therefore, e^X is unitary. Because for any anti-Hermitian matrix X, e^{X} is unitary.

Wait, so e^{X} is unitary because X is anti-Hermitian.

So if e^X is unitary, then for any vector v, the norm after multiplication by e^X would remain the same. Because unitary operators preserve the norm. Therefore, there does not exist any vector where the norm changes upon multiplication by e^X. So option A would be false.

Wait, but wait. Wait, X is anti-Hermitian, which implies that X† = -X. Therefore, e^{X} is unitary. So e^X is a unitary matrix, which preserves the norm of any vector. Therefore, option A says that there exists a vector where the norm changes, which would be false.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Did I make a mistake in determining whether X is anti-Hermitian?

Wait, let me recheck.

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0,1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

X^† is:

Row1: -i,1,-2i
Row2:-1,0,-1
Row3:-2i,1,i

If I multiply X by -1, what do I get?

-X:

Row1: -i,1,-2i
Row2:-1,0,-1
Row3:-2i,1,i

Which is exactly X^†. So X^† = -X → X is anti-Hermitian.

So e^X is unitary. Therefore, e^X preserves the norm of any vector. So option A's statement is incorrect. So A is false.

Wait, but that seems conflicting because I thought earlier that X is not Hermitian. But that's correct, because anti-Hermitian implies X† = -X, which is different from Hermitian (X†=X).

So, in that case, e^X is unitary, so the norm doesn't change. So option A is false because there's no such vector. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Hmm, but this is conflicting with what I thought earlier about option D. But regardless, let me recap.

So far, options C and D are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because e^X is unitary, so the norm doesn't change.

That leaves option B as the only possible correct statement.

Wait, let me reevaluate option B.

Option B: (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, a quantum state is usually a vector (ket) or a density matrix. But this is a product of matrices. Let me think: if Y is an observable, and e^X is a unitary operator (since X is anti-Hermitian), then (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) would be similar to Y, and thus also an observable. So perhaps this represents another observable, but not a state.

Alternatively, perhaps this transformation is part of the Heisenberg picture, where observables evolve under the adjoint action of the time evolution operator. But in that case, the transformed Y would still be an observable, not a state.

Wait, but the question is whether it represents a quantum state. Quantum states can be represented as vectors (with norm 1) or as density matrices (positive semi-definite, Hermitian, trace 1).

But (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a matrix. So it could be a state only if it's a density matrix. So is Y a density matrix? Let me check.

Y is given as:

Y = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2;
     0.1, 0.25, 0.1;
     0.2, 0.1, 0.25)

I can check if Y is Hermitian and positive semi-definite.

Is Y Hermitian? Y is symmetric, and since all elements are real, Y is Hermitian.

Is Y positive semi-definite? We can check its eigenvalues. Alternatively, check if all the leading minors are positive.

The first minor is 0.5 >0.

The second leading minor is determinant of the top-left 2x2:

(0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 -0.01 = 0.115 >0.

The determinant of Y: I'm not sure, but perhaps it's positive. Let me compute.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that Y looks like a valid density matrix. So Y might be a density matrix.

If Y is a density matrix, then (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) would also be a density matrix since unitary transformations preserve the properties of density matrices. Because e^X is unitary, so the transformed Y would still be a density matrix, hence a valid quantum state.

Wait, but wait: when you have a density matrix ρ and apply a unitary U, the transformed state is U ρ U†. So in this case, the expression is e^X Y e^{-X}.

Which is the same as U Y U†, where U = e^X.

Since U is unitary, this transformation is valid, and the resulting matrix is also a density matrix. Therefore, option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in the Heisenberg picture, but I think in this context, the option B is correct because the product is a density matrix, hence a quantum state.

So, to recap:

Option B is correct because (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) would be a valid quantum state, assuming Y is a density matrix.

Wait, but I should double-check whether Y is indeed a density matrix. A density matrix must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1.

The trace of Y is 0.5 +0.25 +0.25 = 1. So trace is correct.

As for positive semi-definite, the matrix Y is symmetric with positive eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant to check if it's positive.

Compute determinant of Y:

Using the formula for 3x3 matrices:

|Y| = 0.5*(0.25*0.25 - 0.1*0.1) - 0.1*(0.1*0.25 - 0.1*0.2) + 0.2*(0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2)

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

Compute:

a = 0.5
b = 0.1
c = 0.2
d = 0.1
e = 0.25
f = 0.1
g = 0.2
h = 0.1
i = 0.25

The determinant formula is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

So:

0.5*(0.25*0.25 - 0.1*0.1) - 0.1*(0.1*0.25 -0.1*0.2) + 0.2*(0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2)

Compute each part:

First term: 0.5*(0.0625 - 0.01) = 0.5*(0.0525) = 0.02625.

Second term: -0.1*(0.025 - 0.02) = -0.1*(0.005) = -0.0005.

Third term: 0.2*(0.01 - 0.05) = 0.2*(-0.04)= -0.008.

So sum up: 0.02625 -0.0005 -0.008 = 0.02625 -0.0085 = 0.01775.

Which is positive. So determinant is positive. Also, all the leading minors are positive, so Y is positive definite. Thus, Y is a valid density matrix.

Therefore, (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) would be another density matrix, hence a valid quantum state. So option B is correct.

So the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct statement about the given matrices, we analyze each option systematically:

### Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies \( e^X \), the norm of the vector changes.
- The matrix \( X \) is anti-Hermitian, as \( X^\dagger = -X \). This implies \( e^X \) is unitary.
- Unitary matrices preserve the norm of any vector they act upon. Therefore, there does not exist a vector where the norm changes after multiplication by \( e^X \).
- **Conclusion**: Option A is incorrect.

### Option B: \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a quantum state.
- A quantum state can be represented as a density matrix, which must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have trace 1.
- The matrix \( Y \) is symmetric and real, making it Hermitian. Its trace is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \), and all leading minors are positive, confirming it is positive semi-definite. Thus, \( Y \) is a valid density matrix.
- The matrix \( e^X \) is unitary because \( X \) is anti-Hermitian. Unitary transformations preserve the properties of density matrices, so \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is also a valid density matrix.
- **Conclusion**: Option B is correct.

### Option C: \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables.
- Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. A matrix is Hermitian if \( M^\dagger = M \).
- For \( X \), \( X^\dagger \neq X \), so \( X \) is not Hermitian.
- For \( Z \), \( Z^\dagger \neq Z \), so \( Z \) is not Hermitian either.
- **Conclusion**: Option C is incorrect.

### Option D: \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.
- The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is unitary, meaning \( U U^\dagger = I \).
- For \( W \), \( W^\dagger W = I \), so \( W \) is unitary.
- For \( X \), \( X^\dagger X \neq I \), so \( X \) is not unitary.
- Since \( X \) is not unitary, it cannot represent the evolution operator.
- **Conclusion**: Option D is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is a valid quantum state.

**Answer: B**
