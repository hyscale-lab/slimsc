Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both planets were already found via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the problem states that both planets have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star, right?

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but maybe Planet_1's star is a bit evolved or something, but in this case, both have the same radius. Hmm, that might affect the transit probability.

So, the main thing here is figuring out the transit probability for each planet. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the star's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a_planet / (a_planet * (1 - e^2)^0.5))... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing some terms. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), but wait, no, that can't be right. Oh wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Or perhaps the probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, no, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a_p) / (a_p) )... Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p ) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps another way. Let me think about the geometry.

The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star (as seen from Earth) relative to the planet's orbital distance. The probability is roughly the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbit, but I think it's actually the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, multiplied by some factor.

Wait, no. I think the formula for the probability that a planet transits is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a_p) ) , but wait, that's not making sense with units. Maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p )

Because the planet needs to pass in front of the star. The area for the transit is the star's disk, and the planet's orbital path needs to cross that disk. The probability is proportional to the area of the star relative to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, the area of the star is π (R_s)^2, and the area of the planet's orbit is π (a_p)^2. So the probability would be approximately (R_s / a_p)^2, but that's not considering the planet's size because if the planet is much smaller than the star, that factor is just 1. Wait, no, the planet's size matters as well because if the planet is too small compared to the star, the chance of it blocking the star's light is lower, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The transit probability (P) is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our line of sight. The formula is:

P ≈ (R_p + R_s) / a_p

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Another approach: The probability that the planet transits is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance, squared. Because the planet needs to cross the star's disk. So the probability is proportional to (2 R_s / (2 a_p))^2 = (R_s / a_p)^2.

Wait, but wait, the planet's size also matters because if the planet is too big, it's more likely to block the star. So maybe P is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p)^2? Or perhaps it's (R_p + R_s) / a_p? I'm not confident. Maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) )

Wait, no. Let me think differently. Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but that can't be right because the orbit is much larger than the star. Oh wait, no, the area of the disk where the planet can be in front of the star is a circle with diameter equal to the star's diameter. So the probability is the ratio of the star's area (π R_s²) to the planet's orbit area (π a_p²), which would be (R_s / a_p)^2. But that would make the probability very small for most planets, which is correct because transits are rare events.

But wait, we also have to consider the planet's size because only when the planet is larger relative to the star does the transit become more noticeable. So, the probability also depends on the planet's radius squared. So maybe the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p)^2.

Wait, that would be (R_p^2 * R_s^2) / (R_s^2 a_p^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a_p^2). Hmm, that's interesting. So P = (R_p / a_p )^2. But that doesn't include the star's radius. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me refer to what I know. The transit probability is actually given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 / (1 - e^2)) * (1 / (1 + (a_p (1 - e) / R_s)) ) )

But since both planets have circular orbits (e=0), this simplifies. So in the case of a circular orbit, the probability becomes P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a_p )

So, P = (R_p^2) / R_s^2 * (R_s / a_p ) ) = R_p^2 / ( R_s a_p )

Hmm, that makes sense. Because if the planet is farther away (larger a_p), the probability decreases. If the planet is larger (larger R_p), the probability increases. Also, if the star is larger (larger R_s), the probability increases because R_s is in the denominator.

Wait, but in our case, the planets are Earth-like, so their radii are similar. The question says both planets have Earth-like masses, but does that mean their radii are similar? Well, yes, because for planets of the same mass, if they are Earth-like, their radii would be similar.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that R_p is the same for both planets. Oh, the question says "Earth-like planets," but it's possible that they could have similar R_p. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that R_p is the same for both.

So, if R_p for both planets is the same, then the transit probability for each planet would be:

P = (R_p^2) / ( R_s * a_p )

So, for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

P1 = (R_p^2) / ( R_s1 * a1 )

P2 = (R_p^2) / ( R_s2 * a2 )

But wait, the question states that both planets have the same mass. But mass relates to radius for planets. For Earth-like planets, mass and radius are related because density is similar, but the problem doesn't state that their radii are the same. Hmm. Wait, the question doesn't state that the planet radii are the same, only that their masses are the same. So, if they have the same mass but different compositions, their radii could vary. But in this case, since they're Earth-like, perhaps we can assume that their radii are similar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the planet radius because it's the same for both.

Wait, but the problem says "Earth-like planets," which implies similar radii. So maybe R_p is the same for both. So, moving on.

We have two planets:

Planet_1: Host star mass is twice that of Planet_2's host. Both stars have same radius, R_s.

Wait, so R_s is the same for both stars. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, for Planet_1:

a1 is the orbital distance. Wait, Kepler's third law says that a^3 is proportional to (M_star) * P^2.

Wait, for a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-major axis a is determined by the mass of the star and the orbital period. The formula is a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4 π²). So, a = [ (G M_star P^2) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But since both planets have known orbital periods, we can find a1 and a2.

Wait, Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2. The question says that P1 is three times shorter than P2. So, P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, let me make it clear. Let me set P2 = 3 * P1.

Wait, no, the question says that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 = (1/3) P2.

So, P2 = 3 * P1.

So, a1 and a2 can be found using Kepler's third law.

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2) / (4 π² )

Given that M1 = 2 M2 (since the star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star).

So, M1 = 2 M2.

P2 = 3 P1.

So, substituting into a2^3:

a2^3 = (G M2 (3 P1)^2 ) / (4 π² ) = (G M2 * 9 P1^2 ) / (4 π² )

a1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * P1^2 ) / (4 π² )

So, a1^3 = (2 G M2 P1² ) / (4 π² ) = ( G M2 P1² ) * (2) / (4 π² ) )

Wait, simplifying a1^3 and a2^3:

a1^3 = (2 G M2 P1²) / (4 π²) ) = (G M2 P1^2 * 2 ) / (4 π² ) ) = (G M2 P1^2 ) * (1/2) ) / π².

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute a2^3 / a1^3.

Let me compute (a2^3)/(a1^3):

a2^3 = [ G M2 (3 P1)^2 ] / (4 π² ) = G M2 9 P1² / (4 π² )

a1^3 = [ G (2 M2) P1^2 ] / (4 π² ) = 2 G M2 P1² / (4 π² )

So, (a2^3)/(a1^3) = [ G M2 9 P1² / (4 π² ) ] / [ 2 G M2 P1² / (4 π² ) ] ) = [ 9 G M2 P1² * 4 π² ] / [ 2 G M2 P1² *4 π² ] ) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, (a2^3) is numerator: G M2 (3 P1)^2 = G M2 *9 P1².

Denominator for a2^3 is 4 π².

Similarly, a1^3 is (2 G M2 P1^2) / (4 π² ).

So,

(a2^3) / (a1^3) = [ (G M2 * 9 P1² ) / (4 π²) ) ] / [ (2 G M2 P1² ) / (4 π²) ) ]

The G, M2, P1², and 4 π² terms cancel out.

So, 9 / 2 = 4.5.

So, (a2^3)/(a1^3) = 9/2 =4.5 → a2/a1 = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So, a2 = a1 * 1.65 approximately.

So, a2 is longer than a1 by a factor of about 1.65.

But wait, let me do the exact calculation.

Cube root of 9/2. Let's compute 9/2 is 4.5.

Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.6506.

So, a2 ≈ 1.6506 * a1.

So, a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

So, now, back to transit probability.

P = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a_p )

But for both planets, R_p is the same (assuming Earth-like and same mass → same radius?), R_s is same for both.

So, P1 = (R_p^2) / (R_s a1 )

P2 = (R_p^2) / (R_s a2 )

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (1 / a2) / (1 / a1 ) ) = a1 / a2.

Which is 1 / 1.6506 ≈ 0.605.

So, P2 is about 0.605 times P1.

Wait, that would mean P1 is higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If a2=1.65 a1, then 1/a2 is 1/(1.65 a1) = (1/a1) * (1/1.65 )

So, P2 = (R_p^2 / R_s ) * (1/a2 ) → same as (R_p^2 / R_s a2 )

Similarly, P1 is (R_p^2 / R_s a1 )

So, P2 = P1 * (a1 / a2 )

But a1/a2 is 1/1.6506 → approx 0.605.

So, P2 ≈ 0.605 * P1 → P1 is higher.

So, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

But wait, that's if R_p is the same for both. What if R_p is not the same? The question says both planets have the same mass, but not necessarily the same radius. For Earth-like planets, higher mass usually implies larger radius, but I'm not sure if the problem expects us to treat R_p as the same or different.

Wait, the question says "Earth-like planets" with the same mass. So, perhaps they have the same radius as well. So, R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

Thus, the transit probability for each is P1 = R_p²/(R_s a1 ), P2= R_p²/(R_s a2 )

As above, a2=1.65 a1 → a1 = a2/1.65.

So, P1 = R_p²/(R_s a1 ) = R_p²/(R_s (a2/1.65)) )= (1.65 R_p² )/( R_s a2 )

But P2= R_p²/( R_s a2 )

So, P1 = 1.65 * P2.

So, Planet_1's probability is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Which would mean that the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, so according to the calculation, P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

But wait, let me go back through the steps.

Wait, earlier I found a2 = 1.65 a1.

So, a2 is longer than a1.

So, in the transit probability formula, a larger a_p means a lower probability.

So, a2 is 1.65 a1 → P2 = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a2 ) → P2 = P1 * (a1 / a2 ) → 0.605 P1.

So, P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So, the probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.

Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option A says Planet_2 is preferred with ~2.25 times higher.

Option B says Planet_2 with ~1.5.

Option D says Planet_1 with ~2.7.

So, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P = \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a_p}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a_p\) is the planet's orbital distance. The key factors influencing the transit probability are the orbital distance \(a_p\) and the star's radius \(R_s\). Since both planets are Earth-like, we assume \(R_p\) is the same for both, and the problem states \(R_s\) is the same for both stars.

### Orbital Distance Calculation
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a_p\) is proportional to:

\[
a_p^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

where \(M_s\) is the star's mass and \(P\) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\)).
- Planet_1's orbital period is one-third of Planet_2's (\(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\)).

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2}{M_{s1} \cdot P_1^2} = \frac{M_{s2} \cdot (3P_1)^2}{2M_{s2} \cdot P_1^2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \sqrt[3]{4.5} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, \(a_2 \approx 1.65a_1\).

### Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance (\(P \propto \frac{1}{a_p}\)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
