Okay, so I'm faced with this quantum mechanics question. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, can be known simultaneously.

The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I should recall the exact expression. Oh right, the uncertainty principle for energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ / 2. Sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, but I think the exact factor might not matter as much for this problem since it's a multiple-choice question.

So, the lifetime here refers to the time for which the energy state can be measured. Or wait, more accurately, the lifetime of a state is the time it takes for the state to decay, so the uncertainty in time Δt is related to that. The longer the lifetime (Δt), the more precisely we can know the energy (smaller ΔE), and vice versa.

Wait, but the question is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or maybe it's more about the energy resolution required. Let me think.

If you have two states with energies E1 and E2, their energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each so that they can be resolved. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. So for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(1e-9). And for the second state, Δt2 = 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8).

Wait, but for each state, the uncertainty in energy is proportional to 1/Δt. So the first state has a larger ΔE because its lifetime is shorter. So the energy resolution required to distinguish E1 and E2 would depend on which of the two has the larger uncertainty.

Wait, but the two states have their own uncertainties. But when you are measuring the energy transition between them, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum of the two?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum energy difference that can be resolved is determined by the uncertainty of the measurement. Let's think about the measurement process. The energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement for it to be distinguishable.

Wait, but the measurement's time is related to the states' lifetimes. If the experiment's measurement time is similar to the lifetimes of the states, then the uncertainty in energy would be based on that.

Wait, maybe I should compute the uncertainty in energy for each state and then make sure that the energy difference is larger than the smaller of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum.

Wait, let's get back to the problem. The question is about the energy difference that allows to clearly resolve the two levels. So, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is below the uncertainty, the two states would blend and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state has its own uncertainty. If the energy difference between the two is larger than both uncertainties, then you can distinguish them. Because the energy of each state is a distribution around their mean. So if the means are separated by more than the sum of their uncertainties, the distributions don't overlap, making them distinguishable.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the rule that the energy difference should be at least the maximum of the two uncertainties for the states. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler, considering the energy uncertainty of each state. Let's compute the uncertainty for each.

So the Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Reduced Planck constant ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But since we're working in eV, perhaps it's better to convert ħ into eV·s.

I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So, let's compute ħ in eV·s.

ħ ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV·s.

Calculating that: 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, the uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ.

So for the first state, Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 0.6582e-6 eV, which is about 0.658 microvolts. Hmm, but wait, the options are in 1e-4, 1e-8, etc. So 6.58e-7 eV is 6.58e-7 eV, which is 1e-6 order of magnitude.

But wait, the second state has Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

So ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty for the first state is about 6.58e-7 eV and for the second, 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so the first state has a much larger uncertainty. So for the energy difference between E1 and E2 to be distinguishable, it must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two?

Wait, no, I think the required condition is that the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. Because when you measure the energy transition between the two states, the measurement's time is related to the lifetimes of the states, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the measurement time is the time for which you can observe the state, which is the lifetime of the state. So if you have a state with a longer lifetime, you can measure its energy more precisely.

But in this question, we have two states, each with their own lifetimes. The question is about the energy difference between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is less than either uncertainty, then the two states would not be resolvable.

Wait, but the first state has a larger uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the larger uncertainty. Because otherwise, the measurement can't differentiate between the two states.

Wait, no, think about two peaks on a spectrum. Each peak has a certain linewidth (which is the uncertainty in energy). For the peaks to be distinguishable, the separation between their centers (ΔE) must be greater than the sum of their linewidths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Because if the separation is less than the sum, the peaks would overlap.

Wait, for example, suppose ΔE1 is 1 and ΔE2 is 2. Then, the minimum ΔE between the two to be resolved is when ΔE > 1+2=3. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

So in this case, ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the minimum ΔE needed is around 7.24e-7 eV. But looking at the options, the largest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV. Let me check the numbers:

Wait 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So 1e-4 eV is larger than 7.24e-7 eV, so it's sufficient.

But wait, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV — that's 0.000000001 eV. That's way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV — even smaller, so worse.

C) 1e-4 eV — 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than needed.

D) 1e-8 eV — 0.00000001 eV. Also too small.

So the correct answer would be C) 1e-4 eV. Because it's the only option larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, which is about 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, which one is larger than that?

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724. So 1e-4 is much larger, so it's sufficient.

But wait, the other options are all smaller than this, except C.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, ħ is about 6.58e-16 eV·s.

For Δt1 = 1e-9 s: ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1 ≈ 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.

Δt2 = 1e-8 s: ΔE2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than 7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4=1e-4=1e-4=0.0001 eV.

Which is much larger than 7.238e-7 eV, which is 0.0000007238 eV.

So option C is acceptable.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. The condition for resolution is that the energy difference must be at least the sum of the uncertainties of the two states.

So if the energy difference is larger than the sum, the two states can be clearly resolved.

Therefore, the energy difference must be ≥ 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than 7.24e-7, so it satisfies the condition.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me consider if the answer is option C or another. Wait, looking at the options:

The options are: A is 1e-9, B is 1e-11, C is 1e-4, D is 1e-8.

So C is much larger than the required 7.24e-7 eV (which is 7.24e-7 eV is 0.000000724 eV, and option C is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger than 7.24e-7, because 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4 and 7.24e-7 is 0.724e-6. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6.

Wait, so 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 7.24e-7? Let me compute:

7.24e-7 eV = 0.724e-6 eV.

1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 100e-6 eV.

So 100e-6 eV is way bigger than 0.724e-6, so yes, it's sufficient.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (related to the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For practical purposes, we approximate \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \Delta t \).

### Step 1: Compute the uncertainties for each state
The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate the energy uncertainties:

1. For the first state:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The energy difference must be larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two states are distinguishable. Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that ensures the energy difference is large enough to clearly distinguish the two states is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
