Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the object is far away, and vice versa.

Wait, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. That means if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I think I need to express N in terms of distance d, not parallax. Let's see.

Given that N ∝ 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Oh wait, no, wait: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 over that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so maybe the number in a range dr increases with d^5. But the options are given in terms of how N changes with r, which I think is the same as d here.

So, the number of stars increases as r^5. Looking at the options, option B is ~r^5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. So, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N = k / plx^5. And plx = 1/d, so N = k * d^5. So, yes, N is proportional to d^5. So, when the distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, is this correct? Because in reality, the number of stars you can see in a region depends on the volume, which is proportional to r^3. But in this case, the given relationship is different. So, I must follow the given relationship.

So the correct answer should be option B, which is ~r^5.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance. Since the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (\( r \)), and \( r \) is equivalent to \( d \), the number of stars increases as \( r^5 \).

From the options provided:
- Option A (\( \sim r^3 \)) and Option D (\( \sim r^2 \)) are incorrect because they do not match the derived relationship.
- Option C (\( \sim r^4 \)) is also incorrect for the same reason.
- Option B (\( \sim r^5 \)) is correct because it aligns with the derived relationship \( N \propto r^5 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
