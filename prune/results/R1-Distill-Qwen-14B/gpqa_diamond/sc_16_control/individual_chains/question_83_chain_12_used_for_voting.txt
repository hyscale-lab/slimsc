Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so their reaction should form the acetate ion and water. Let me think step by step.

First, the problem says we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the initial concentration after dilution would change, right? Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Oh wait, yeah, because concentration is moles per liter. So the new volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, the new volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the volume needed for that. Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So during the titration, after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, how much has reacted?

Wait, so the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, the volume added is 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001. So moles remaining: 0.00075. And moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025.

So the solution now has acetic acid and acetate. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

The concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. The concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733 → wait, no, wait. Let me think. Ka = 1.85x10^-5 → so log(Ka) ≈ 4.733? Wait no, wait. Wait, log(1e-5) is 5. So 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 1e-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(Ka) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733? No, wait, no. Actually, log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → which is 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328. So about 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me calculate that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25.

Now, looking at the options, the first value would be around 4.25. Let's see the options.

Option A:4.26;8.52 → first part matches.

Option D:4.57;6.92 → pH is higher than what I calculated.

Option B:3.17;6.73 → way lower than 4.25.

So for the 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26, which matches option A.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The sodium acetate will dissociate into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So pKb is log(5.405e-10). Let's compute that. Log(5.405)=0.732, so pKb ≈ 9.268. So pOH is 9.268, so pH is 14 - 9.268 ≈ 4.732. Wait, that can't be right because acetate is a base; solution should be basic, pH>7. Hmm, did I get that wrong.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait: if Kb is 5.405e-10, that's a very small Kb, which would mean that the solution is weakly basic. Wait, but that's impossible because acetate is a weak base. Wait, but sometimes when the salt comes from a strong base and a weak acid, the solution is basic. But in this case, the Kb is small, so the solution is only slightly basic.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. So pKb = log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.268. So pOH = 9.268 → pH =14-9.268=4.732. Wait, that's less than 7, which can't be right. Because acetate is a base, so pH should be higher than 7. Oh, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Oh wait, wait, wait. Maybe I got Kb wrong. Or maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me calculate Kb again. Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85)* (1e-14 / 1e-5) ) → 1e-9 / 1.85 → approximately 5.4e-10. So that's correct.

Wait, but the pKb is about 9.268. So pOH is 9.268, which gives pH=4.732, which is acidic. That can't be right because acetate is a base. Hmm, maybe I have it inverted.

Wait, no. Because Kb is for the base, which is acetate. So if Kb is 5.4e-10, then the solution is very slightly basic. Because Kb is very low, the concentration of OH- is low. So the pH would be just below 7? That doesn't make sense because acetate is a base, and I would expect the solution to be basic.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should compute using the concentration of acetate.

Wait, at equivalence point, the volume of the solution is 40 cm³ (original) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³ =0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles (since all acetic acid is neutralized). So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

So the hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]

We can set up an ICE table. Let’s denote the change as x. So:

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] =0.02 M
[CH3COOH]=0
[OH^-] = negligible

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

Equilibrium:
[CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x ≈0.02
[CH3COOH] =x
[OH^-] =x

So Kb = (x^2) / 0.02 ≈5.405e-10.

So x² = 0.02 *5.405e-10 → x²=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.977 → pH=14-4.977=9.023.

Wait, that makes sense because pH is about 9, which is basic. So why did my earlier approach with pOH=9.268 give pH=4.732? Oh wait, I think I confused pKa and pKb earlier. Let me see.

Wait, earlier I thought that the Kb is 5.4e-10, so pKb=9.268, so pOH=9.268, pH=4.732. But that can't be right because the calculation using the concentration gives a pH around 9, not 4.73. So I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.

Ah, I think I see where I went wrong. In the Henderson equation approach, I used the pKa, but for the equivalence point, I have a solution of a base, so I should use the Kb approach instead.

Wait, so let me correct that. So when at equivalence, the solution is of acetate ion. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

So the correct approach is to calculate the pH based on the concentration of acetate and its Kb.

So with the Kb being 5.405e-10 and concentration 0.02 M, we have [OH^-]^2 = Kb * C → [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So pOH is about 4.977, so pH=14-4.977=9.023.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: equivalence point is 8.52 → which is lower than 9.

Option D: equivalence pH 6.92 → also lower than 7, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me double-check.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate. Let's recalculate the moles.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 moles) is neutralized to acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ =50 cm³=0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, but according to this calculation, the pH is approximately 9.02, which isn't in the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D says 6.92 for equivalence. That's way lower than 7, which can't be right if it's acetate solution. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence point is considered as a buffer? No, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So only acetate is present.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I made a mistake in the hydrolysis calculation. Let me try again.

The correct expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

At initial, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02, since x is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=sqrt(1.081e-11)= about 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1/(1.04e-5)) → wait, no, pOH is -log([OH^-]).

So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.977 → pH=14-4.977=9.023.

Hmm, but none of the options have 9.023. Let me look again at the options.

Options:

A) 4.26;8.52 → 8.52 is lower than 9, so no.

D) 4.57;6.92 → no.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles of NaOH. Let me double-check the equivalence point calculation.

The initial acetic acid is 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles NaOH needed: 0.001 moles. Volume V=0.001/0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³. Correct.

So the solution at equivalence point is 0.02 M acetate, 0.05 L (50 cm³).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the dilution correctly. Wait, wait, when you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M. But when adding NaOH, the total volume increases.

Wait, let me think. During the titration, the solution's volume changes. But perhaps the initial dilution is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the buffer method for the equivalence point. No, that's not right. At equivalence, you have a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait, another thought: maybe I'm using the wrong Ka. Let me make sure. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. Correct for acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not 0.02 M. Wait, no, because 0.001 mol in 0.05 L is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the pH at equivalence point using another approach. Let me compute it again.

Given:

Concentration of CH3COO^- =0.02 M.

Kb =5.405e-10.

So:

Kb = (x^2)/0.02 → x^2= 0.02 *5.405e-10=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 M.

pOH =-log(1.04e-5)= about 4.977 → pH=9.023.

Hmm. So none of the options have a pH of about 9.02. But checking the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: when the problem says '25% titration', maybe it refers to 25% of the initial acetic acid volume, not the equivalence point volume.

Wait, the problem says: '25% titration'—I think that refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So that would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, as I calculated before. So the 25% is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me check that again.

At 25% titration, [A-]=0.00025/0.0425= 0.005882 M.

[HA]=0.00075/0.0425=0.017647 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.005882 /0.017647 =0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → pKa is about 4.73.

Log(0.3333)= -0.477 → 4.73 -0.477=4.253 → ~4.25.

So the first part is 4.25, which matches option A (4.26) and option D (4.57). But option D's equivalence point is 6.92, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and acetate. The acetate acts as a base, so the solution is basic.

But according to the calculation, pH is around 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the formula for a weak base. The formula is:

pH = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think. For a weak base, the pH can be approximated if the solution is dilute and the base is weak.

Alternatively, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log C)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. The acetate ion will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M.

Let’s set up the ICE:

Initial: CH3COO^- = 0.02 M; OH^- = 0

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small).

So Kb ≈ x² /0.02 → x² = Kb *0.02 → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11)= 1.04e-5 M.

pOH =-log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)= -5 +0.017= -4.983 → pOH=4.983. So pH=14-4.983=9.017.

Hmm, same result. So the pH at equivalence is around 9.02, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, looking back: the initial solution after dilution was 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when titrating, the volume changes.

Wait, wait. When you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ of diluted acetic acid, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L =0.02 M. That's correct.

But perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recheck: Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5).

Let me compute that exactly. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.

1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.54054 *1e-9=5.4054e-10. So that's correct.

So pKb is log(5.4054e-10)= log(5.4054) + log(1e-10)=0.7327 -10= -9.2673 → wait, no. Wait, wait. pKb is -log(Kb), which is -log(5.4054e-10) → approximately 9.268.

Wait, because 1e-10 has a log of -10, and 5.4054 is 5.4054e-10 → log is log(5.4054) + log(1e-10)= 0.7327 -10= -9.2673 → so pKb is 9.2673.

So pOH =9.2673 → pH=14-9.2673=4.7327. Wait, no! That can't be right because that gives an acidic pH, which contradicts the fact that acetate is a base. Wait, what's wrong here.

Wait, no. Because Kb is 5.405e-10, which is a very small number, so pKb is 9.268. So pOH is 9.268, so pH=14-9.268=4.732. But that's acidic, which can't be correct.

Wait, no, no. Because if Kb is small, the base isn't strong. So the solution is only slightly basic. Wait, but 4.732 is less than 7, which is acidic. That can't be right because acetate is a base. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. I think I got pKb and pOH wrong. Let me recalculate.

Kb =5.405e-10 → pKb= log(1/(5.405e-10)) → no, pKb is -log(Kb).

So pKb= -log(5.405e-10) → 5e-10 is 1e-9/2, so pKb is about 9.268.

Wait, so pKb=9.268 → pOH =9.268 → pH=14-9.268=4.732. But that can't be right because if the solution is of a base, pH should be higher than 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, like sodium acetate, the solution should be basic. So why am I getting pH=4.732, which is acidic?

Ah! Wait a minute. I think I confused Kb and Ka in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the Ka of acetic acid to find the pH of the equivalence point solution.

Wait, no. Because the solution at equivalence point is the conjugate base (acetate), which uses Kb.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered the hydrolysis of acetate in a different way. Let me try using the exact expression.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

We can let x be the [OH^-] produced. So:

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 -x) → but since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb *0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11)= 1.04e-5.

[OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.977 → pH=9.023.

Hmm, that's the same as before. But why is this not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is incorrect. The problem says we mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration is (0.05 M *0.02 L ) / 0.04 L =0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M *0.01 L=0.001 mol. So moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³=0.05 L → 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

So the calculation seems correct, but the pH of ~9.02 isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding. Let me read the question again.

The question is: when you titrate the resulting solution (after dilution) with 0.1 M NaOH. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.

At equivalence point, the pH is around 9.02, which isn't in any of the options. So perhaps the options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the equivalence point. But at equivalence, [A-] is much higher than [HA], but all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so [HA] is zero. No, that's not correct. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate, so [HA] is zero. So the solution is only acetate and its conjugate acid (from water). Wait, but that's not a buffer anymore; it's a solution of a weak base.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a weak base solution.

The formula is:

pH = ½ (pKb - log C)

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C)

But that's the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the Kb, but I should use the Ka in a different way. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate. Let me double-check the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added at equivalence: 0.1 M *0.01 L=0.001 mol. So moles of acetate formed:0.001 mol. Volume=50 cm³=0.05 L → 0.001 / 0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The options don't include 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution calculation is incorrect. Wait, when you mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, correct. So 0.05 M * (20/40) =0.025 M.

At equivalence point, the volume is 50 cm³, so concentration is 0.02 M acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH correctly using the exact expression.

Let me write Kb =5.405e-10. [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M.

So:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, [CH3COOH] =x, [OH^-]=x, [CH3COO^-]=0.02.

So Kb = (x^2)/0.02 → x= sqrt(0.02*Kb)= sqrt(0.02*5.405e-10)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.977 → pH=9.023.

Hmm. So none of the options match. But looking at the options, option D has 6.92 as equivalence pH, which is wrong. Option A has 8.52, which is closer but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the diluted solution isn't 0.025 M, but I'm not seeing where I could have gone wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the equivalence point, but that's not applicable because all the acid is neutralized. Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence point is when pH=pKa, but that's only true for strong acid-strong base titrations, which isn't this case.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the pH of the equivalence point because the solution is a weak base, so the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate. Maybe I can find an option that has a pH around 9, but none of the options do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact equation without approximation.

The expression is Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x²=0.02 *5.405e-10 → x=1.04e-5, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not make that assumption. Let me solve the equation without approximation.

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x= [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 → approx 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → approx 4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

We take the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6 M.

Wait, that's a bigger x than before. So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.487 → pH=8.513.

Ah! Now that's close to option A's equivalence point of 8.52.

Wait, so why did the approximation give a different result? Because the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 may not hold here. Let me check.

If x=3.288e-6, then 0.02 -x=0.01996712, which is only a 0.003% change. So the approximation would be valid, but in this case, the exact solution gives a larger x, leading to a higher pH.

Hmm, this seems conflicting. Let me compute with and without the approximation.

Without approximation:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x= [ -5.405e-10 + sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11) ) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 =2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

Discriminant=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11= ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 )/2 → approx (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.487 → pH=8.513.

That's about 8.51, which matches option A's equivalence point of 8.52.

So perhaps I should use the exact solution instead of the approximation, which changes the result significantly.

Wait, but why did the approximation give a different result? Because when the concentration is low and Kb is small, the approximation holds. But perhaps in this case, the x is not negligible, so the approximation is not valid. Wait, but earlier approximation gave x=1.04e-5, which is smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. But the exact solution gives a higher x, leading to higher pH.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me reevaluate.

If I use x=3.288e-6, then [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH=5.487 → pH=8.513, which is around 8.51.

Which matches option A's equivalence point of 8.52.

So perhaps the correct pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but why was my initial calculation with the approximation giving a different result? Because perhaps the assumption that x is negligible isn't valid here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the Kb and Ka somewhere. Let me check again.

Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. So using the exact solution, x is 3.288e-6, leading to pH around 8.51.

So that would make option A have the equivalence point at 8.52, which would be correct.

So putting it all together: at 25% titration, pH≈4.26; at equivalence point, pH≈8.51.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that matches.

But earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH=9.02, which is higher than 8.51. So perhaps I should use the exact method.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Dilution of acetic acid**:  
  The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L), and its concentration is 0.05 M. After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L).  
  The new concentration of acetic acid is:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{New volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume of NaOH has been added.  
- **Equivalence point volume**:  
  The moles of acetic acid initially are:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]  
  Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid, the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:  
  \[
  V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
  \]  
  At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is:  
  \[
  V_{\text{NaOH, 25\%}} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
  \]  
  The moles of NaOH added are:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]  
  Since NaOH neutralizes acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]  
  The moles of acetate ion formed are:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]  
  The total volume of the solution is:  
  \[
  V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]  
  The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:  
  \[
  [\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
  \]  
  Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
  \]  
  where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
  \]  
  Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.25**.

---

### **Step 3: Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ion in a total volume of:  
\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of acetate is:  
\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]  
The \(K_b\) for acetate is:  
\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]  
Using the approximation for weak bases:  
\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{Acetate}]} \implies [OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{Acetate}]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([OH^-]) = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]  
However, solving the quadratic equation without approximation gives a slightly higher pH of approximately **8.52**, which matches the closest option.

### **Final Answer**
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**.
