Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, there are two reactions given, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

Let me break this down reaction by reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of cyanide ions (CN-), which are nucleophiles. So this looks like a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, but wait. When a cyanide ion adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN, right? So that's exactly what's happening here. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin.

But what's the role of reagent A here? For the addition of CN- to a ketone, I think the reaction typically requires an acid catalyst, like H+ ions. Because the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic. So the ketone is protonated, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So reagent A must be an acid. Looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+ (which is typically HCl, H2SO4, etc.) or NaHSO3. Wait, but H3O+ is a source of protons, so it could be an acid like HCl or H2SO4, but in the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, but sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is also an acid. It's a source of H+ and bisulfite ions. So in the first reaction, do we need an acid catalyst? Yes. So H3O+ (like from HCl) or NaHSO3 could both be possible. But which one is correct?

Wait, maybe it's about the strength of the acid. For the formation of cyanohydrin, I think the reaction is usually done in an acidic condition. But sometimes, it can also be done with other acids. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the addition reaction can proceed without a strong acid. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the second reaction first and see if it gives any clues.

The second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B and water to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the product is a carboxylic acid. The starting material has a nitrile group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH).

Wait, how does a nitrile group transform into a carboxylic acid? Oh, right, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The standard hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as with H2SO4 and heat, or using HCl as a catalyst.

Wait, but the reaction here uses reagent B and water. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So the conditions for this hydrolysis must be strong acidic. For example, using HCl (H+ from HCl) and water, and heat perhaps. So reagent B is likely a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. But looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, in the options, option A and B have B as HCl and CH3COOH respectively. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. Hmm, can the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids be done with weak acids? I'm not sure. I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid and heat. So maybe B is HCl.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the starting material has both a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. So when B is added, which is in water, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Let me think about the mechanism. Nitriles hydrolyze to amides first, which then go to acids. But under strong acidic conditions, perhaps it goes directly to carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps B is HCl. So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, that would imply option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A) A= H3O+ , B= HCl
B) A= H3O+, B= CH3COOH
C) A= NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A= NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH

So if for the second reaction B is HCl, then options A and C are possibilities. If B is HCl, then those are candidates.

But wait, the first reaction requires an acid catalyst. So in reagent A, if the acid is H3O+ (like from HCl), then that would be option A. Alternatively, if reagent A is NaHSO3, then H+ is provided by that.

So for the first reaction, the cyanohydrin formation requires acid. So A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. But wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, but could NaHSO3 act as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the catalyst (which would be provided by HCl, for example), and the second reaction uses HCl (so B is HCl).

So looking at options, if A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that's option A.

But wait, another possibility: for the cyanohydrin formation, sometimes a weaker acid might be used. I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps reagent A is NaHSO3, which is a mild acid. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient for the reaction. I think in the cyanohydrin formation, a strong acid is typically used, like HCl, but sometimes, other acids can also work. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the second reaction again. The product is a carboxylic acid, from a nitrile. So the conditions must be acidic. H2O and HCl would provide the necessary acidic environment for hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe it's in the presence of H3O+ (like from HCl) as the catalyst.

So if reagent B is HCl, then options A and C are possible.

Wait, what about for the first reaction. If A is H3O+, which is a strong acid, then that's compatible with the cyanohydrin formation. So option A would have A as H3O+ (like HCl), and B as HCl. But wait, that would mean both A and B are HCl. But looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+ and B=HCl. But H3O+ is the same as H+ in solution, which comes from strong acids like HCl.

Wait, but wait. If you add HCl to butan-2-one and NaCN, would that provide the necessary H+? Yes, because HCl is a strong acid, providing H+ ions. So the first reaction uses HCl as the acid catalyst (so A is HCl? Or is it H3O+?)

Wait, the options list A as H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is the hydrated form of H+, so if A is H3O+, then perhaps it's from HCl or another strong acid. So in the first reaction, the reagent A would be H3O+ (which is the same as H+ in solution) provided by HCl. So A would be H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. That would require both A and B to be HCl, but I don't think that's possible unless H3O+ is part of the same solution. Alternatively, maybe H3O+ is just the acid, and B is HCl for the second reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid. Because HSO3^- is a weaker acid compared to H3O+ (which is very strong). But I'm not sure if that would work for the cyanohydrin formation. Maybe weaker acids can also work, but perhaps the reaction would require stronger conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reagent is H3O+ and the second is HCl, making option A correct. But let me think again about the hydrolysis in the second reaction.

In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is HCl or acetic acid. Reaction conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid—usually, you need strong acid and heat. Because the reaction is typically done in H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) with heat, or using HCl with H2O and heat. So, if the reagent B is HCl (a strong acid), that makes sense. So B must be HCl. So looking at options, that would mean only options A and C are possible for B=HCl.

Now, for A, the first reaction: if A is H3O+, which comes from HCl, then option A is possible. If A is NaHSO3, that would mean option C. But I'm not sure which acid is used in the first reaction.

Wait, another approach: think about what NaHSO3 does. Sodium bisulfite is a source of H+ and bisulfite ions. But in the presence of a ketone and cyanide, would NaHSO3 provide enough H+? I think the cyanide would react with the H+ to form HCN, which is a weak acid. Wait, but that might not be favorable. Alternatively, perhaps the H+ is necessary to protonate the carbonyl group to make it more electrophilic.

Alternatively, maybe in the first reaction, the role of A is to provide H+ so the ketone can react with CN- from NaCN. So if A is H3O+ (from HCl), then the reaction proceeds. So option A would have A as H3O+, and B as HCl.

But looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. So which is correct?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the role of each reagent. In the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

So, butanone is the ketone, NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile. The reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the addition of a nitrile to a ketone is done under specific conditions. For example, using HCN with a catalyst. But in this case, NaCN is present, which is a source of CN- ions. So the reaction is probably in a solution where HCN is formed (from CN- and H+), but more importantly, the CN- is the nucleophile.

So the acid (A) is needed to generate H+ which protonates the carbonyl oxygen. So A must supply H+.

Looking at the options, either A is H3O+ (strong acid) or NaHSO3 (which is a weaker acid, because HSO3^- can donate a proton, but it's a weaker acid than H3O+).

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is a simple addition of CN- and OH- to the carbonyl group.

If the reaction uses a strong acid, like HCl (so A is H3O+), then the reaction would proceed. Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, would it provide enough H+ for the reaction? I'm not sure. Maybe it's possible, but I'm more confident that a stronger acid is used for this type of reaction.

So, if A is H3O+, which is provided by a strong acid like HCl, then the first reaction is correct. So option A would have A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would imply that in the first reaction, HCl is used as the acid, and in the second reaction, HCl is also used as the acid.

Alternatively, I should check the second reaction again. If B is HCl, then the reaction is in HCl and water. So that's a possible scenario.

Alternatively, let's think about the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical reagent is HCl with heat, perhaps in a reflux setup. So that would make sense for the second reaction.

So putting it all together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (A) and the second uses HCl (B). So the correct option would be A where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that's a possibility.

But another thought: sometimes, the first reaction is done under basic conditions, but I don't think so because NaCN in basic conditions might not donate CN- as effectively. Because in basic conditions, CN- would be a weaker nucleophile, perhaps. Wait, no—actually, in basic conditions, the CN- would be deprotonated, which is good because it's a stronger nucleophile. Hmm.

Wait, but the first reaction's reagent is NaCN, which is a salt that provides CN- ions. If the solution is neutral or basic, CN- would be present as CN- (since NaCN is a salt of a weak acid, so it's basic). But the ketone addition requires an acidic environment to protonate the carbonyl.

So in the first reaction, the solution must be acidic to allow the ketone to react. So reagent A must be an acid. So, H3O+ (option A) or NaHSO3 (option C).

But which acid is more suitable? I think that in the presence of CN-, using a strong acid like HCl (which provides H3O+) would be appropriate because the CN- would act as a nucleophile in an acidic solution. So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using NaHSO3 as the acid (option C). But I'm not as confident about that. Wait, but NaHSO3 is a milder acid. Maybe in the presence of NaCN, a stronger acid would protonate the carbonyl better.

Wait, but the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That suggests that the CN- added to the carbonyl, and the OH- came from water (or the solvent). So, the acid is necessary to generate the H+ for the carbonyl's protonation.

Given all that, I think option A is correct: A is H3O+ (so from HCl), and B is HCl. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but let me quickly check the options again. Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. So that's the one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two reactions and determine the suitable reagents for each.

### Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, where a cyanide ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl group of the ketone (butan-2-one). For this reaction to proceed, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻.  

- **Reagent A** must provide H⁺ ions to facilitate the reaction.  
- Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) or **NaHSO₃** (a weaker acid) are possible candidates.  
- H₃O⁺ is a stronger acid and is commonly used in such reactions, making it the most suitable choice for A.

### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For this transformation, strong acidic conditions are typically required.  

- **Reagent B** must provide a strong acid environment.  
- Among the options, **HCl** is a strong acid and is commonly used for such hydrolysis reactions.  
- **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is less suitable for this reaction.

### Conclusion  
From the analysis:  
- For Reaction 1, **A = H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is suitable.  
- For Reaction 2, **B = HCl** (a strong acid) is suitable.  

The correct option is **A**, where **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**.
