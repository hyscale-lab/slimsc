Okay, so I've got this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but let's try to think it through.

First, I should remember what C3h symmetry means. I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry involving a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same when rotated 120 degrees around a certain axis, and also when reflected across a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

The options given are four different molecules. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. The name also includes a trifuran, which is a tricyclic compound with three furan rings. The numbering might imply how the substituents are arranged.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo suggests a benzene ring fused to something. The trifuran part again, and the hexaone indicates ketone groups.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a boron atom with three oxygen-containing groups. Triisopropyl would mean three isopropyl groups attached to boron. So the structure is something like (i-Pr)3BO, I think. The molecule would have three identical substituents around the boron. So what's the symmetry here? If all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, perhaps trigonal symmetry. That might be a candidate for C3h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, right? It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative, a bridge structure. I think it has a certain symmetry, but what kind? I remember it has a center of inversion, so perhaps it's centrosymmetric. But does it have C3h symmetry? Not sure.

So, let's think about each option's symmetry.

Starting with Option C: triisopropyl borate. Boron is in the center with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a -CH(CH3)2 group. Since all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have a trigonal planar arrangement. The symmetry would include a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and a horizontal mirror plane (since each substituent is identical and the structure is flat). So that would fit C3h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. It's a bridge structure with three bridges. The molecule has a three-fold axis, I think. Wait, quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It's a symmetric structure, but I'm not sure about the exact symmetry elements. It has a center of inversion, but I don't think it has a horizontal mirror plane. Because when you look at it, the structure is symmetric in a way that each bridge is equivalent, but maybe it doesn't have a plane that reflects across a horizontal axis. Alternatively, maybe it does. Hmm, I'm not too sure. I'll need to think more.

Option B: The benzo-fused trifuran. Let me visualize this structure. Benzo would be a benzene ring fused to the trifuran. The way the substituents are attached might influence the symmetry. If the benzo groups are arranged in a symmetric way, perhaps with three substituents at 120-degree intervals, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that disrupt the symmetry, then maybe it doesn't have C3h.

Option A: Triphenyleno trifuran. That suggests a larger structure with three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. So if the phenyl groups are symmetrically placed, perhaps at 120-degree rotations, then the molecule might have C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure. It depends on the exact arrangement.

Wait, let's think about each molecule's symmetry again.

Triisopropyl borate: Each substituent is the same, arranged symmetrically around the central boron. So, it's trigonal planar. That would mean a three-fold rotation (C3) and, since the molecule is flat, a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure has high symmetry. It has a three-fold rotation axis because it's symmetric with three bridges. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm trying to imagine looking at it from the top. Since all the bridges are identical and arranged symmetrically, perhaps yes. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't because the molecule is three-dimensional and the mirror plane might not align correctly. Wait, no, for C3h, the horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So if the three-fold axis is vertical (like in a trigonal planar molecule), then the mirror plane would be horizontal. But quinuclidine is more of a three-dimensional structure, so perhaps the mirror plane isn't present. Or maybe it does. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: it's a bicyclo with three bridges, each bridge of two carbons. So the molecule is symmetric across three axes. So it's actually a trigonal symmetry, perhaps with a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it has a center of inversion, making it centrosymmetric, but that's a different symmetry type.

So, if triisopropyl borate has a clear C3h symmetry, then it's a candidate. Option C is triisopropyl borate.

But looking back at the options, options A and B are more complex, so maybe they have higher symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, also, triphenyleno compound (option A) has three phenyl groups attached. If they're arranged symmetrically around the central structure, perhaps the molecule would have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that don't allow such symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D) is a molecule with a three-fold axis, but I'm not sure if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Another thought: quinuclidine is a non-planar molecule. So the horizontal mirror plane would have to reflect across a plane that's perpendicular to the axis of rotation. If the molecule is symmetric when reflected in that plane, then it has C3h.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option in terms of their common structures.

Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. So it definitely has C3h symmetry because it's flat, and all three substituents are the same. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same, and any horizontal mirror plane would leave it unchanged.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a planar molecule? No, quinuclidine is a bicyclic, bridge structure. Wait, no, it's non-planar. So for it to have a horizontal mirror plane, the plane would have to be perpendicular to the molecule's axis. But I'm not sure quinuclidine's structure allows that. Alternatively, perhaps it does, but I'm not certain.

The other options, Benzo[...]trifuran (option B) and Triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) have more complex structures. Maybe if the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, but without seeing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

So, given that, triisopropyl borate (option C) is definitely a strong candidate for having C3h symmetry.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is labeled as triisopropyl borate, which is (i-Pr)3BO. So the structure would have three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. So yes, that's trigonal planar, so it's C3v symmetry? Wait, no, C3h is different from C3v, right.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Let me recall: The point groups. C3h is a symmetry group that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and inversion (i) if present. Alternatively, C3h has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So for a trigonal planar molecule, with a mirror plane, it would be D3h, which is a higher symmetry group. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, for a trigonal planar molecule, the point group is D3h if there are mirror planes, but maybe sometimes it's just C3v if there is a single mirror plane. Wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Point groups:

- C3: a three-fold rotation axis, but no mirror planes or other axes.

- C3v: C3 plus a vertical mirror plane. Wait, no, actually, no. The 'v' in Cnv denotes a vertical mirror plane. So if you have a three-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane, that's C3v.

- C3h: C3 plus a horizontal mirror plane. So for a trigonal planar molecule, with a horizontal mirror plane, that would be C3h.

But wait, in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are all vertical, I think. Because the horizontal mirror plane would just be the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about water molecule. Water is in C2v, but that's a different case.

Alternatively, consider benzene. Benzene is D6h, but that's a higher symmetry.

So, back to triisopropyl borate: it's a flat molecule with three identical substituents. So, each substituent is at 120 degrees from each other. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a mirror plane?

Yes, because if you imagine a horizontal plane (perpendicular to the rotation axis), the molecule would be symmetric. Wait, no, the horizontal plane in this context would be the plane that slices through the boron atom and the midpoints of the substituents. But wait, in a trigonal planar molecule, you don't have a horizontal mirror plane in the same way as, say, a molecule with a vertical mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about a simple trigonal planar molecule, like BF3. BF3 has three identical substituents, so it's trigonal planar. Its symmetry group is D3h, which includes C3, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So if that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would also have D3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has C3h, that's a different point group.

Wait, perhaps I should check the point groups more carefully.

Point group C3h: This group has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and the combination of the two gives another two-fold rotation axis (i.e., inversion). So the group includes the elements {E, C3, C3^2, σh, σh C3, σh C3^2}.

Now, for a molecule with C3h symmetry, it would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would look the same when rotated 120 degrees and also when reflected across a horizontal plane.

But wait, BF3 has D3h symmetry, which includes all the elements of C3h plus additional vertical mirror planes. So BF3 has higher symmetry than C3h.

So, if the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other symmetry elements, it would be in C3h. But if it has multiple mirror planes, it would be in a different group.

So, triisopropyl borate: The molecule is (i-Pr)3BO. It has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically. So it's trigonal planar. So, like BF3, it would have multiple mirror planes. So the point group would be D3h, not C3h.

Hmm, so maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h, but D3h.

Then, which of the options actually has C3h symmetry?

Wait, perhaps one of the others.

Let me go back to the options.

Option D is quinuclidine. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a norbornane derivative. The molecule is symmetric but in a three-dimensional way. I think it has a three-fold rotation axis but not a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, perhaps it does.

Alternatively, maybe the structure allows for a horizontal mirror plane. If you imagine looking along the three-fold axis, the structure is symmetric on both ends. So perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is D3h.

Quinuclidine (option D) has a different symmetry. I think quinuclidine is in the D3h point group as well because of its symmetry elements. Or maybe it's in a lower symmetry group.

Wait, no, quinuclidine is a three-dimensional molecule. Its structure is symmetric but I'm not sure about the mirror planes. I think it has a center of inversion but perhaps not a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h. If it doesn't have the mirror plane, maybe it's just C3.

So, maybe none of the options have C3h, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating triisopropyl borate.

Wait, another thought: maybe triisopropyl borate is a non-planar molecule. No, wait, the boron is sp2 hybridized, so it's trigonal planar. So the molecule is flat, so a horizontal mirror plane would be present. Wait, but earlier I thought it was D3h.

Wait, let me think about the possible point groups. If a molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and at least one horizontal mirror plane, it's in C3h. But if it also has vertical mirror planes, it's in D3h.

So, if triisopropyl borate has vertical mirror planes, then it's D3h, not C3h. So it wouldn't be the answer.

Which of the other options have only a horizontal mirror plane? Or maybe none of them, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps option A or B.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Hmm, the benzo rings are fused to the trifuran, which is a three-ring structure. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that allow 120-degree rotation and a mirror plane.

Similarly, option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran.

Triphenylene would have three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. So maybe this molecule has C3h symmetry.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to tell.

Another approach: I'll recall that triphenylene derivatives can sometimes have C3h symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric fashion. But the compound in option A is a triphenyleno-trifuran, which might have a central structure where the triphenylene is attached to a trifuran.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tough.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, because it's a known trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry. But the question is about C3h, not D3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, the question states which molecule has C3h symmetry. I think the correct answer is quinuclidine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options have C3h, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must be non-planar because a mirror plane in a planar molecule would be vertical, not horizontal.

Wait, no. Because a horizontal mirror plane in a planar molecule would be the plane of the molecule itself. Wait, no, in a trigonal planar molecule, the plane of the molecule is the same as the horizontal mirror plane. So, for a trigonal planar molecule, the point group would have a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h or D3h.

Wait, but in that case, the mirror plane is in the same plane as the molecule. So, triisopropyl borate would have a horizontal mirror plane, which slices through the boron. So, the mirror plane would invert the substituents above and below the plane. But in a trigonal planar molecule, the substituents are all in the same plane, so the mirror plane would pass through the boron and the midpoints between substituents. So, for each substituent, it would be mirrored to the position directly opposite, but since all substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule would look the same. So, this would satisfy the C3h symmetry.

Wait, but again, if the molecule has vertical mirror planes as well, then it's D3h.

So, perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, not C3h. That would mean it's not the correct answer.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps I should think about each option's structure and see which one has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure: planar, three identical substituents. So, yes to C3. Mirror plane: yes, because the molecule is symmetric when reflected across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (horizontal mirror plane). So, C3h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I thought it had D3h. Maybe I was wrong.

Wait, D3h has more symmetry elements. It includes C3, σh, and other vertical mirror planes.

Wait, no. The D3h group includes a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and three vertical mirror planes. So, if a molecule has all these, it's D3h.

So, triisopropyl borate, which is flat, has all these symmetry elements, so it's D3h. Therefore, it doesn't have C3h symmetry.

So, perhaps none of the options have C3h symmetry. But that can't be the case because the question is expecting one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran.

In that structure, the triphenylene part has three phenyl groups connected in a symmetric way. Suppose the trifuran is at the center, and the three phenyl groups are attached at 120-degree intervals. Then the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane. So, that's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps option B: benzo[...]trifuran. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same, and also reflects across a horizontal plane.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of symmetry elements each option has.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It's planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane. It also has three vertical mirror planes. So, it's D3h, not C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a bridged bicyclic molecule. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the structure is symmetric when reflected across a plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then yes.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: the molecule is made of three bridges, each of two carbons. So, when looking along the three-fold axis (which goes through the center of the molecule), the structure appears symmetric. So, reflecting across a horizontal plane (perpendicular to this axis) would leave the molecule unchanged. So, it would have a horizontal mirror plane.

So, quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, that would make option D the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely sure, but given the reasoning, that's where I'm leaning.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the axis. If the three-fold rotation axis is vertical, then the horizontal mirror plane would be in the same plane as the base of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine's structure is such that it's not symmetric across a horizontal plane. Let me try to visualize it.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure is three bridges, each with two carbons. So, the molecule is symmetric in a way that each bridge is equivalent. If I look at the molecule from above, it would look like a triangular prism. So, perhaps a horizontal mirror plane would split the molecule into two mirror images.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric enough to have a horizontal mirror plane.

In that case, quinuclidine (option D) would have C3h symmetry.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Below is the detailed analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. If the phenyl groups are arranged at 120° intervals around the central structure, the molecule could have a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is uncertain without the exact structure. While symmetry is possible, there is insufficient evidence to confirm **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzo-fused trifuran structure. The arrangement of the substituents and the fused rings may allow for a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is unclear due to the complexity of the fused system. Without further structural details, **C₃h** symmetry cannot be confirmed.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, forming a trigonal planar geometry. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), it also has multiple vertical mirror planes, making its symmetry group **D₃h**, not **C₃h**. Therefore, it does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a three-dimensional structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and is symmetric when reflected across a horizontal plane (σₕ), which is perpendicular to the three-fold axis. This combination of symmetry elements satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry group.

---

### **Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, **quinuclidine** (Option D) is the molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry due to its three-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: D**
