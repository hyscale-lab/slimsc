Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and fluorescent markers. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of the genetic engineering concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the vector has two coding regions under a single promoter.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position and fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Oh, and there are some stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. I think loxP sites are used for recombination with Cre. Oh right, if Cre is expressed, it can excise certain regions.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The upstream part of the receptor has an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so maybe that's for separate translation?

So the vector is probably set up so that without Cre, both the ligand and receptor have stop cassettes. But when Cre is present, it would excise the stops, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. Actin loading is a control, which they say is fine. But the real issue is when they breed mice homozygous for the construct and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice. They're looking for GFP under the microscope but don't see it.

Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, I think. So in those cells, the Cre would recombine the lox sites, right? So the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is excised) along with mCherry, and the receptor would be expressed with eGFP.

But the result is no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the construct is in the same cell, maybe autocrine? But the question is about the expression of the proteins, not their function. So maybe this isn't the issue here. Because the problem is about expression, not signaling.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But why would that happen? Unless the construct is faulty. But the question is about expression from the vector. Also, without Cre, the ORF wouldn't be expressed. So perhaps this isn't the main issue because in the presence of Cre, the construct should be active.

Option C: Enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the promoters might not be active. The ligand is under CBA promoter which is strong, but if the enhancer is missing, maybe the regions aren't being expressed. But the CBA promoter is constitutive, right? So I'm not sure. Wait, the vector uses CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. So if there's no enhancer, perhaps the ligand is expressed but the receptor isn't. But the mouse was bred in the wildtype background, so maybe the promoters are sufficient.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, I see. If the receptor's ORF is fused to eGFP but not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would be expressed as a separate protein, but maybe not correctly. Wait, no. If they're in the same frame, the eGFP would be appended after the receptor. If not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, because the stop codon would terminate early.

Wait, the vector is set up such that the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the fusion is in the same frame, then the receptor-eGFP would be a single protein. But if the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be expressed because the stop codon would come before.

But in the question, the construct is designed so that the ligand is at 5', with a stop, then the IRES, then the receptor. Wait, the setup: the vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in one mRNA. The first ORF is ligand, followed by mCherry, but with a stop in a loxP cassette. Then the second ORF is the receptor with eGFP, with a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, bicistronic vectors use IRES elements to allow both ORFs to be translated. The first ORF is ligand, perhaps using a Kozak sequence or something. But without Cre, the stops are in place. When Cre is present, the stops are excised.

But in the mouse, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stops, allowing expression of ligand and receptor.

In the ligand's case, it's fused to mCherry. So the ligand is expressed, and the mCherry as well. The receptor is fused to eGFP. So when Cre is active, both the ligand and receptor are expressed.

But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Did they see any bands? The question doesn't say, but the main issue is the lack of GFP in the offspring.

Wait, the problem says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and did a Western blot. So perhaps in the in vitro setup, they saw expression. But in the in vivo case, when using the mouse model, they don't see GFP.

But why? Let me think about the construct again. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre construct. So, when Cre is present, it should excise the stops, allowing both ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, another thing: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. Then, after that, the IRES, and then the receptor ORF with its own stop in a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the structure. Maybe the vector is designed so that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES, which is controlled by the same promoter. So both are expressed as a single transcript, but translation starts at the ligand's start codon, and then the IRES allows the ribosome to switch to the receptor ORF.

But without Cre, the stops would prevent expression. So when Cre is present, the stops are cut out, so the ligand and receptor are expressed.

But in the mouse model, when they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine in the cells where SOX10 is active, which are neural crest cells.

So in these cells, the stops are excised, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed. The ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But in the confocal, they don't see green. So why is that? Maybe the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the receptor is translated, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. But wait, the eGFP is supposed to be a fusion at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the ORF is not in the same frame, the eGFP wouldn't be made, or perhaps a truncated version that doesn't fluoresce.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed such that when Cre excises the stop, the ORF of the receptor and eGFP are in a single frame. But if that's not the case, the eGFP might not be readable.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is at 5' with a stop, then the IRES, and then the receptor with a stop. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed, so the transcript is ligand ORF, then IRES, then receptor ORF. So it's a single transcript.

Wait, but the IRES allows for internal initiation, so the receptor can be translated from the same mRNA. But if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, their fusion might not be correct. However, the question is why eGFP isn't present.

Another thought: perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation. Because loxP and lox2272 are different sites for Cre recombination. If the construct isn't properly recombined, the stops might not be excised. But in the scenario, they used SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active.

Wait, but the vector might be designed such that the Cre is under a tissue-specific promoter, but in this case, the vector uses the host's Cre, which comes from the SOX10-Cre mice.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is under a stop cassette that isn't being excised, so the receptor is expressed but eGFP isn't. But wait, the question states that the stop is in a lox2272 cassette for the receptor-eGFP. So Cre would excise that as well. So after Cre, the eGFP should be expressed.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being translated. If the frame is wrong, then the eGFP's start codon isn't in frame, so it's not translated. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, no, the eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed. So the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP would not.

So in the mouse model, you'd see the receptor protein via Western blot, but not eGFP. So when they look under the confocal, there's no green (eGFP) signal.

So the correct answer would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame.

But let me think again. If the eGFP is out of frame, then the fusion protein might not be made correctly. So the eGFP might not be expressed. Alternatively, the eGFP might have a premature stop codon, leading to no eGFP expression.

So in the Western blot, the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (like the receptor) would detect the receptor, but not eGFP, because it's not expressed. But the question says that in the Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin. So perhaps the eGFP wasn't detected, but the receptor was. But the main issue is that in the offspring, there's no green, meaning eGFP isn't being expressed.

So why isn't eGFP being expressed? Because it's not in the same frame as the receptor. So the construct for the receptor-eGFP is not in frame, so when the receptor is translated, the eGFP isn't, leading to no fluorescence.

So the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites are present between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. SOX10-Cre mice were used to drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A (Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship):**  
  This option pertains to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor, not their expression. The question focuses on the lack of eGFP fluorescence, which is unrelated to whether the ligand and receptor act in a paracrine manner. This option does not explain the observed result.

- **Option B (The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi):**  
  If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would fail to reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, the issue lies in the expression of eGFP itself, not its trafficking. The question does not provide evidence of improper trafficking, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C (The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing):**  
  The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under an IRES element, which allows for internal ribosome entry. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing or insufficient, and the construct is designed to function without additional enhancers. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

- **Option D (The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame):**  
  If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be translated as a fusion protein. This would result in the receptor being expressed but eGFP not being produced, leading to the absence of fluorescence. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of green signal and is the most likely reason for the result.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP fluorescence is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame, preventing the expression of eGFP. This makes **Option D** the correct answer.

**Answer: D**
