Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me draw the structure of the target compound. So, benzene ring with substituents. The positions are numbered 1, 2, 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, wait, I need to make sure the numbering is correct. Oh wait, in the IUPAC name, the substituents are numbered such that the highest priority groups get the lowest numbers. The priority order is nitro (NO2) is higher than ethoxy (OEt) and t-butyl is lower than both, I think. Wait, substituents have priority based on functional groups: nitro is higher than ether. So the numbering should start from the nitro group.

Wait, let me think: for benzene derivatives, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, if the nitro is in position 1, then ethoxy in 2, and t-butyl in 3? Or maybe I have that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. Let me imagine the structure: 

Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, each with substituents. So it's meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me see, 1, 2, 3 would be adjacent in a row. So the nitro is at position 1, ethoxy at 2, and t-butyl at 3. Or maybe I should just consider the substituents' positions relative to each other.

Wait, another approach: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So they are adjacent. But wait, benzene is a ring; 1,2,3 positions are adjacent in a way that each substituent is next to the others. So the molecule is a tri-substituted benzene with substituents in adjacent positions.

But wait, perhaps I should focus more on the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene, and the product has three substituents: t-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The steps likely involve Friedel-Crafts alkylation, nitration, etherification, maybe sulfonation, nitroso, etc. But I'm a bit rusty, so let me go through the possible steps one by one.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). So the synthesis will involve three substitution reactions on benzene. But the order of these reactions matters because substituents can direct the next reaction.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is used for adding alkyl groups. Nitration is a meta-directing group, and ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para-directing. But wait, ethoxy is a strong activating group because it's an ether. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups, but ethoxy is an ether substituent, which can be introduced via alkylation, perhaps using Williamson ether synthesis, but that's more for forming ethers from alkoxides and alkyl halides. Alternatively, maybe introducing the ethoxy group via an SN2 reaction or something else.

Wait, but benzene can't undergo SN2. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a benzene ring that's been made activated, like via a leaving group. Wait, but benzene doesn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a alkoxy group substitution, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl bromide and AlCl3 as a catalyst. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation doesn't add ethers; it adds alkyl groups. Oh, wait, no. Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, but to get an ethoxy group, perhaps it's better to use a different method. Oh, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via an O-alkylation, but that's more for alcohols or phenols. Since benzene is an aromatic ring, maybe using a phenol group and then converting it to an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution using an ethylating agent under certain conditions. Wait, but benzene is not reactive enough for that. So I must have a directing group that allows substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires a strongly activating group, like a nitro group. Or wait, nitro is deactivating; maybe a leaving group is present in a position where a nitro group is already present, allowing substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then the t-butyl and nitro groups. Or some other order.

Wait, let me think about the directing effects of each substituent. Let's list the substituents and their directing effects:

- t-Butyl group (alkyl): activating, ortho/para directing.
- Ethoxy group (OEt): activating, ortho/para directing.
- Nitro group (NO2): deactivating, meta directing.

So, when adding substituents, each new group will direct the next substitution based on its position and type.

In the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1 (nitro), 2 (ethoxy), and 3 (t-butyl). Whatever the case, the key is the order of adding substituents.

But to maximize yield, we need to add substituents in an order that allows each reaction to proceed with proper directing.

Let me think about the possible steps. Let's say we start with benzene.

Option 1: Add the ethoxy group first. But how? Because benzene doesn't have an oxygen, so we can't directly substitute. So maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a ring that's been sulfonated. Wait, but that's for making phenols. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a benzene with an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts, then convert it to an ethoxy group. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation would give an alkyl group, and then perhaps oxidizing or something else. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a sulfonation step, but that adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an alkylation using an ethyl halide and AlCl3 as a catalyst. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So maybe I need to form a benzene oxide or something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group has been installed. Wait, but benzene is not easily substituted. So maybe we first introduce a nitro group, which is meta-directing, then another group, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a benzene ring with a leaving group that is replaced by an ethoxy group. But how? For that, perhaps we have a nitration step, followed by some activation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents in the target. The ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, when adding substituents, each new group should be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Let me think about the order of adding substituents. Let's say first, add the t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts (AlCl3 and t-BuCl). Then, add the nitro group. Then, add the ethoxy group. Or another order.

Wait, but the problem is that the ethoxy group is an activating group, so we have to add it before deactivating groups if possible, because otherwise, the ring becomes deactivated and subsequent reactions won't proceed as easily.

Wait, but let me think about the steps involved:

1. Introduce t-butyl group: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So step i would be t-BuCl and AlCl3.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky because it can lead to carbocation rearrangements. But assuming we have t-BuCl, which is a tertiary chloride, it may not rearrange, so that's okay.

So after step i, we have t-butylbenzene.

2. Next, introduce nitro group. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating reaction. So after adding t-butyl, which is ortho/para-directing, the next substitution (nitration) would be directed to the meta position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, the t-butyl is in position 2. So when we nitrate t-butylbenzene, the nitro group would go in position 5 (meta to position 2), but that may not be the case because I'm not sure about the numbering.

Wait, maybe I should sketch the benzene ring. Let me imagine benzene with t-butyl at position 1. Then, the nitration would occur at position 3 (meta), position 4 (para), or position 2 (ortho). But since t-butyl is an activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but wait: the nitration is an electrophilic substitution. The t-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the nitro group would enter either ortho or para to the t-butyl group.

But the target molecule has nitro in a specific position relative to the other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done before adding the ethoxy group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: let's look at the options given and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each one lists a series of steps. Let me try to parse option D.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of benzene. So benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: This is a reduction reaction. Fe/HCl is used in the Gattermann–Koch reaction, but wait, no, Fe/HCl is more likely used in the cleavage of a C-O bond, like in the case of benzene rings with nitro groups. Wait, nitrobenzene with Fe/HCl would undergo reduction? No, Fe/HCl is for the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amino groups. Wait, no, nitro groups are typically reduced to amines with H2/Pd, for example. Wait, Fe/HCl is used for the hydrolysis of nitro groups? Hmm, I think that's more of a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a replacement reaction.

Wait, maybe this step is a nitration followed by some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps step ii is a nitro group being converted into something else. Alternatively, perhaps step ii is a reduction, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think again. If the first step is nitration of benzene to produce nitrobenzene. Then step ii is Fe/HCl, which is a mixture of iron and hydrochloric acid. I think this is used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but under acidic conditions. Wait, but nitrobenzene in Fe/HCl would typically hydrolyze to phenylhydroxylamine, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to sulfonate? No, sulfonation uses H2SO4 and SO3.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe/HCl is for some kind of substitution, but I'm not getting it. Maybe move on.

Option D's next step is iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. So this would be a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. So after nitration, the ring is deactivated, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation wouldn't proceed because it's an electrophilic substitution requiring an activated ring. So step iii in option D would not work because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.

So option D's sequence is i) nitrate benzene, ii) ? not sure, iii) Friedel-Crafts. But that won't work because the nitro group deactivates the ring, making alkylation difficult. So option D is unlikely.

Let me check option B.

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene, giving t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration. Since the ring now has a t-butyl group (activating, ortho/para), the nitration would add nitro groups in the ortho or para positions.

Which position would it go? Let's say the t-butyl is at position 1. Then nitration would occur at 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But the target molecule needs nitro at position 3, which is meta to t-butyl. So perhaps this isn't the right order.

Wait, maybe the nitration adds in a position that's ortho to t-butyl, making it position 2. Then, perhaps another group is added.

Step iii is Fe/HCl. Hmm, not sure again.

Alternatively, perhaps option C.

Option C steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts, giving t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

So now, the ring has t-butyl and a sulfonic acid group. The sulfonic acid is in what position? The t-butyl is in position 1; sulfonic acid would be added in position 3 or 4? Wait, t-butyl is ortho/para directing. So sulfonation would occur at positions 2, 4, or 6 (ortho and para to t-butyl). Wait, but sulfonic acid is a strong deactivator, which would make the ring less reactive for further electrophilic substitutions, but perhaps this is a way to block certain positions.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this helps. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is used as a leaving group in a later step.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is replaced with something else.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there's a nitro group, not a sulfonic acid. So perhaps this is a way to introduce a nitro group in a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the next step is nitration. Let me see.

Option C's step iii is HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

So if the ring has a t-butyl group and a sulfonic acid group, the next substitution would be directed by the strongest director. The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. The t-butyl is activating, ortho/para. So which group has higher priority in directing? The activating groups are stronger directors, I think. So the nitration would be directed by the t-butyl group.

Wait, but if the ring already has a sulfonic acid group, which is meta directing, and a t-butyl group, which is ortho/para, perhaps the nitration goes to a position that's both ortho to t-butyl and meta to the sulfonic acid.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is synthesized by first adding the ethoxy group, then the t-butyl, then the nitro. But I'm not sure how to introduce the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, if we have a nitro group, perhaps it can be converted into a nitroso, which can leave, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. In that case, the ring needs to be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups.

Wait, so maybe the nitro group is present before introducing the ethoxy group. Let's see.

If the nitro group is present first, then adding the ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution.

But how? Maybe after introducing a nitro group, we can install a good leaving group, like a tosylate, which can be substituted by an ethoxide.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the substituents again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, numbering the ring, position 1: OEt, position 2: t-Bu, position 3: NO2.

So, the three substituents are adjacent to each other. Each is in the ortho position relative to the next.

So, considering the order of addition:

Option 1: Nitro group first, then t-butyl, then ethoxy.

But nitro is deactivating, which would make subsequent alkylation difficult.

Option 2: Ethoxy first, but how? Because benzene doesn't have an oxygen. So perhaps introduce a nitro group first, then do a substitution to get the ethoxy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis. But that requires a phenoxide ion, which is generated by deprotonating phenol. So to get phenol, we could sulfonate benzene, then substitute the sulfonic acid group with a hydroxyl.

Wait, but that's a lengthy process. Let me outline it:

1. Benzene → sulfonate (using H2SO4 and SO3) → benzene sulfonic acid.

2. Then, perform a substitution reaction to replace the sulfonic acid group with a hydroxyl group. But how? Maybe using a strong base like KOH under high heat, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

3. Once we have phenol, we can perform a nucleophilic substitution with an ethyl halide to get the ethoxy group. But wait, phenol is a strong activating group, so perhaps Friedel-Crafts alkylation would be more straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, but that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, which is a carbon chain. To get an ethoxy group, I think a different approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a nitro group and a t-butyl group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since t-butyl is ortho/para directing, the nitro group would go ortho or para to it.

Suppose the t-butyl is in position 1, then nitro could be in position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Then step iii is SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group would be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But I'm not sure what comes next in the sequence. Let me look at all the steps.

Option A's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group added.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → this is the diazotization step, used for making diazonium salts. Typically done on aryl amines, but wait, where is the amine coming from? Not sure.

v) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis of a nitro group? Not sure.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → could be a hydrolysis step, perhaps converting a nitro group to an amine or something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, but in benzene rings, perhaps it's a substitution of a leaving group with ethoxide.

viii) Fe/HCl → perhaps a reduction or substitution.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has three substituents: t-Bu, OEt, and NO2. So the steps should add these three groups in the correct order.

Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, because nitration is a strong deactivating step, making further substitution difficult. So the nitro group should be introduced after the other two groups. Or perhaps not, because sometimes you can add groups in a certain order to get the desired orientation.

Wait, the target has the nitro group in position 3. So perhaps if the nitro is added last, then the other groups would be in position 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then the t-Bu, then the nitro. But how to add the ethoxy group?

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution using a good leaving group. But for that, the ring must be activated. Let's say we have a nitro group, which is deactivating, but perhaps a good leaving group is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, but that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group added. Now the ring has t-Bu and SO3H groups.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since SO3H is a strong deactivator and meta-directing, and t-Bu is activating and ortho/para.

Which director is stronger? The activating group is stronger, so the nitration would go ortho or para to the t-Bu.

So if t-Bu is position 1, nitration could be in position 2 or 4.

But the target has nitro in position 3. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Let me think about another option.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added, ortho or para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

This sequence seems complicated.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction to amino.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts on benzene with amino group? But amino is a strong activating group, which would make the ring very reactive. But after nitration and reduction, the ring has an amino group.

But the problem is that Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an amino benzene would direct the alkylation to the ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

Alternatively, after the amino group is present, perhaps adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. Then, perhaps another nitration.

But the target molecule has nitro, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the t-Bu group, then the nitro group, then the ethoxy group via substitution.

But how do you add the ethoxy group once the ring has a nitro group?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must have a strong electron-withdrawing group that activates the position for substitution. So if the ring has a nitro group in a position that directs the substitution, perhaps the ethoxy can be added.

Wait, but nitro is meta directing. So if the nitro is in position 3, perhaps the ethoxy is added in position 1 (directed by another group). But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a good leaving group, such as a nitro group that has been converted into a nitroso, which can leave.

But I'm not exactly sure about that.

Another angle: the options have different sequences. The target molecule's substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So the order of addition should be such that each step directs the next substitution correctly.

Perhaps the best way is to plan the order of addition as follows:

1. Introduce t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts (step i: t-BuCl and AlCl3).

2. Then introduce the nitro group in the meta position relative to t-Bu.

But wait, the t-Bu is ortho/para directing. So nitration would add in ortho or para. So after t-Bu in position 1, nitro could be in position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

But the target has nitro in position 3, which is meta to t-Bu. So that can't happen if the nitro is added after the t-Bu.

Hmm, maybe I need to introduce the nitro group before the t-Bu.

But then, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu) won't proceed. So that's impossible.

Wait, unless I can find a way to activate the ring after nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the t-Bu and ethoxy groups.

Wait, but that would require that the ring has activating groups to direct the nitration correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, but adding ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible because that adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires the ring to be activated with strong EWG, which would be the nitro group. But if the nitro group is already present, perhaps this can be done.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution. But how?

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the ring is activated in the meta position, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that adds an acyl group, which can then be reduced to an ethyl group. But that doesn't directly give an ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from an O-alkylation of a phenol group.

So, maybe:

1. Benzene → nitrobenzene (nitration).

2. Nitrobenzene → phenol (reduction? Not sure. Alternatively, nitro to hydroxyl via some method.)

Wait, maybe nitrobenzene can be converted to phenol via hydrolysis under strong acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, nitrobenzene can be hydrolyzed to phenylhydroxylamine under acidic conditions, but not directly to phenol. Alternatively, perhaps using a catalyst like Fe/HCl.

Wait, I think that nitrobenzene can be converted to phenol via hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions with H2O and heat. So:

Nitrobenzene → H2SO4, H2O, heat → phenol.

Then, phenol can undergo O-alkylation to form the ethoxy group.

So:

3. Phenol → treatment with ethyl bromide and a base (like NaOH) → ethoxyphenol.

But wait, O-alkylation of phenol requires a good base and an alkyl halide. So ethyl bromide and NaOH could give the ethoxy group.

Once the ethoxy group is attached, then we can add the t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, the ring now has an ethoxy group (activating, ortho/para) and the nitro group (deactivating, meta). Which group is more directing?

The ethoxy group is activating, so it would be the stronger director. So the Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu) would add the t-Bu group in the ortho or para positions relative to the ethoxy.

But the target molecule has t-Bu in position 2 and nitro in position 3.

Wait, suppose after adding ethoxy (position 1), then adding t-Bu in position 2 (ortho), and then nitro in position 3 (meta to t-Bu, but wait, that's adjacent to ethoxy). Hmm, but the nitro is a deactivating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro, ethoxy, t-Bu, and then another nitro? Not sure.

This is getting complicated, but perhaps looking at the options again, option B's steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now the ring has t-Bu and nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

I'm not sure. Let me think about each step.

Step i: Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

Step ii: nitration → nitro added ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say nitro in position 2 (ortho).

Now, ring has t-Bu (1) and nitro (2).

Step iii: Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine. So nitro (2) becomes NH2.

Step iv: nitration again → the ring now has t-Bu (1) and NH2 (2). NH2 is a strong activating group, so nitration would go in position 3 (meta to NH2) or 4 (para). But position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu.

Wait, but with NH2 in position 2, the next nitration would be directed to the meta position, which is position 5. But the target has nitro in position 3. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is not a reduction but something else.

This is getting too time-consuming, but perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, let's think about option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

iv) Nitration again → nitro group added.

But after adding t-Bu, which is activating, the next nitration would be directed by it.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the target structure again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2).

So, the order of addition should be such that each substituent is added in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to t-Bu. But t-Bu is ortho/para directing, so nitro would go ortho or para.

Hmm, that doesn't fit the target.

Alternative approach: maybe the nitro group is added first, then the t-Bu, then the ethoxy.

But nitro is deactivating, so after adding nitro, adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts is difficult.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) after installing a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

So steps would be:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Nitrobenzene → substitution with a good leaving group, perhaps converting nitro to a nitroso, which can act as a leaving group.

But I'm not sure about that step.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted to a nitroso, which is a better leaving group. Then, ethoxide can attack in a nucleophilic substitution.

But I'm not familiar with this exact process. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is first added, then the ring is sulfonated, then the sulfonic acid is replaced with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the option where the nitro is added after the t-Bu and ethoxy groups. But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. Since nitro is a meta director, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added meta to the nitro.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the options, perhaps option C is correct.

Option C's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate added, directed by t-Bu.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, directed by t-Bu.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction or substitution.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, this seems too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

But honestly, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: let's think about the nitro group. The nitro group is a meta director. So if the nitro is introduced after the t-Bu group, it would be in the meta position relative to t-Bu. But earlier steps would have to allow that.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the t-Bu at position 1.

So, if the t-Bu is introduced first, then nitration would add nitro in meta (position 3). Then, how to introduce the ethoxy group in position 2 (ortho to t-Bu and adjacent to nitro).

But after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating), making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro is present.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, using a good leaving group that's present after the nitro group is added.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

In the end, considering the options, the correct order would involve adding the t-Bu first (Friedel-Crafts), then nitro (nitration, directed to meta), then ethoxy via substitution.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: looking for the number of steps and the reagents.

The target has three substituents, so the options must include three substitution steps.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → alkylation.

iv) nitrate again → add another nitro.

v) diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

This seems like a lot of steps, but perhaps adding t-Bu after nitration.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another thought: the target has two nitro groups? No, the target has only one nitro group. Oh wait, no. Looking back: the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So only one nitro group.

Hmm. So, the correct sequence must include only one nitration step, unless another nitro group is added and then removed, which seems unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options, option B has two nitration steps (ii and iv). Option C has two nitrations (iii and vi). Option D has two nitrations (i and iv). Option A has two nitrations (ii and ix). So that's four options with two nitrations, but the target has only one nitro group. So perhaps one of the nitration steps is for a different purpose, like introducing a nitro group which is later modified.

Hmm, perhaps in option C, step iii is a nitration, and step vi is a second nitration which is unnecessary, but that may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps include a nitro group which is later reduced or modified.

But this is getting too complicated.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the target structure, the correct order is likely adding t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution. Looking at the options, option B seems to have this order, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3 → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iv) HNO3 → another nitro.

But that would give two nitro groups, which doesn't match the target.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B, but with only one nitration. But the options have multiple steps, so perhaps one nitration is part of a different reaction.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the substituents' positions and the directing effects, I'll conclude that option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The directing effects of the substituents play a critical role in determining the positions of subsequent substitutions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group (ortho/para-directing).
   - Step iii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution, but the sequence does not align with the target structure, as the nitro group would not end up in the correct position.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group (ortho/para-directing).
   - Step iii: Reduction with Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose.
   - Step iv: A second nitration is performed, which would likely introduce an additional nitro group, inconsistent with the target structure that has only one nitro group.
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct substitution pattern.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - Step iii: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group (ortho/para-directing).
   - Subsequent steps involve reduction, diazotization, and substitution, but the sequence does not align with the target structure, as the nitro group would not end up in the correct position.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step ii: Reduction with Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose.
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iv: A second nitration is performed, which would likely introduce an additional nitro group, inconsistent with the target structure that has only one nitro group.
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the reasoning and the complexity of the problem, **Option D** is selected as the most plausible answer, despite its inconsistencies.
