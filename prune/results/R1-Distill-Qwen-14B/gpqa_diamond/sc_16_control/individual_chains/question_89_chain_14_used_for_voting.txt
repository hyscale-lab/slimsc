Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR.

First, I need to figure out what each step produces.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When heated with KOH (a strong base), I think this is an elimination reaction. KOH would likely deprotonate and extract a bromide, leading to the formation of alkenes through an E2 mechanism. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That usually corresponds to a ketone (around 1715), maybe an ester (higher, around 1740). Hmm, but the NMR data: looking at the 1H NMR of product 1. It shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -O- group, like an ether or a carbonyl adjacent. Then 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests some branching or equivalent CH2 groups. 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another set of CH2 groups.

Wait, when dibrominated compounds react with a base, elimination can form alkenes. But if two adjacent bromines are present, elimination would form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form 1,3-diene? But that seems unlikely because the positions are 1 and 3. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a different bridge.

Wait, adamantane has a structure with multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads. Elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads, leading to a more strained structure? But that's not really possible because bridgehead double bonds are not allowed (anti-aromaticity?), so maybe it's not elimination but substitution.

Wait, another possibility is that the base abstracts a proton, leading to a bromide elimination as HBr. So, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but that would require two elimination steps. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is more of a base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Epoxides form when a base like KOH causes two substituents to form an oxygen bridge. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a diepoxy compound? Wait, no, because epoxide formation typically occurs via vicinal dihalide elimination. So a 1,2-dibromo compound would form an epoxide upon treatment with base. But here, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, which isn't vicinal. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group participation. Hmm, perhaps elimination forms an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, forming an allene? But that seems unlikely in such a structure.

Wait, the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How could that happen? Maybe the base induces a dehydrohalogenation followed by a ring opening or rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming two new bonds. Wait, if both Brs are eliminated, each as HBr, but that would require two adjacent Hs, which might not be the case in adamantane. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridge, and elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction results in the formation of a diketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has a singlet at 4.79 ppm. Singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an OCH2O group, like in a diepoxide. Wait, but epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but as a singlet? Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or a ketal. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, like a ketone group. Wait, if it's a ketone, the carbonyl would show up around 2.1 ppm as a singlet. But the singlet in the NMR is at 4.79, which is more like an OCH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring? I don't think so because the IR doesn't match.

Wait, another approach: product 1's 1H NMR has three signals. The singlet at 4.79 (2H), then a multiplet around 2.2 (10H), and a 2H at 1.94.

Wait, considering that the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe product 1 is a diketone. But how would dielimination lead to a carbonyl? Or perhaps a diepoxide.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming two ketones. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of a ketone via a ring contraction or expansion. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. If two bridgehead Brs are present, perhaps elimination and ring contraction forms a cyclopropane ring, but that's just a guess.

Wait, another idea: Maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination, but that's for vicinal diols. Not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double E2 elimination, each Br leaving as HBr, forming a double bond. But with two Brs, maybe two double bonds? That may not be possible in adamantane, but perhaps a diene is formed.

Wait, but then the IR would show a peak for a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the diene is then oxidized. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with KOH, perhaps it's more likely elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene. But then the NMR wouldn't show a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an endo-diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group through substitution. But KOH is a strong base, and SN2 would be possible for bridgehead positions? Wait, bridgehead positions in adamantane are typically not good for SN2 because of the structure. So maybe elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to an elimination and ring opening, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms. Upon treatment with KOH, each Br could be replaced by an -O- group, leading to an oxide. But that would form a di-epoxide perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is an oxide with two adjacent O atoms. But that's not possible because O can't form a single bond with two adjacent O atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diepoxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give a diol, and the IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned here, so probably not.

Wait, maybe it's a gem-diol, but again, that's not matching the IR.

Hmm. Maybe I should move to the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, promoting Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of cyclization or acylation.

Wait, but product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet). That's a key point. A singlet implies that the two Hs are not split by neighboring Hs, so they're likely in a symmetric environment. Maybe it's an OCH2O group, as in an epoxide. Because in an epoxide, the two Hs on the CH2 group are equivalent and would give a singlet. But in that case, the IR should show an epoxide's C-O-C stretching around 1250-1050 cm-1, but the IR here shows 1720, indicating a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an epoxide.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, if the two Brs are replaced by a carbonyl group. But that seems unlikely with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a bridgehead carbonyl group. Maybe each Br is eliminated, and the adjacent C-H is abstracted, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe each Br in 1,3-dibromoadamantane is part of a bridge, and elimination of HBr from each bridge forms a carbonyl. So, perhaps each bridge now has a ketone group.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me try to imagine the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. If two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, elimination could form a double bond, but bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so maybe the structure undergoes a rearrangement, perhaps forming a bridge with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each elimination of HBr from each Br leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, each becomes a carbonyl. So, product 1 would have two ketone groups. But then the IR would show two peaks around 1720, but it's just a single peak. Alternatively, maybe a single ketone is formed.

Wait, perhaps only one Br is eliminated, but that would leave the other Br. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single carbonyl group. For example, dehydrohalogenation of one Br leads to a double bond, and then the base could cause some rearrangement to form a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an ester or an amide, but without any other reagents, probably not.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl. The NMR has a singlet at 4.79, which is a bit upfield for a carbonyl adjacent group. Maybe that's an OCH2 group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H singlet) might be an -OCH2O- group, but as I thought earlier, that would be an epoxide. But then the IR doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal. Acetals typically have OCH2 groups as singlets. So if product 1 is an acetal, then the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2O group, but that would lower the chemical shift. Wait, but in that case, the IR carbonyl peak would be absent, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol. But then the IR would show O-H stretch, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me try to think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropanation or some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has a carbonyl group, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Or perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide acts as a Lewis acid to facilitate some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, it might form an enol, but I'm not certain how that would form product 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is a more complex structure. It's a bit unclear.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, and then upon workup with dimethylsulfide (which is a reductive workup), it would form aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen (the one with the highest ppm) is likely near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Its coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens.

So, perhaps each carbonyl group in product 3 is next to a CH2 group, which in turn is next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet or some more complex splitting.

Wait, let me try to piece this together.

If product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2, which is derived from product 1. Product 1 is a ketone. So product 2 could be some kind of diene, perhaps.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me try to outline the possible structures.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1: ?

2. product 1 → product 2: ?

3. product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis.

Alternative approach: perhaps product 1 is a diol. But without O-H in the IR, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, product 1 is an epoxide. Then product 2 would undergo some reaction with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring. But that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a lactone. But again, without more data, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it forms a diketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketonoadamantane. Then, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which fits two ketone groups.

But then, product 2 would be formed when product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Maybe a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane doesn't have an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a diene formed by elimination.

Wait, when a diketone is heated, sometimes it can undergo elimination to form a conjugated diene. Wait, but how? Maybe through some kind of enol elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the ketone could undergo a ring-opening to form a diene. But I'm not exactly clear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. Ozonolysis of a cyclopropane would not typically cleave it, though. It would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an strained cyclic diene, which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the product 3's NMR. The most deshielded hydrogen is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure is a chain with a carbonyl, perhaps something like CH2-CO.

Wait, when ozonolysis is done, if product 2 has a diene, then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a diene, maybe 1,3-butadiene derivative, then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution.

But in adamantane derivatives, the structure is more rigid. So perhaps product 2 is a bridgehead diene, which upon ozonolysis forms two ketones.

Alternatively, if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let's say product 2 is a bridgehead diene, such as a bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds, leading to two carbonyl groups. Then, the resulting structure would have CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

In the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one next to the carbonyl. Let's imagine a structure like:

O=CH2-CH2-CO-O= 

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO.

But no, more likely, each carbonyl is at the end of a chain. For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, which upon ozonolysis becomes two aldehydes.

Wait, but in this case, product 3 would be two aldehyde groups. The H adjacent to the aldehyde would be a triplet if each is adjacent to one CH2 group. Or perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So, the structure could be something like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO. But that seems symmetrical.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, the NMR would show equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps each aldehyde proton is a triplet, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet because they have no neighboring Hs (since aldehydes are RCHO, and the H is at the end).

Wait, but in the question, the most deshielded H isn't from an aldehyde. Because aldehyde protons are usually the most deshielded, but the question specifies to exclude those that exchange with deuterated solvent. So perhaps it's not an aldehyde.

Wait, then maybe the H is adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester group.

Wait, another possibility: product 3 might have a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, the structure could be something like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-..., but I'm not certain.

In such a scenario, the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the adjacent CH2 group. Let's say each CH2 is next to another CH2. So the H in the middle would couple with two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet. But if there's more coupling, like from another adjacent group, the pattern could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: if each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2, then the Hs on each CH2 would have coupling with two neighboring Hs. For example, each H is next to two Hs on one side and perhaps another on the other. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

In this case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two neighboring Hs on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets or something similar.

But let me think about the coupling. Let's say each CH2-CO is part of a chain. For example, (CO)CH2CH2(CO). The central CH2 would be between two CH2 groups, each attached to a CO. So, the central H would have coupling with the Hs on both adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 group is next to another, so the Hs on each CH2 would have coupling with Hs from both sides. So, for each H, it's coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, but that would result in a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the product is a cyclopropane ring, ozonolysis might not do much. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, where each ketone is flanked by CH2 groups.

In this case, the Hs on the CH2 next to the ketone would each be adjacent to two other Hs from the same CH2 group and perhaps another from the next group.

Wait, each H on the CH2 next to the ketone would couple with the two Hs on their own CH2 (but they're equivalent, so it's a singlet within the CH2) and also with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, the splitting would be based on the adjacent CH2 group.

If a CH2 group is next to another CH2, each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the neighboring CH2. That would lead to a triplet (since each H is split by two Hs on the adjacent group). But if each CH2 is next to two other CH2 groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, for example, consider a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO. The CH2 groups in the middle would have Hs that are next to two Hs on each side. So each H would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups on both sides. The coupling with each adjacent CH2 would be a triplet. So, the overall coupling would be a triplet of triplets, leading to a 9-line pattern, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's a simple CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is then next to another CH2 group. So, each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two other CH2 groups, each H would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the options given, the choices are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, let me think about the structure again. Suppose product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl on one side and another CH2 group on the other. So, the Hs on the central CH2 would be coupled with two Hs from each adjacent CH2.

Wait, no, each H is only coupled with neighboring Hs. If the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, it would only couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. If the adjacent group is a CH2, then each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a -CH2-CH2- group, each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Then each H would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the neighboring CH2. Wait, but each H is only adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring group, not their own CH2 (since Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent and don't split each other).

So, each H on a CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to imagine the precise structure.

If product 3 has a structure like:

CO-O-CH2-CH2-CO-O

Wait, no, because that's an ester, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, product 3 could have two ketone groups at the ends, with CH2 groups in between. For example:

CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2

Wait, but that seems too long. Alternatively, perhaps it's a symmetrical molecule with two CO groups at each end, connected by CH2 groups.

In that case, the Hs on the CH2 groups adjacent to the CO would each be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would be coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a single CH2 group between two CO groups, so the Hs are adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but they don't split each other) and two Hs on the neighboring CH2 group (but I'm not sure if that's the case).

Wait, maybe the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

So, the middle CH2 would be between two CO groups. Each H on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to the two Hs on the same CH2 (but they don't split each other, so it's a singlet within the CH2) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but each H would have coupling with four Hs? No, because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs. Let me think more carefully.

In the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the middle two CH2 groups are each adjacent to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 (next to the CO) would be adjacent to the two Hs on the same CH2 (but they're equivalent, so no splitting) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be split by two Hs, resulting in a triplet.

But the adjacent CH2 group also has two Hs, so each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups, each of which is adjacent to a CO. So each H in the middle CH2 would be adjacent to the two Hs on the left CH2 and two Hs on the right CH2. So each H would have coupling with four Hs, but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs within a certain range. Alternatively, perhaps each H couples with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 on one side, leading to a triplet, and two Hs from the other side, leading to another triplet. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets, leading to nine peaks, but in reality, they might overlap into a multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, but I think that would result in a triplet of triplets, which would be a complex splitting.

Wait, but perhaps the CH2 groups are all equivalent, so the splitting would be simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is only next to one other CH2 group. For example, if product 3 has a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 (the second one) is between two CH2 groups. Each H in this middle CH2 would be coupled with two Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that the H is part of a -CH2-CH2- group, each adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to coupling with two Hs on each adjacent group, making a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, each H would be split by two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to a third CH2 group. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the H is on a CH2 group that is next to another CH2 group, it would be a triplet. If it's next to two different CH2 groups, the splitting might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that is next to a CH group, which is itself next to another CH2 group. Then, the H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another from the CH group. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

In ozonolysis, a diene is cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a conjugated diene, such as 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes, each with a CH2 group adjacent.

Wait, 1,3-pentadiene would ozonolyse to form two formaldehyde molecules. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would form a diketone or two ketones.

Wait, if product 2 is a cyclobutene derivative, ozonolysis would cleave it into a diketone.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, the structure could be something like O=C-R, where R is a chain.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to determine the coupling.

Wait, perhaps each ketone is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group. So, the structure could be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

In this case, the middle CH2 groups would each have two Hs. Each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but that's a singlet) and two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent and don't split each other. So each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the left CH2 and two on the right CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Because each H would see two Hs from one side and two from the other, the splitting would be a triplet from each coupling, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

But wait, if each H is only coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH2, then it's a triplet. If it's coupled with two Hs on both sides, that would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled with two Hs from one adjacent CH2 group, so the coupling is a triplet.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think of an example. Consider the structure:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

Each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl. The middle CH2 groups (if any) would have Hs that are adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

Wait, in this structure, each CH2 is between two carbonyls:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

No, wait, that's not possible because the molecule would collapse. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO.

In that case, the central CH2 would be between two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a carbonyl. So each H in the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would couple with two Hs on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But that's a lot of splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with the adjacent CH2 group on one side, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are only coupled with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Given the options, the most likely answer is a triplet. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the 1H NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H is likely a methine (CH) group, but the question says to exclude those that exchange with D2O. Alternatively, it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

If it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, then the Hs on that CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2 group. If the adjacent group is a CH2, then each H would be a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing a multi-step organic reaction sequence to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, undergoes a reaction with KOH.  
   - KOH is a strong base, and elimination is likely due to the presence of two bromine atoms in a vicinal-like arrangement.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The ¹H NMR of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting an -OCH₂- group, and other signals consistent with a carbonyl-containing structure.  
   - Product 1 is likely a diketone or a related structure with a carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used to catalyze reactions like cyclization or Friedel-Crafts.  
   - Given the carbonyl group in product 1, product 2 is likely a diene formed via cyclization or rearrangement.  
   - This diene structure sets the stage for the next reaction.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is formed by breaking the double bonds in product 2, resulting in a structure with carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Analysis of the ¹H NMR of Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group, likely in a CH₂ group.  
   - This CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to coupling with two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂.  
   - The coupling pattern for such a hydrogen is a **triplet**, as it is split by two equivalent hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
