Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think through this.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. Right, rhombohedral has all sides equal, and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. And the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, interatomic distance... that's the distance between atoms along the edges of the unit cell. So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is about interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I recall that the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the formula using the reciprocal lattice. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) * cosθ ), but wait, that might not be exactly right. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with the hexagonal system. Oh wait, no, for a general rhombohedral system, the formula for d_hkl is a bit more involved.

Wait, I think the correct formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh)/(a^2) * cos(alpha)

Because in rhombohedral, all the angles are the same, so alpha is 30 degrees here. So let's plug in the numbers.

Given that h, k, l are all 1 for the (111) plane.

So h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Let me compute the numerator first.

Compute h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then compute 2(hk + kl + lh) = 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

So the first part is 3/a², and the second part is 6/a² multiplied by cos(alpha).

Wait, the formula is 1/d² = (3) / a² - (6) * cos(30°) / a².

Wait, because the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) / a² - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos(alpha) / a². Wait, is that correct? Because in a rhombohedral system, the Miller indices are h, k, l, and the angles are all alpha.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + kl + lh) (cos α) ) )

Wait, no, wait. Because in a cubic system, which is a special case of rhombohedral where alpha is 90°, the formula simplifies. But for non-cubic rhombohedral, we have to account for the angles.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the correct formula. According to what I vaguely remember, for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about the sign. Let me think: in a cubic system, cos α is zero because alpha is 90 degrees, so the formula becomes sqrt(h² +k² + l²) in the denominator. Which is correct for cubic systems.

So in this case, alpha is 30 degrees, which is less than 90, so cos 30 is positive. So the term 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha would be positive, so it's subtracted.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, if the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/a² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha / a², then that's correct.

So let me compute 1/d².

Compute the numerator:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

2(hk + kl + lh) = 6.

cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 1/d² = (3 - 6 * 0.8660)/(10^2).

Wait, 3 - 6*(0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Hmm, that would make 1/d² negative, which can't be right because d is real. That must mean I have the formula wrong.

Wait, that can't be possible. So maybe I have the sign wrong in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d^2 = (h² +k² + l²)/(a^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha/(a^2).

Because in a rhombohedral system, when alpha is less than 90 degrees, the interplanar distance would be shorter than in the cubic case. Let me try that.

So in that case, 1/d² = [3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2)] / (10)^2.

Wait, 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) is 3 * sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So 1/d^2 =8.196 / 100 → 0.08196.

d^2 =1/0.08196 ≈12.196 → d≈sqrt(12.196) ≈3.492 Angstroms.

Wait, but that's way too small, and the options are around 9 Angstroms. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be derived from the unit cell vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are involved, but perhaps a better way is to use the general formula for interplanar spacing.

The general formula for d_hkl in terms of the lattice parameters is:

1/d^2 = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α / a².

Wait, but if that gives a negative value, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, I must have the formula wrong. Let me think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a cube that's been skewed in all three directions. The unit cell vectors are a, a, a, but with angles alpha, etc.

The interplanar distance can be calculated using the relation:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, but in that case, for (111) plane:

h=k=l=1.

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 2(1+1+1) * cos 30).

2(3) =6.

So 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3-3*sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative. That can't be right. So this formula must be incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α / a².

Wait, but that would lead to the same problem as before. So what am I doing wrong here?

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach.

Another method to find d is using the volume of the unit cell and the projection of the plane.

Wait, the formula might be different when angles are not 90 degrees.

Wait, I found another formula: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (h k + k l + l h) cos α )

But that would give a negative denominator as before.

Wait, perhaps I should take the absolute value, but that doesn't make sense. Because if the result under the square root is negative, it's impossible.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (h k + k l + l h) cos α )

Because in that case, when alpha is 90 degrees, cos alpha is zero, and the formula reduces to the cubic case.

Wait, let's test that. For a cubic system, alpha is 90, so cos alpha is 0. So the denominator becomes sqrt(3), leading to d = a / sqrt(3) for (111) plane. Which makes sense.

But in our case, alpha is 30 degrees, cos alpha is positive (sqrt(3)/2).

So let's try using this formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

So for (111):

h=1, k=1, l=1.

h² +k² +l² =3.

2(hk + kl + lh) = 6.

cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6 * 0.866 = 3 + 5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) = approx 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstrom.

But wait, the answer options are around 9 Angstrom. So this can't be right. So I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angle as 180 - alpha, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Let me think about the definitions.

In rhombohedral systems, the unit cell is defined by three vectors of equal length a, each making the same angle alpha with each other.

The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, but for alpha=90 degrees, this correctly gives the cubic case. Wait, no, because for alpha=90, cos alpha is zero, so denominator becomes sqrt(3), so d is a/sqrt(3), which is correct.

Wait, but in our case, alpha is 30 degrees, so cos alpha is positive. So the denominator becomes larger, leading to a smaller d. But the options are much larger than a=10.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Another possibility: the formula uses cos(180 - alpha) which would be negative, but alpha is 30, so cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Let me try that. So formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk +kl +lh) cos (180-alpha) )

Which is 3 +6*(-0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196.

Still negative, which is impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I should use the opposite sign.

Wait, another formula I found online: for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2)(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But when I use that, for (111), it's 3 -6*(0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196 → denominator sqrt(-ve) is impossible.

This is confusing.

Hmm. Maybe I should try another approach. Let me think about the unit cell vectors.

The unit vectors are a, a, a with angles alpha between each pair.

The plane (111) has normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector is (h, k, l) scaled by 2π.

Wait, perhaps the reciprocal basis vectors can be used.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [1, 1, 1]/ sqrt(3) )

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the plane equation.

The interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But when alpha is 30 degrees, cos 30 is positive, so denominator can be negative. That's impossible.

Wait, this is really confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a special case of the hexagonal lattice? No, rhombohedral is a separate system.

Alternative approach: using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) (1, 1, 1) / sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) - 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos alpha )

Wait, no, that might not be the right way.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the general formula for the interplanar distance in a lattice with vectors a, b, c, and angles between them. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (a^2)/(a^2)) + (k^2 (b^2)/(a^2)) + (l^2 (c^2)/(a^2)) - 2 hk (a.b)/(a^2) - 2 kl (a.c)/(a^2) - 2 lh (b.c)/(a^2) ) )

But in rhombohedral, a = b = c = a, and angles between a and b, a and c, and b and c are all alpha.

So a.b = |a||b| cos alpha = a^2 cos alpha.

Similarly for a.c and b.c.

So putting it all together:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2hk cos alpha - 2kl cos alpha - 2 lh cos alpha ) * (1/a)

Wait, because (a.b)/(a^2) is cos alpha, so each term becomes cos alpha.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha ) / a.

So d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But wait, that's the same formula as before.

So for our case, (111) plane:

h^2 +k^2 + l^2 =3.

2(hk + kl + lh)=6.

So denominator is sqrt(3 -6 cos 30°).

Which would be sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)) = sqrt(3-3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, 3 is about 3, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 is about 5.196.

3 -5.196= -2.196 → sqrt of negative number? Impossible. So this suggests that a (111) plane doesn't exist in this rhombohedral structure? That can't be right. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the absolute value, but that doesn't make sense physically.

Hmm, maybe the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha ) / (a^2).

Wait, but then that would give 1/d^2 = (3 - 6*(0.866)) /100 → (3-5.196)/100 → (-2.196)/100 → negative.

Which again is impossible.

Am I missing something? Like the possibility that the formula uses cos(pi - alpha) instead of cos alpha? Because sometimes angles are measured as the angle between vectors from the positive side, and sometimes as the supplement.

Wait, let's think about the angle in the formula. In a rhombohedral structure, the angle between the lattice vectors is alpha, but perhaps the formula uses the angle as 180 - alpha? Because sometimes the angle between vectors in crystallography is the obtuse angle, like in the case of hexagonal close-packed structures.

So if alpha is 30 degrees, then 180 - alpha is 150 degrees, and cos 150 is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Let's try that. So cos alpha in the formula is cos(150), which is -0.866.

So 3 -6*(-0.866) →3 +5.196=8.196.

So 1/d^2 =8.196/(10)^2 =0.08196 → d^2=12.196 →d≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this is even smaller than before and the options are around 9 Angstrom. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Let me try to think of the interatomic distance as the edge length a, which is 10 Angstroms.

The (111) plane: in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3) ≈5.774 Angstrom. But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system with angles of 30 degrees.

So maybe the interplanar distance is longer than the cubic case, because the structure is more "stretched" due to the smaller angles.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

h² +k² +l²=3.

2 (hk + kl + lh)=6.

cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 +6 *0.866) =sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, that's way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I'm completely off track.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. The formula uses cos(180 - alpha), which is cos 150.

So for the formula d =a / sqrt( ... ), if I use cos 150= -0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 -6*(-0.866))=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Still the same.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm using the wrong sign in the formula.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector.

The plane (111) has a normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector multiplied by some factor.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the distance between two adjacent planes in the direction perpendicular to the (111) plane.

Wait, another formula I found is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (cos α) )

Wait, but with alpha=30, this would give a smaller d than cubic, which would be about 5.774. So for (111), the distance in cubic is about 5.774, in our case, 3.49. But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but something else? Oh wait, the interatomic distance in the problem is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, the problem says 'interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom.' Hmm, what's the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral system?

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a, the lattice parameter. So a=10 Ang.

Wait, but then the interplanar distance for (111) would be about 3.49 Ang, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the interplanar distance with something else. Wait, the formula I've been using is for the interplanar spacing in reciprocal space, but perhaps I should be using a different approach.

Wait, another approach: using the volume of the reciprocal unit cell.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors for rhombohedral are given by:

b1 = ( 1/a ) (1,1,1 ) / sqrt(3) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But this would mean for (111) plane, the denominator is sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2))=sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 = -2.196 → sqrt of negative number. So that can't be.

Therefore, perhaps the correct formula is with a plus sign instead of a minus.

So d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which gives d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(8.196)=≈3.49 Ang. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm. All right, perhaps I should look at the options and see if any of them make sense given the formula. Let's think: the options are around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, what if I made a mistake in the formula and the denominator is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha ), but in this case, I have to take the absolute value.

So 3 -6*0.866 =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Absolute value is 2.196.

So sqrt(2.196)=approx 1.482.

d=10 / 1.482≈6.74 Ang. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should try another approach, such as using the plane's intercepts and the lattice parameters.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But since the denominator is negative, it's impossible. So perhaps the formula is not applicable for certain hkl indices when alpha is less than 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos (180 - alpha) )

Which would be 3 -6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196 → sqrt(8.196)=2.863 → d=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 120 degrees instead of 30? That would be a more typical case where the formula would work, but the question says 30 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different because rhombohedral can be either acute or obtuse. Wait, perhaps in this case, the formula requires the angles to be in a certain convention.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But in that case, with alpha=30, cos=0.866.

So for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(8.196)=≈3.49 Ang. No match.

Wait, but the options are in the 9s. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (h k + k l + l h) cos alpha )

But for (111), that's 3-6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Hmm, maybe I should take the reciprocal of the sqrt of the absolute value of that.

So sqrt(2.196)=1.482 → d=10/1.482≈6.74 Ang. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the supplement angle, 180-30=150, cos= -0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=sqrt(8.196)=2.863 → d=3.49 Ang. Still no.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the units and the options. All options are around 9 Ang. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and it's multiplied by a factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But for (111), let's compute it:

3 -6*(cos30) =3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Wait, negative. So maybe I'm using the reciprocal plane. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos(alpha) )

But if that's negative, perhaps I should take the reciprocal. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the square of the denominator and take the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

Which would give d=10/sqrt( 3 +6*(0.866) )=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Ang.

But again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using a different approach. Let me think about the relation between the Miller indices and the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Another formula I found online is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But when alpha is less than 90, cos alpha is positive, so the denominator could become negative, which would be impossible. So perhaps in such cases, the formula can't be applied, implying that certain hkl planes are not allowed?

But the question is asking for (111), so it must exist.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the formula is actually correct, but the answer would require taking the absolute value under the square root.

So for (111), denominator is sqrt( |3 -6*0.866| )=sqrt(2.196)=1.482 → d=10/1.482≈6.74 Ang. But 6.74 isn't among the options.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstrom, but I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator's sqrt.

Wait, let me compute 1/d^2 = (3 -6*0.866)/10^2 → (3-5.196)/100 →-0.02196 → d^2= -45.7 → which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is 1/d^2 = (3 +6*0.866)/10^2 →0.08196 →d≈3.49 Ang.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I've been using the wrong formula all along. Let me think of it as a triclinic system. No, rhombohedral is a special case of triclinic, but perhaps the formula is similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the crystal as a hexagonal close-packed structure, but that's a different system.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the dot product. Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance is the distance between two planes in the crystal. The (111) plane can be represented by the equation h x +k y +l z =n. The distance between two adjacent planes is given by d = |n| / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + ... ), but I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( ( (h^2)(1) + (k^2)(1) + (l^2)(1) ) - 2 hk cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma - 2 lh cos alpha )

But in rhombohedral, all angles are alpha, so:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

Same as before.

So again, the same problem arises.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

In that case, for (111):

3 +6*(0.866)=8.196 → sqrt(8.196)=2.863 →d=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang.

But again, no match.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think of it in terms of vectors.

The plane (111) has a normal vector (1,1,1). The distance from the origin to the plane is |(1,1,1) · r| / |(1,1,1)|, where r is a point on the plane.

But in the crystal, the lattice points are at (a, a, a), etc., but I'm not sure how that translates to the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance between two adjacent (111) planes can be found by projecting the lattice vectors onto the direction perpendicular to the plane.

So the normal vector to the plane is (1,1,1). The unit vector is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

The interplanar distance d is the projection of the lattice vector along this normal direction.

But in a rhombohedral system, each lattice vector is a =10 Ang, and the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

So the displacement between two adjacent planes is along the normal vector. To find d, we can take the component of the lattice vector along the normal.

Wait, perhaps the distance between the planes can be found by considering the movement along the normal direction.

Hmm, perhaps each plane is spaced by a multiple of the lattice parameter in that direction.

Wait, this is getting too vague. I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent and not finding the way to get the options' numbers, perhaps I should take a guess based on the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the denominator is (3 +6*(cos 30)).

So denominator sqrt(3 +6*0.866)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang. But the options are much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But since it's negative, I take the reciprocal.

So 1/d = sqrt( (3 -6*0.866) )/10 → but that would give a negative sqrt which is invalid.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Considering the time I've spent, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Ang. But I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for cos(alpha). Wait, alpha is 30 degrees, so cos(30)=0.866. Wait, but perhaps I should be using cos(60) or another angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos(60) )

Wait, but 60 is not given. That would give 3 -6*(0.5)=3-3=0→d undefined.

No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2*cos(alpha), but that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos(60) )

Which would be 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6 → sqrt(6)=2.449→d=10/2.449≈4.082 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm really not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the relation between the interplanar distance and the lattice parameters for a rhombohedral system.

Another formula I found: d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ] - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But as before, this gives a negative denominator for (111) when alpha is 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos alpha )

But take the absolute value of the denominator, which would make d=10 / sqrt( |3 -6*0.866| )=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.482≈6.74 Ang.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Ang. Because 9.54 is close to 10 when divided by sqrt(3/2), but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}{a^2} - \frac{2(hk + kl + lh)}{a^2} \cos \alpha
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting these values:

1. Compute \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \).
2. Compute \( 2(hk + kl + lh) = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 6 \).
3. Substitute \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{3}{10^2} - \frac{6}{10^2} \cdot 0.866
\]

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{3}{100} - \frac{5.196}{100} = \frac{3 - 5.196}{100} = \frac{-2.196}{100}
\]

This results in a negative value for \( \frac{1}{d^2} \), which is physically impossible. This suggests that the formula may not be directly applicable for \( \alpha = 30^\circ \), or that the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this specific rhombohedral system is not well-defined under these conditions.

Given the options provided and the lack of a valid result from the formula, the most reasonable choice based on the problem setup and the options is:
