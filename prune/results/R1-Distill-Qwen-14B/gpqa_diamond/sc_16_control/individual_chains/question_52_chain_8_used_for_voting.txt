Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it can influence their overall temperature, which in turn affects things like the ionization levels and emission lines.

Let me read the question again. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots vs. has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio goes down. So the ratio without spots is higher than when it has spots. We need to find the ratio (n1/n2) when no spots divided by when spots are present.

I think this has to do with the Saha equation, which describes the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Saha equation relates the number of ions to the electron density and temperature. But wait, this is about neutral atoms in two energy levels. Oh, right, for energy levels within the same atom, the Boltzmann equation comes into play.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of ( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 > E1. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight.

Wait, but in this problem, they're looking at neutral Ti atoms in two levels, so ionization isn't the main factor here. So the ratio of n1 to n2 (n1 being the lower energy level, n2 the higher) would be proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponential would decrease as T increases.

So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by the ratio of statistical weights (g1/g2).

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the overall temperature of the star decreases (from 6000 to 5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. Because when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is bigger (since T is denominator and gets smaller), so the exponent is larger, making exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) larger. So n1/n2 would be larger when T is lower, but wait, that's the opposite of what's observed.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio observed is n1/n2, which is decreasing when the star has spots. So when the star has spots (T_eff=5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when it's spotless (6000 K).

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So higher T would make the ratio n1/n2 smaller because the exponential is smaller. Wait:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Let's correct that. The correct expression is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, that's right. So if E2 > E1, then when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponential becomes smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases. Because the exponential term is in the numerator.

Wait, suppose E2-E1 is a positive value, let's say ΔE. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

As T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

But in the problem, when there are spots (T=5500 K), the ratio decreases compared to when there are no spots (6000 K). Wait, no—wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. So T_eff is 5500 K. So when T_eff is lower, T is lower. So according to the equation, n1/n2 would be higher when T is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That is, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. Hmm, but according to the formula, lower T would make n1/n2 higher.

This seems contradictory. Did I get the formula wrong? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are such that level 2 is higher than level 1, so E2 > E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

At higher T, the exponential is smaller. So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

So when T decreases, n1/n2 increases.

But in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which is when T_eff is 5500 K. So spotless: T=6000, ratio is higher. With spots: T=5500, ratio is lower. So the observed ratio is lower when T is lower. But according to the formula, ratio should be higher when T is lower.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So maybe I have the levels reversed. Let me think: perhaps in the problem, level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is negative. Then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)) which is (g1/g2) * exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) )

In this case, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) ) increases. So n1/n2 increases as T increases.

Wait, but the observed ratio is decreasing when T decreases. Let me think of the scenario. When the star has spots, the effective temperature drops. If in the spot, the temperature is lower, but wait, the overall photosphere's Teff is 5500. But the spots themselves are cooler. Hmm, but the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, I'm not sure about that. But the question is about the photosphere as a whole. So when 40% is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.

So the star's overall Teff is lower, which means that in the photosphere, the temperature has dropped. So the temperatures in the photosphere have gone down.

If the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots, that means when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So going from T=6000 to T=5500 causes n1/n2 to decrease.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if the levels are such that E1 > E2 (so ΔE negative), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) ) increases. Thus, n1/n2 increases. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. That's the observed behavior. So in this case, E2 < E1, so level 1 is higher than level 2.

So the transition is from level 1 to level 2, or vice versa? The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the near ultraviolet. So emission or absorption line at that wavelength. But perhaps that's not directly relevant for this problem, unless we need to calculate the energy difference.

Wait, the transition's wavelength is given. So we can find the energy difference between the two levels. Using the relation E = hc/λ.

Yes, so let's compute the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need the exact value, but perhaps the ratio will involve the temperatures.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write the equation for each case.

(n1/n2)_no_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )

Wait no, earlier I thought E2 is lower than E1, so E2 - E1 is negative. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = - |ΔE|.

So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases, so the ratio (n1/n2) increases.

But in the problem, the ratio decreases when there are spots (lower T), which would imply that when T decreases, the ratio goes down. Wait, but according to the equation, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller, so (n1/n2) becomes smaller. Wait, no:

Wait, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) )

If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller. So (n1/n2) decreases as T decreases.

Ah, I see. So when T is lower, (n1/n2) is lower. Which is exactly what the problem says. So the ratio decreases when the star has spots (T is lower). So that makes sense.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) * exp( - |ΔE|/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( - |ΔE|/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so we have exp( [ - |ΔE|/(k T1) + |ΔE|/(k T2) ] ) )

Which is exp( |ΔE| / (k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, let me compute the exponent:

The numerator is [ - |ΔE|/(k T1) + |ΔE|/(k T2) ]

Factor out |ΔE|/(k):

= |ΔE|/(k) ( -1/T1 + 1/T2 )

= |ΔE|/(k) ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So the exponent is |ΔE|/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Note that T1 is the higher temperature (6000 K), and T2 is 5500 K.

So 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive.

So the exponent is positive. So the ratio is exp( positive value ), which is greater than 1. So (n1/n2)_no_spots is larger than when there are spots. So the factor is greater than 1, which matches the problem statement.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, wait the denominator would be (n1/n2)_with_spots:

So the factor is (no spots) / (with spots) = [ (n1/n2)_no_spots ] / [ (n1/n2)_with_spots ]

Which is the same as [ exp( - |ΔE|/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - |ΔE|/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( [ - |ΔE|/(k T1) + |ΔE|/(k T2) ] )

= exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because T2 < T1, 1/T2 > 1/T1, so the exponent is positive.

So the factor is exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Now, I need to compute |ΔE|.

We have the wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

Energy E = hc/λ

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J

But we can also express this in terms of eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J.

So E ≈ 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV

Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait. Wait, 1448 Å is about 145 nm, which is in the near UV. The energy of a photon there would be about 8.57 eV? That seems a bit high because visible light is about 1.5-3 eV. But wait, higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons have higher energy.

Wait, 1448 A is 0.1448 nm. So, the energy E is hc/λ.

Wait, let me compute that again.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 299792458 m/s (exact value, but 3e8 is good enough)

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high for a transition in an atom, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is for ionization, but no, the problem states it's between two energy levels (neutral Ti), so it's an electronic transition, which can have higher energy.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

As above, so 8.57 eV.

But wait, for Ti, which has an atomic number around 22, the ionization energy is about 6.98 eV (first ionization potential). So an 8.57 eV transition would be higher than that, which would mean it's an excitation from a higher energy level to an even higher one, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake converting wavelength to energy. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would be better. Let's compute the energy difference in terms of k*T.

Wait, the ratio involves the exponential of (ΔE)/(k*T). So perhaps I can compute the exponent terms for each temperature.

Wait, but first, I need the energy difference in terms of eV or in terms of k*T in eV.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio using the temperatures.

Let me think. The ratio factor is exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, so |ΔE| = hc/λ.

So substituting that:

exp( (hc)/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So let me compute (hc)/(λ k).

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448e-10 m

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So (h c)/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = approx 1.989e-30 J·m/K

So (h c)/(λ k ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.989e-30 ≈ 1e5 (approx 100,000) K.

Wait, more precisely:

1.9878e-25 / 1.989e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.989) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5.

So (h c)/(λ k ) ≈ 1e5 K.

So that term is 1e5 K.

Then, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) 1/K.

Compute that:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

So difference is 0.000015151

So (1e5 K) * (0.000015151 1/K) = 1.5151 K.

So the exponent is 1.5151.

So the factor is exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151.

Hmm, e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953. So let me compute 1.5151:

e^1.5151 ≈ Let's use a calculator approach.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because e^1.504 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, e^1.504 ≈ 4.5.

So e^1.5151 is a bit higher than 4.5. Let's compute it more accurately.

1.5151 - 1.504 = 0.0111.

So e^0.0111 ≈ 1.01116 (since for small x, e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2. So 0.01116^2 is about 0.000125, so approximately 1.01116 + 0.000125 ≈ 1.011285.

So 4.5 * 1.011285 ≈ 4.545 (approx 4.55).

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, the options are: A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

So the answer should be C) ~4.5.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into this expression, the statistical weights \( g_1/g_2 \) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)) by \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The factor \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \) is computed using \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Substituting into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(9.95 \times 10^4 \cdot 0.0000151\right) = \exp(1.515).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.515) \approx 4.55 \), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
