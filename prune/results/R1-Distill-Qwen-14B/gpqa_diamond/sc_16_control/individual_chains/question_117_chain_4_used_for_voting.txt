Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to them being chiral. Right, and that usually involves having a chiral center, or maybe some kind of stereogenic element like a plane of symmetry or something else causing the asymmetry.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this is a biphenyl structure. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each phenyl ring. Let me visualize it. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, so the structure is such that each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxy methyl ester at 2. Now, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, especially optical, I think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it won't be chiral. But if they're not, then maybe it can have enantiomers.

Wait, in this case, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. The 2 and 6 positions are meta to each other on each benzene ring. So each ring has a nitro and a methyl ester. But since the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the connection, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me think about the structure. Oh wait, the main chain is the biphenyl, so each ring is connected at position 1. So ring A has substituents at 2 and 6, and ring B also at positions 2' and 6' I suppose. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxy methyl group. So maybe the entire molecule is symmetrical, but wait, perhaps when the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged so that the two rings have different groups, but in this case, they seem symmetrical. Wait, no, both rings have the same substituents. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the way the substituents are arranged leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry. Wait, if each ring has two groups at 2 and 6, but the substituents are the same on each ring, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the axis connecting the two rings, making it achiral. Wait, but wait, the substituents are nitro and the ester groups. Wait, if both rings have the same groups in the same positions, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. So maybe this compound doesn't show optical isomerism. Or am I missing something? Maybe I should think about the possibility of the biphenyl having a twist that leads to asymmetry, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a center of symmetry or a plane, making it not chiral. Hmm, maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3O-CO-OCH2CH2OH? Wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So when esterified, it becomes CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CH2CH3)-COOCH3. Wait, wait no: 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Hmm, so the structure is: the central carbon is CH(OH), attached to another CH3, a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydroxyl. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So the ester is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, looking at the central carbon (the second carbon), it's connected to:
- CH3 (from CH3-),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the rest is just CH2 maybe? Wait, wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So the ester would have that structure but the COOH becomes COOCH3.

So the ester is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: a methyl group (from CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and another CH3 group (since it's CH3-CH(OH)-...). Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and another H?

Wait, no, the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:
- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and a H.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and another H.

Wait, so the central carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That makes it a chiral center. So yes, this compound has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 definitely shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. Structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups and another carbon (but wait, no, in benzophenone, it's (Ph)2CO. So the structure is Ar-CO-Ar. The central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded, so it's not a stereogenic center. So no chiral centers. Are there any other possibilities for chirality? Maybe if there's a plane of symmetry. The molecule is symmetrical because both substituents are phenyl groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So benzophenone doesn't show optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically it's (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with two methyl ester groups. Structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, wait. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, right? So the structure has a double bond between the two central carbons. So the diester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? Wait, no, wait, no. Let me think. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the structure is butenedioic acid with the double bond in the middle.

So dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups: OMe groups. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH group with the two ester groups on each end. Wait, no, the correct structure is the two COOCH3 groups on either end of the double bond. So it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, each carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. So each of the two COOH groups becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? Wait, no, that can't be right because of the double bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond.

Wait, but wait, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that's not correct because that would imply that each CH has two esters, but each end would have one. So the correct structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end. So the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Hmm, but wait, each of the two ends of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again. The acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, that's maleic acid. Wait, no, wait. No, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H but no, wait, no. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Fumaric acid is the (E) isomer. So for fumaric acid, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So when fumaric acid is esterified with methanol, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? Wait, no, no. Let me draw it properly. The central part is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the central part is CH=CH. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end. So the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3? No, wait, that's not right.

Wait, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2? No, because each CH would have two substituents. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that's not right because each CH can only have three substituents. Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. No, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the structure is OCH2C=CHCOOCH3? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that's incorrect because that would be a single bond. No, the correct structure is that each of the two central carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that would mean each CH has two COOCH3 groups which can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. So each CH in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and another substituent.

But regardless of the exact structure, what's important is the possibility of geometric isomerism and whether there's a chiral center. Wait, but optical isomerism is about chirality, not geometric isomerism. Wait, no, optical isomerism is about enantiomers, which are chiral. So unless the molecule has a chiral center, it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate is made from fumaric acid, which has a double bond. Fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups on either end of a double bond. When esterified, each becomes a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, but each of the two carbons in the double bond (the C=C) has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each of those carbons is CH(COOCH3)2, which would mean four substituents: two COOCH3, a double bond, and a single bond to another carbon. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two other carbons. Hmm, perhaps the structure is OCH3-COO-C-CH2-CH2-COO-OCH3? No, that's not right because fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the possibility of chirality. For a compound to have optical isomers, it must be chiral, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

So dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each of the CH groups in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. Wait, but that can't be, because each CH would have three substituents plus the double bond. Hmm, no, wait. Each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, that would imply the double bond is between CH2 and CH2, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). But wait, that would imply a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that can't be because CH2=CH2 is ethylene.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about whether dimethyl fumarate can have a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, in fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So in the ester, the groups are arranged trans. So the molecule would be (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Now, does this create any chiral centers? No, because each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two identical groups. Wait, no, because in this case, each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents. Let me think: each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So they are connected to two different groups. Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on each end are same. So each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and another CH2 group, and the double bond. Wait, but that would mean each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents, but the same on each side. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, it's not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a different arrangement.

Wait, another approach: consider whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If each substituent on the double bond is mirrored, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So for dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same, so the molecule is symmetrical. So it doesn't have optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, no, because when the substituents are arranged in a certain way, even if they are same on both ends, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate is not chiral, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of another diastereomer, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. But optical isomerism is about chirality, which requires a chiral center or some form of asymmetry.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can have optical isomerism. So if dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. But looking at the structure, I don't see any chiral centers. Each of the carbons in the ester groups is connected to two identical groups (like OCH3 and another part), so no, no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism. Or wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Oh, wait! Wait a minute. Let me think about the structure again. If the substituents on the double bond are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then perhaps it's chiral. But in fumarate, the substituents are trans, which would mean a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Another approach: let's think about whether any of the options say that 4 is correct. Let me check the options. Option A is 1, 2,4. Option D is 1 and 2. Option A includes 4. But according to my previous reasoning, 4 doesn't show optical isomerism. So what's the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl (2,2)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, each of the two central carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. Wait, that would mean each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking of it wrong.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, even if a molecule isn't a chiral center, it can have other forms of chirality, like in allenes or certain other structures. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers but can have geometric isomerism. But that's a different type of isomerism; optical isomerism is about enantiomers, which are chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the question. The question is which of the four compounds show optical isomerism. So far, I think compounds 2 definitely does, compounds 1 and 4 I'm unsure about, and 3 doesn't. Let me reevaluate each.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the biphenyl group has two phenyl rings connected at position 1. Each phenyl has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate methyl ester at position 2. So the substituents on each phenyl are 2 and 6. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at position 6 and an ester at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So each ring looks like this: positions 2 and 6 have substituents, and the rings are connected at position 1. Now, does this create a chiral center? Well, the biphenyl itself is a group that can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a center of asymmetry. Let me think about the molecule's symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But in this case, each ring has two substituents (nitro and ester) at positions 2 and 6, which are meta. So each ring is identical in terms of substituents. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two rings, making it not chiral. So compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think again. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that their arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe each ring is identical, so the molecule is symmetrical. For example, each ring's substituents are mirror images, leading to a plane of symmetry. So the molecule as a whole would be symmetrical, thus not chiral. So compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the substituents create a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the two rings are not mirror images. Hmm. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So in each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Now, in a biphenyl, the substituents can be in different orientations. But if each substituent is at the same position relative to the connecting bond, then the molecule would be symmetrical. For instance, if each ring's substituents are arranged in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So it would be achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So to summarize:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Yes.
3. No.
4. No, because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but I'm not sure about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that's not right. Let me correct: the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, that can't be possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's with a single bond. Hmm, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So each of the two central carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, but each CH in the double bond can only have three substituents. So each of those carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. But that would make it a double bond between two carbons each bearing two COOCH3 groups, which would be impossible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps the actual structure is CH2-C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3)-CH2. No, that can't be right either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach this differently. Fumarate comes from fumaric acid, which is an (E) diacid. The diacid would have two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Another way: each of the two ends of the double bond have a COOCH3 group. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end. So the molecule would be CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not correct because that would imply a single bond. Oh, I'm getting stuck here. Let me just think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule can be divided by a plane into mirror images, then it's not chiral. If it can't, then it's chiral. So, looking at the structure, if the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if each of the two carbons in the double bond has the same groups, then the molecule is symmetric. So, if both carbons in the double bond have COOCH3 and another identical group, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, in that case, it wouldn't be chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. But I can't see how that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me look for the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that compounds 2 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But earlier, I thought 4 doesn't, but maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, but that doesn't make sense because that would imply an sp3 hybridized carbon with four substituents. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, which would imply a carbon connected to two COOCH3 groups, a CH2, and a double bond. But that's impossible because a carbon in a double bond can only have three substituents. So no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2. No, that's not correct because fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which is a four-carbon molecule with double bond in the middle.

So, I'm stuck on compound 4. Let me think about the options. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

If compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism, then the only compound that does is 2, but looking at the options, option D says 1 and 2. But I thought 1 doesn't. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

Let me re-examine compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each phenyl has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring is connected at 1, and has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Now, the question is whether this arrangement leads to optical isomerism.

I think that in such a structure, the two rings are symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents (nitro and ester) in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the option that includes only 2 is not present. Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

So the only option that includes 2 is A, D, and C.

But according to my analysis, only 2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options include only 2. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, are there any other compounds that might exhibit optical isomerism? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 actually has a chiral center. Let's imagine the structure: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a chiral center somewhere. Wait, perhaps the central carbon in the double bond is connected to different groups, making it a chiral center. But wait, in a double bond, the carbons are sp2 hybridized and don't have four different substituents. So they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are not identical. Wait, but in fumarate, they are identical. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but if the two groups are same on each carbon, then the molecule is symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if one end has a COOCH3 and the other end has a different group. But no, in fumarate, both ends are identical.

So, perhaps I was correct earlier, and only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But in the options, the only option with 2 is A, D, and C. None of them have only 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think: what if the structure of dimethyl fumarate has a central carbon that is a chiral center? For example, if the structure is such that the central carbon is connected to four different groups. Hmm, but fumarate is a diester, and the central carbons are in a double bond. So they're sp2 hybridized and can't be chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another possibility. Maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry but no chiral centers, making it not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, if only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer but not chiral. Because it's a trans diastereomer, so it's symmetrical, thus not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, that leaves only compound 2 as showing optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, the only option that includes 2 is A, D, and C. None of which include only 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, for the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. So, when looking at the two rings connected at position 1, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on each ring leads to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the nitro and ester groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, then the molecule would be chiral. Let me imagine the structure: each ring has a nitro and ester group. If the substituents are trans with respect to the connecting bond, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But if they are cis, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, but in the case of 6 and 2 positions, the substituents are meta on each ring. So if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta, then the arrangement is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should research the structures of these compounds. From what I remember, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Yes.
3. No.
4. No.

But then, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look back at the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Hmm, if only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, then perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Maybe it does have optical isomerism. Let's think again. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta. So for each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So, for the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to the connecting bond create asymmetry. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of the ring, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule being chiral.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that their positions relative to each other and the connecting bond create a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl group itself can have different configurations leading to optical isomerism. The biphenyl can have different diastereomers based on the rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. But that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. Wait, but in some cases, biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a form of chirality without a chiral center. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral due to the arrangement around the single bond.

Ah, this is a key point I might have missed. So axial chirality is a thing. For example, in biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, then it can exhibit optical isomerism. This is known as the biphenyl effect.

So, for compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Now, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta. So, for each ring, the substituents are across from each other. If the two rings are connected at position 1, and the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the overall molecule asymmetric, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents at 2 and 6. So, if each ring is identical, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But perhaps when the substituents are arranged in a certain way around the single bond, the molecule becomes chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, I'm not entirely sure about this.

But if I consider the possibility that compound 1 exhibits axial chirality, then it would show optical isomerism.

So, if compound 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, then the correct option would be D) 1 and 2.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. However, given the information, I think compound 2 definitely does, and if compound 1 has axial chirality, then option D would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think again: the correct answer likely includes compound 2 and perhaps 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is an ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. The dimethyl ester would have the same (E) configuration. Now, does this create a chiral center? No, because each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two identical groups. So, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the only compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 and perhaps 1, if it has axial chirality. So, option D (1 and 2) or option A (1,2,4).

But I'm not confident about compound 1. Alternatively, perhaps only compound 2 does, but since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about each compound again.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

This is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are nitro and methyl ester. Now, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face of the biphenyl, then the molecule would be chiral. Alternatively, if they are on opposite faces, the molecule may be symmetrical.

But without knowing the specific arrangement, it's hard to say. However, the question states that it's a case of isomerism, so perhaps compound 1 is chiral.

2. As before, definitely chiral.

3. Benzophenone: not chiral.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: not chiral.

So, if compounds 1 and 2 are chiral, then the correct option would be D) 1 and 2.

But I'm not entirely sure about compound 1. Another way: perhaps the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are such that the molecule has a chiral axis, making it chiral. So, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A (1,2,4), but that doesn't make sense because I thought 4 doesn't. Alternatively, it could be D, which includes 1 and 2.

But without being certain, I'll proceed with the analysis that compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, making option D the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for chirality, which requires the absence of a plane of symmetry and the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at positions 6 and carboxylate methyl esters at positions 2 on each phenyl ring. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. Since the substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring are not identical, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen atom (H). This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and is not a chiral center. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl group, making it achiral and incapable of optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on either side of the double bond are identical (two COOCH3 groups). This symmetry prevents chirality, and the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality in the biphenyl system.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism because they lack chirality.  

Thus, the compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.
