Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because any quantum state should have a norm of 1. Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so perhaps I need to find the normalization factor.

Wait, the first part is about measuring the probability in the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix is given as Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so the matrix is 2x2 because it has |up> and |down> as eigenstates. Let me write down what that matrix looks like.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So matrix A would be:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Hmm, this operator A. I remember that the eigenstates of such an operator are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction because the Pauli X matrix has similar properties. Because the Pauli matrices for spin in x-direction are [[0,1],[1,0]], but scaled by hbar/2 here. So perhaps A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually defined as σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we have A = (hbar/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the spin-up and spin-down states in the x-direction, often denoted as |+x> and |-x>.

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then find the average value of operator A.

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of S_z (the z-component of spin). So to find the probabilities in the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, I might need to express |alpha> in terms of these states.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenstates, then project |alpha> onto those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Wait, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, its eigenvalues are ± hbar/2 because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Let me think: the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σ_x |+x> = |+x>, and similarly for the other.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

To find the probabilities, I need to find the projection of |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates.

But first, I need to normalize |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, and it's proportional to that. So let me compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 because the inner product is <up| + <down| multiplied by the state. So |1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2)=2, and |2−i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right?

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The probability of each eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and the respective eigenstate.

So let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

< +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Multiplying these together, we get:

[ (1+i) + (2−i) ) ] / [ sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ]

Simplify numerator: (1+i +2 -i ) = 3. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait wait, wait. Because when you take the inner product, you have to compute each component. Let me write it again.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

The inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) ].

So that becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, because <up| up> is 1, same for down. So the inner product is ( (1+i) + (2 - i) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: 1+i +2 -i = 3. So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the modulus squared, so |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, that's one probability. Similarly, the probability of |-x> would be the inner product squared.

Wait, no. Wait, the other eigenstate is |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So let's compute <−x|alpha>.

Similarly, <−x|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2−i) ] / sqrt(7).

Compute the numerator: 1+i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

But wait, the inner product is a complex number. The probability is the modulus squared, so | (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14) |^2 = (1 +4 ) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428 and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. But looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to these numbers. So maybe option A is a candidate.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>.

Wait, I think I miscalculated. Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when I compute < +x | alpha >, it's (1+i + 2 -i ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, (1+i) is the coefficient of |up> in |alpha>, and (2 -i) is the coefficient for |down>.

So when you take the inner product with |+x>, which is (1/sqrt(2))(1,1) in the basis of |up>, |down>, you get (1+i)*1*1/sqrt(2) + (2 - i)*1 *1/sqrt(2) ) divided by sqrt(7).

Wait, no, when you take the inner product, you have to take the conjugate of the coefficients of |+x>, but I might have messed that up. Wait, no, < +x | is (1,1)/sqrt(2) because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is (1,1) . (1+i, 2−i) all over sqrt(2)*sqrt(7).

So that's ( (1+i) + (2−i) ) / sqrt(14) ) = (3) / sqrt(14).

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14), so the modulus squared is 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, for <−x | alpha >, it's ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(14) ) = ( (1+i -2 +i) ) / sqrt(14) ) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36. So that would match option A's first part, which lists 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, the first part of the question is to calculate the probabilities. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So the options might round these to two decimal places.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So that's the first part.

Next, the average value of operator A. The average value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute this expectation value.

So < A > = (hbar/2) * <alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

Because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So, let me compute <sigma_x> for |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i), (2−i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Now, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So sigma_x |alpha> would be the vector [ (2−i), (1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is the inner product of [ (1−i), (2+i) ] (because conjugate) with [ (2−i), (1+i) ] all divided by sqrt(7).

So compute (1−i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) all divided by 7.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2= -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i^2 = 2 + 2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) +3i = 1 + 3i.

Now sum the two terms: (1-3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So <sigma_x> = 2 /7.

Therefore, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

That matches option A's third value, which is hbar/7.

So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for <sigma_x>. Because I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0}].

So |alpha> is (1+i, 2−i) / sqrt(7).

So A|alpha> is [ (hbar/2)(2−i), (hbar/2)(1+i) ] / sqrt(7).

Taking the inner product with <alpha| (which is (1−i, 2+i) / sqrt(7) ):

So <alpha | A | alpha > is [ (1−i)(hbar/2)(2−i) + (2+i)(hbar/2)(1+i) ] /7.

Factor out hbar/2, gives (hbar/2) * [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] /7.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the same calculation applies.

Wait, let me compute (1−i)(2−i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2-3i -1 = 1-3i.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) + 2(i) +i(1) +i^2 = 2 + 2i +i -1 = 1+3i.

Adding those: 1-3i +1+3i = 2.

So again, 2/7 multiplied by hbar/2 → (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/7.

So that's correct.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357), and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

So that must be the correct answer.

The problem involves an electron in the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = hbar/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>
The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm is computed as:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|up\rangle + (2-i)|down\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A is given by:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|up\rangle + |down\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|up\rangle - |down\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring |+x> and |-x>
The probability of measuring |+x> is the square of the modulus of the inner product:

\[
\langle +x | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring |-x> is:

\[
\langle -x | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle alpha | A | alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting A = (hbar/2) σ_x and |alpha\rangle = [(1+i), (2-i)]^T / sqrt(7), we compute:

\[
\langle sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is hbar/7. This matches **Option A**.
