Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses directly matter here because the question is about elemental abundances, which are given using the EW method under LTE conditions.

Let me look at the given data. For Star_1, the [Si/Fe] ratio is 0.3 dex. That means the abundance of silicon relative to iron is higher in Star_1 than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Similarly, for Star_2, the [Mg/Si] ratio is 0.3 dex. Also, both stars have their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as 0, which suggests that their iron and magnesium abundances relative to hydrogen are the same as the Sun.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]1 is 0, then Fe/H1 is 1. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]2 is 0, so Mg/H2 is 1.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So the log of (nFe/nH) is 7.5 minus 12, which is -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) is -5, so nMg/nH is 10^-5.

So the Sun's Fe/H is 10^-4.5 and Mg/H is 10^-5. But wait, the stars have [Fe/H]=0, which means their Fe/H is the same as the Sun's. So Star_1's Fe is the same as the Sun's.

But how does this relate to the other elements? Let me think about the ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 is 0.3. So the abundance of Si relative to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's [X/Y] is log(nX/nY), so for Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3. So Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times the Sun's Si/Fe ratio.

But what is the Sun's Si/Fe ratio? Oh wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. Hmm. Maybe I can compute it from the given data. Oh, because the Sun's composition includes Fe and Mg, but not Si. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Wait, no, the ratio is (n_Si in Star_1) divided by (n_Si in Star_2). Let me think about how to compute each.

Let me think about the abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3. So Si/Fe = 10^0.3 * (Sun's Si/Fe).

But the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. Hmm, maybe I can compute it from other data. Because we have the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Wait, perhaps I can express Si in terms of Mg and other ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this using the given data step by step.

Let me try to write down all the given ratios.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe_1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

But wait, [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Oh no, wait, the definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3 → log( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Wait, but H is the same for all, or relative to H? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: since [Fe/H]1 is 0, that means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So, (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun) * (H_sun/H_1) ) → but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps (Fe/H)_1 = (n_Fe1 / n_H1) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 1, because [Fe/H] is 0.

So n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But I'm not sure if H varies between stars. Oh, I think when we talk about [X/H], we are comparing the number density of X relative to H in the star compared to the Sun. So, if [X/H] is 0, the number density of X relative to H is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, but the problem says the Sun's photospheric composition is 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and same for Mg. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly for Mg: log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

So, for the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

Similarly, n_Mg_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

Now, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). Hmm, but I don't know about the H density in the stars. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work with the ratios relative to H because the [X/H] is given.

But maybe I should express all the elements in terms of H.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) )=0.3 → n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But we don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. Wait, maybe we can find n_Si_sun from other data. Wait, the question gives Star_2's [Mg/Si] ratio. Let's see:

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]2 = 0.3 → log( (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun).

But Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

Hmm. But without knowing H in the stars, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe I can express everything in terms of the Sun's composition.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si in Star_1 relative to the Sun, and similarly for Star_2, then take the ratio.

Wait, let me think: for each star, find n_Si divided by n_Si_sun, and then take (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun) / (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun) ) = n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Yes, that makes sense. So the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun) divided by (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun) → which is (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

So if I can find (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun) and (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun), I can find their ratio.

But how?

Well, let's take Star_1 first.

We know [Si/Fe]1 =0.3. So,

log( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3

→ (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun)

But Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0 → n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun)

But also, in the Sun, n_Fe_sun is 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

So,

n_Fe1 = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) ) → 1e-4.5 * n_H1.

Wait, but how do I relate n_Si1 to n_Si_sun?

Hmm. Maybe I can express n_Si1 in terms of n_Fe1. Because from the [Si/Fe] ratio, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun from the solar Mg and Fe data, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can express n_Si in terms of Mg.

Wait, let's think about Star_2. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]2 =0.3.

So,

log( (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) = 0.3 → n_Mg2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun)

But Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

So,

n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun )

So,

( n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun) ) / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun )

Simplify:

(n_H2 / n_H_sun) / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (1 / n_Si_sun )

→ (n_H2 / n_H_sun ) = n_Si2 * (10^0.3) * (1 / n_Si_sun )

→ So n_Si2 = (n_H2 / n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )

But again, without knowing n_Si_sun, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the two stars through the Sun's composition. Let me think.

Wait, in the Sun, we don't have the [Si/H] given, but perhaps I can compute it from other data.

Wait, let me think. For the Sun, the number densities are given as:

log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → because 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 → -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? Oh, the question doesn't give that. Hmm. So maybe I can't find the exact value of nSi_sun in terms of H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratios in terms of H. Let's try for Star_1.

Star_1's [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → n_Si1 / n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 → because [Fe/H]1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 ) / n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si1 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) * n_Fe1

= (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) * (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 ) / n_H_sun )

→ The n_Fe_sun cancels:

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun.

So, n_Si1 / n_Si_sun = 10^0.3 * (n_H1 / n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

From [Mg/Si]2 =0.3 → (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun )

And [Mg/H]2=0 → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2.

So,

( (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2 ) / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun )

Cancel n_Mg_sun on both sides:

(n_H2 / n_H_sun ) / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 / n_Si_sun

→ n_Si2 = (n_H2 / n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )

So, n_Si2 / n_Si_sun = (n_H2 / n_H_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

Now, the ratio of the two stars' silicon atoms is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = [ (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun ) ] / [ (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun ) ].

Which is [10^0.3 * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) ] / [ (n_H2 / n_H_sun) / 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) ] * [10^0.3 * (n_H_sun / n_H2 ) ]

The n_H_sun cancels, so:

= (10^0.3)^2 * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

= 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Now, what is the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2? Hmm, photospheric composition is about number densities. For stars, the number density of hydrogen is proportional to the star's surface gravity and temperature, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if both stars are main-sequence, perhaps their H densities can be related to their masses.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen density (n_H) is the same for both stars. But that's a big assumption. Because for main-sequence stars, more massive stars have higher surface gravity, which would affect the scale of their atmospheres, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the H density is the same because they're both main-sequence stars and we're considering the photosphere, which is a thin layer. Hmm, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the ratio of H and treat it as 1.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the given data for the Sun is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, etc. So the Sun's H is in the photosphere, but for other stars, their H might be different.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that n_H1 and n_H2 are the same as the Sun's, or perhaps it's a ratio that can be determined.

Wait, another approach: When using the equivalent width (EW) method under LTE, the abundance is determined based on the star's atmospheric parameters (like temperature, gravity, etc.), but the problem here gives us [Fe/H] and other ratios, so perhaps the H density is accounted for in those values.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking about the ratio of Si relative to each other, not considering H. Wait, but without knowing the H densities, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the stars are similar to the Sun in their H density, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to realize that n_H is the same for both stars, because they have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] equal to 0, which implies their Fe and Mg are scaled to H as in the Sun.

Wait, if [Fe/H] is 0, that means (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the stars' H densities are the same as the Sun's. If that's the case, then n_H1 = n_H_sun and n_H2 = n_H_sun. Then,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^0.6 * (1/1) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. That would correspond to option A) ~3.9.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Because in reality, more massive stars have lower surface gravity, which might affect the scale height and the number density in the photosphere. But perhaps the problem is expecting us to assume n_H is the same for both stars, or that the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the fact that [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that the overall metallicity is the same as the Sun, meaning that n_H is same.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is a logarithmic measure. So, if [Fe/H] is 0, (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun.

But (Fe/H)_star = (n_Fe1 / n_H1) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun )

Which equals 1 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2.

So, if n_H1 and n_H2 are the same as the Sun's, then n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun and n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun.

But if n_H1 and n_H2 are different, then n_Fe1 and n_Mg2 could be different.

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't proceed. So perhaps the question expects us to assume that the H density is the same for both stars.

Assuming that, n_H1 =n_H_sun, n_H2 =n_H_sun.

Then, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98 → approximately 4, which matches option A.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the problem is using the fact that both stars have [Fe/H] =0 and [Mg/H]=0, implying that their overall metallicity (Fe and Mg) relative to H is the same as the Sun. But silicon's abundance relative to H isn't given, but is it possible to find it from the given data?

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 =0.3. So, (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Fe/H)_1 is 0 → Fe/H = (Fe/H)_sun → Fe is same relative to H.

So, (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun *10^0.3.

But (Si/Fe)_sun is (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) → which is (n_Si_sun / (1e-4.5 * n_H_sun )) ) / (1e-4.5 * n_H_sun / n_H_sun ) ) → Wait, n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

Wait, n_Si_sun is not given. So I can't compute that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's recap.

The question wants the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars: n_Si1 /n_Si2.

From earlier, I have:

n_Si1 =10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun )

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H2 ) / (1e0.3 * n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H1 / n_H_sun ] / [ (n_Si_sun * n_H2 )/(1e0.3 * n_H_sun ) ]

Simplify:

= [10^0.3 * n_H1 ] / [ (n_H2 )/(1e0.3 ) ]

= (10^0.3 * n_H1 ) * (1e0.3 ) / n_H2 )

= 10^(0.3 +0.3) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 10^0.6 * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

So the ratio is 10^0.6 times (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But I don't know n_H1 and n_H2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps n_H1 and n_H2 can be determined from the stars' masses. Stars with higher masses typically have higher temperatures and lower surface gravities. Lower surface gravity leads to lower number density in the photosphere. Surface gravity g is proportional to mass / radius^2. But I don't have the radius of the stars, so this might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H density is same for both stars, which would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98 → ~4, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a simpler approach.

Wait, another approach: The [Fe/H] is 0 for both stars, which implies that Fe abundance is same as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H] is 0 for Star_2, so Mg is same as the Sun.

So, for Star_1, the [Si/Fe] is 0.3 → more Si relative to Fe. Since Fe is same as Sun, the Si abundance is higher.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3 → more Mg relative to Si. Since Mg is same as Sun, the Si is lower than in the Sun.

So, Star_1 has more Si than the Sun, Star_2 has less Si than the Sun. So the ratio of their Si would be (higher) divided by (lower), which leads to a number greater than 1.

Looking at the options, options A and B are above 1, C and D are below.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave about 4, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the Sun's, but I'm not sure.

I think the correct approach here is to compute n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^0.6 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1/n_H2, perhaps the problem expects us to set it to 1, leading to the answer A) ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate n_H1 and n_H2 through the stars' masses and surface gravities. Let's think about that.

The number density n is proportional to the surface gravity g divided by the temperature T^(2/3), perhaps? Or something along those lines. Wait, the scale height H is proportional to T/(g). So the number density in the photosphere depends on the surface gravity and temperature.

But without knowing the temperature and gravity of each star, it's impossible to compute n_H1 and n_H2. So perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H number density is same for both stars, which is a common assumption in such problems.

So, with that assumption, n_H1/n_H2 =1, and the ratio becomes 10^0.6 ≈3.98 → ~4, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and apply the relationships between the elements relative to hydrogen.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex → \( n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si_sun}} / n_{\text{Fe_sun}}) \).
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{Fe_sun}} / n_{\text{H_sun}} \), implying \( n_{\text{Fe1}} = n_{\text{Fe_sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{H_sun}}) \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex → \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg_sun}} / n_{\text{Si_sun}}) \).
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{Mg_sun}} / n_{\text{H_sun}} \), implying \( n_{\text{Mg2}} = n_{\text{Mg_sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H2}} / n_{\text{H_sun}}) \).

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{H2}}}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data on the hydrogen number density (\( n_{\text{H1}} \) and \( n_{\text{H2}} \)) in the stars. To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen density is the same for both stars (\( n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{H2}} = 1 \)), which is a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.

#### Calculation:
With \( n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{H2}} = 1 \), the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is **~3.9**, corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A
