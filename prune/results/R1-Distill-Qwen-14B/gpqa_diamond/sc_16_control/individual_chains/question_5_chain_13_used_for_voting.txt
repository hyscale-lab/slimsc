Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Let me read through the problem again and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Okay, so the first thing I remember is that for a quantum operator, the eigenvectors are the states that are only scaled by the operator, and the eigenvalues are the scaling factors. So, the eigenvector |v> should satisfy P|v> = (ħ/2)|v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. The operator is given as P, but in quantum mechanics, spin operators are usually represented as components like Sx, Sy, Sz. Oh wait, the problem says the operator is P, which I guess is similar to the spin operator. So each component P_x, P_y, P_z is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm. The user provided expressions for each component:
- Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0 1], second row [1 0].
- Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0 -i], second row [i 0].
- Pz is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [1 0], second row [0 -1].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles (like the muon) are usually represented by the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So maybe Px, Py, Pz are each (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz respectively.

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. That matches the given components, so yes, P is the spin operator here.

Now, the operator we're considering is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right! The general spin operator in an arbitrary direction is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components.

Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, if it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be 0, so the direction is along θ from the z-axis towards x.

So the operator P along n would be P·n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z.

But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the problem says the operator is P along n, so that's the operator whose eigenvectors we're considering. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|v> = (+ħ/2)|v>.

Hmm. So the operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues for P·n would be ±ħ/2, just like for any component of spin. So the eigenvectors correspond to spin up or down along the direction n.

So I'm looking for the eigenvector of P·n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But the eigenvectors are typically found by solving (P·n - λ I)|v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is ħ/2.

Let me write this out. Let's denote the direction vector as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle. Since it's in the x-z plane, phi is 0.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P·n is:

n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix.

So, P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
            [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute each element:

Top-left element: (sinθ * 0 * ħ/2) + (cosθ * 1 * ħ/2) → (ħ/2) cosθ.

Top-right: (sinθ * 1 * ħ/2) → (ħ/2) sinθ.

Bottom-left: same as top-right because of the structure of σx and σz → (ħ/2) sinθ.

Bottom-right: (sinθ * 0 * ħ/2) + (cosθ * (-1) * ħ/2) → -(ħ/2) cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ = ħ/2.

Wait, no, the operator is (P·n) = λ |v> ?

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. So for the eigenvalue λ = ħ/2, the equation becomes:

(P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So let me compute the matrix (P·n - (ħ/2) I).

Each element is subtracted by (ħ/2) on the diagonal.

So the matrix becomes:

Top-left: (ħ/2) cosθ - (ħ/2) = (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1).

Top-right: (ħ/2) sinθ.

Bottom-left: (ħ/2) sinθ.

Bottom-right: -(ħ/2) cosθ - (ħ/2) = -(ħ/2)(cosθ + 1).

So the matrix is:

[ (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)   (ħ/2) sinθ ]
[ (ħ/2) sinθ        -(ħ/2)(cosθ + 1) ]

Hmm, a bit messy, but perhaps we can factor ħ/2 out.

Let me factor out (ħ/2) from each element:

(ħ/2) * [ [ (cosθ - 1), sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -(cosθ + 1) ] ]

So the equation is this matrix multiplied by the vector (a, b) equals zero.

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Since the vector (a, b) can't be zero, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

But wait, let me write the two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

We can solve for a and b.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But cosθ -1 is -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So let me try to express this in terms of half-angles.

Wait, using trigonometric identities:

cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So substituting into equation 1:

( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) a + (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) b = 0
Divide both sides by 2 sin(θ/2) [assuming sin(θ/2) ≠ 0, which would be the case unless θ=0, which is a trivial direction along z-axis]:

-sin(θ/2) a + cos(θ/2) b = 0
→ -sin(θ/2) a = - cos(θ/2) b
Wait, no, wait: Wait, after dividing by 2 sin(θ/2), the equation becomes:

-sin(θ/2) a + cos(θ/2) b = 0

So,

-sin(θ/2) a + cos(θ/2) b =0 → a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Hmm. So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = (cot(theta/2) * b, b) = b (cot(theta/2), 1)

But we can choose b to be 1 for simplicity, so the vector is (cot(theta/2), 1). But we need to normalize it.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ratio a/b = cot(theta/2), so a = cot(theta/2) b.

Wait, but wait, let me check equation 2. Let's substitute a = cot(theta/2) b into equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Substitute a:
sinθ (cot(theta/2) b) - (cosθ +1) b =0

Factor out b:
[ sinθ cot(theta/2) - (cosθ +1) ] * b =0

So if b is not zero, the expression in brackets must be zero.

Compute sinθ cot(theta/2):

We know that cot(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)] / [sin(theta/2)].

And sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

sin(theta) cot(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] = 2 cos²(theta/2).

Now, cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2), because using the identity 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So substituting back, the expression becomes:

[ 2 cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) ] = 0. So yes, equation 2 is satisfied. Thus, any vector proportional to (cot(theta/2), 1) is an eigenvector, provided theta is not 0 or pi.

Wait, but wait, for theta=0, cos(theta)=1, sin(theta)=0.

In that case, the direction is along +z. Let's see what the eigenvector would be.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so perhaps theta can be any angle except 0 or pi.

So, the eigenvector is (cot(theta/2), 1). But we need to normalize it.

Compute the normalization factor. The vector is (a, b) = (cot(theta/2), 1). Let me compute the magnitude squared:

a^2 + b^2 = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) → since 1 + cot²x = csc²x.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

Wait, no: 1/sqrt( a^2 + b^2 ) → 1 / sqrt(csc^2(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

Simplify each component:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So first component: [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

Second component: sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), right?

Wait, but wait, that's only if we take the positive sqrt, I think. Because when you normalize, you can have a positive or negative factor, but the eigenvector can be multiplied by any non-zero scalar. So let's just take the positive normalization.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options provided:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, why are the options involving hbar? Because the eigenvector is a vector in a Hilbert space, and it's normalized, so its components should be dimensionless (as spinors). So any option with hbar in them would have incorrect dimensions, perhaps.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement again, the options include terms with hbar multiplied by the components. Hmm. That's a bit confusing because eigenvectors are typically dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator P has components like (ħ/2) multiplied by Pauli matrices. But when finding eigenvectors, we're looking for vectors |v> such that P·n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But the eigenvectors are for the operator, which includes ħ. So the eigenvector is a spinor, which is a vector in a 2D complex space, and its components are just numbers (complex numbers), not involving units like ħ.

So the options that have hbar in them might be incorrect because they have units. So looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Hmm. If the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), then option C matches.

But wait, I should double-check if I made any mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. So after solving, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the problem says the operator is P along n. So the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector should depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but what if the direction is along x, theta=90 degrees. Then theta/2 is 45 degrees, and the eigenvector would be (cos(45), sin(45)) = (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2).

That makes sense because the eigenstate for Sx being ħ/2 is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

So in this case, option C would correctly give that, since cos(45) and sin(45) are both sqrt(2)/2.

But wait, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which, for theta=90 degrees, gives (cos(45), sin(45)), which is correct.

But wait, the problem says that the operator is P along n. So for n along x (theta=90), the eigenvector (spin up) is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is (cos 45, sin 45), which matches option C.

So why are the other options there?

Option B looks like spherical coordinates in terms of theta and phi, but since our phi is zero (since the direction is in x-z plane), it's (cos(theta), sin(theta)).

But wait, that's not the same as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm. So perhaps option C is the correct normalized eigenvector.

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly what I derived. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let's think again. The eigenvector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) is not normalized in all cases. Wait, the magnitude is sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented by a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

Substituting the given components of $\vec{P}$ and the direction $\vec{n}$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right]
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. This simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the operator gives:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Factoring out $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the equations to solve for the eigenvector $(a, b)$ are:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the equations simplify to:

\[
-\sin(\theta/2)a + \cos(\theta/2)b = 0, \quad \sin(\theta/2)a - \cos(\theta/2)b = 0
\]

From the first equation, $a = \cot(\theta/2)b$. Substituting into the second equation confirms the solution. The eigenvector is proportional to $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. Normalizing this vector, we find:

\[
\text{Normalized eigenvector} = \left( \cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2) \right)
\]

This matches option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors.
- **Option B** does not match the derived eigenvector and appears unrelated to the problem.
- **Option D** incorrectly includes $\hbar$ and additional factors, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
