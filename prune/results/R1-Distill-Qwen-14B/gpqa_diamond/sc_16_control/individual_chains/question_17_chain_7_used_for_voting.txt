Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. It says, what's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion where EDTA is acting as a ligand. The problem is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But some of that might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, the K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number. That suggests that the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, K is the formation constant. Oh right, formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

So, the problem is about the dissociation of the complex. Let me think about the equilibrium. The initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Let me denote the change as x. So, when some of it dissociates, the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each increase by x (assuming stoichiometry 1:1).

So the equilibrium would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x should be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02)

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

So plugging into Kf:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, so 0.02 / x² = 5e10. I need to solve for x.

Rearranging: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-6 / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-16 = 4e-17? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 5e10 is 5 times 10^10. So 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2)/(5e12) ) = 4e-13 / 10? Wait no, wait 2/(5e12) is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, 2e-2 is 0.02, divided by 5e10 is (0.02)/(5e10) = 0.02/(5 * 1e10) )= (0.02/5) * 1e-10 )= 0.004 * 1e-10 = 4e-13. So x² is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*10^-13, so sqrt is 2*10^-6.5? Because sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-6.5), which is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, because 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.3e-7. So [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer would be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate.

Given Kf = 5e10.

We have [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So Kf = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

So x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7. So yes, C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is initially 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions at equilibrium. At equilibrium:
- \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \)),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
