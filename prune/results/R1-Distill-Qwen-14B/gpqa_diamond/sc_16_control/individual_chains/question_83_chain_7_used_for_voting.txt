Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration changes, which affects the pH. Then, during titration, adding a strong base like NaOH will neutralize some of the acid. Let me break this down.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. That makes the total volume 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be concentration times volume, right? So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, volume in liters. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

After diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, I need to figure out the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001, as calculated earlier. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

I think for the 25% point, the solution is a buffer solution because some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Let me calculate the moles of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- at this point. Initially, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. Adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH: moles of NaOH added = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of CH3COOH, moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by the same amount.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of acetate = 0.00025.

Now, the total volume is the original 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. Acetate concentration is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, 1.85e-5. The log of 1.85 is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 ). Let's compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. The log of 0.333 is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Hmm, so approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D's first value is 4.57, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Let me compute the ratio precisely. 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3, which is approximately 0.3333. So the log of 1/3 is indeed about -0.477. So pH is 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256, which is around 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The moles of NaOH added at equivalence point are 0.001, as calculated before. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (needed for equivalence) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is a weak base. It will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

But wait, Kb is very small, so the hydrolysis won't produce a lot of OH- ions. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Changes: -x, +x, +x. So the expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 M. Then, pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514.

Wait, but wait. That's about 8.51, which is close to 8.52. So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake here? Because I thought the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titration would be greater than 7. So 8.52 makes sense. But what about the options? Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52. So that's what I got.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. At the equivalence point, would the solution be a solution of sodium acetate, which is indeed a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it's a basic solution.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the pH at equivalence point can be calculated by considering the hydrolysis of acetate ions. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the Kb or the calculation steps.

Let me recalculate the Kb. Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Yeah, that's correct.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. [OH-] = 3.29e-6. pOH = -log(3.29e-6) = around 5.486. pH = 8.514. So about 8.51, which rounds to 8.51 or 8.52.

So the first value is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, in the first part, maybe I should recheck the calculations. Let me recount the volumes and moles again.

Dilution step: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 mL, so 0.04 L, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Titration: 25% of equivalence point. Equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001. So NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. At 0.1 M, volume is 0.01 L =10 mL. 25% is 2.5 mL NaOH.

So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Neutralizes 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

After reaction, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 mL (original) + 2.5 mL (NaOH) =42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = pKa + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333333. Log(1/3) is about -0.4771. So pH = 4.733 -0.4771 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

So the first pH is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at the options again. Option D: 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, why would someone get a lower pH at equivalence point? Maybe if they thought the solution is acidic, but no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps a mistake in considering the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps at the equivalence point I should be considering buffer. No, at the equivalence point, all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait, another possibility: when I calculated the pH at equivalence, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration.

Wait, when I added 10 mL of NaOH to 40 mL, that's 50 mL total. So moles of acetate is 0.001, volume 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me recalculate the Kb and the x.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.4054e-10.

So Kb = 5.4054e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02 =5.4054e-10.

x²=5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x= sqrt(1.08108e-11) = approximately 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let's compute that more accurately.

Log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) = 0.5169 -6 = -5.4831. So pOH is 5.4831. pH = 14-5.4831=8.5169, approximately 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another option, D, has the first pH as 4.57. How would someone get that?

Maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ratio. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation uses [base]/[acid]. So it's [A-]/[HA]. So 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

So log(0.333) is -0.477. pKa is ~4.733. So 4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256. So 4.26 is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the initial dilution was done incorrectly. Let me recheck.

Original volume: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

So initial calculations are correct. So the first pH is 4.26, second is 8.52. So option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option D is 4.57;6.92. Hmm, maybe the problem is that I considered the solution after adding 2.5 mL, but perhaps I should have considered the initial solution after dilution, before any titration.

Wait, no, the question is about the pH at 25% titration, meaning that 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So my approach was correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting to a total volume of \(40 \, \text{cm}^3\) (\(0.04 \, \text{L}\)), the new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, \(2.5 \, \text{cm}^3\) of \(0.1 \, \text{M}\) NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes \(0.00025 \, \text{mol}\) of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume after adding \(2.5 \, \text{cm}^3\) of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Therefore:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all \(0.001 \, \text{mol}\) of acetic acid has been neutralized, forming \(0.001 \, \text{mol}\) of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Using the approximation \(K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}\), where \(x = [\text{OH}^-]\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, \([\text{OH}^-] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), and the pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \(8.52\). These values correspond to **Option A**.

Answer: A
