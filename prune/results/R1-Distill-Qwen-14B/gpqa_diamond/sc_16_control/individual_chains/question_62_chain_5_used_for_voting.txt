Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure of the target. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Then, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane at position 1. So, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a branch that's a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2OH group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl (triple bond) group attached. The structure is cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

I need to figure out the reactions that would transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target. Let's think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps I should consider adding a substituent to the triple bond. Ethynyl groups can undergo various reactions. For example, alkyne additions, like hydrohalogenation or hydration, or perhaps coupling reactions.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So maybe I need to introduce some kind of ring expansion or form a new ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized to form an aldehyde. But wait, the starting material is an alkyne. Maybe the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde somehow.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde on the cyclohexane. So the main ring has an aldehyde group. How do I get that from an ethynyl group?

I think about oxidation. Maybe the triple bond can be oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a cyanide addition followed by hydrolysis could form an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone, and then the ketone undergoes some reaction, like a Claisen or aldol condensation? Not sure.

Alternatively, considering the target structure, I see that the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. That suggests that maybe there's a substitution or some ring-opening involved.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be used to form a ring. For example, using a metal like lithium to form a diradical, or perhaps using a diene in some cycloaddition? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane could undergo a hydration reaction to form a cyclohexanol derivative. But wait, the triple bond would typically add water in a process like acid-catalyzed hydration to form a ketone. So if I have ethynylcyclohexane, adding H2O with some catalyst would give cyclohexanone.

But wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. Wait, no, wait, the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2- group? Or is it cyclohexane attached directly to the triple bond? Let me clarify: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

So if I perform an acid-catalyzed hydration, like using HgSO4 and H2SO4, with H2O, that would add water across the triple bond. The triple bond is between the cyclohexane's carbon and the other carbon. So the hydration would form a ketone, right? Because ethynyl groups on a ring upon hydration would give a cyclohexanone. But wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡C-CH2? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So when you add water, you get an alcohol. Wait, no, in the case of an alkyne like ethynyl, adding water would give an enol which tautomerizes to a ketone. So perhaps cyclohexanone would be formed.

But the target molecule has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. Hmm, so if I have cyclohexanone, how do I get to an aldehyde?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group in a different way. For example, Oxymercuration or some other addition could form an alcohol, which then oxidizes to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the target's aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, so maybe the triple bond is on a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is part of a side chain.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about the overall synthesis steps.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has an aldehyde group at position 1, and at the same position, there's a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexanol group (cyclohexyl-OH-CH2-).

Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So that substituent is a CH2 group where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl (OH) and the other by a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So the substituent is a CH2OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is a -(CH2)OH-cyclohexyl group attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, no, perhaps I should draw this. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine.

So the main cyclohexane has at position 1 a CH2 group. This CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group (so the CH2 is -CH2-OH and also -CH2-cyclohexyl). Wait, that can't be, because a CH2 group can have at most two substituents besides the two hydrogens. Oh wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So it's a CH2 group attached to the main cyclohexane, and that CH2 has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the structure is:

Main ring: cyclohexane with an aldehyde group (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group. This CH2 group is connected to a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Wait, but a CH2 group can't have three substituents. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a CH group, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the name.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So the substituent is -(CH2OH)-cyclohexyl. No, that can't be right because the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So the substituent is a methyl group (-CH2-) where one hydrogen is replaced by hydroxyl and the other by cyclohexyl. Wait, but that would imply a CH2 group with two substituents, which isn't possible. Wait, perhaps it's a CH group with two substituents and a hydrogen. So the substituent is a CH group attached to the main ring, with one substituent being a cyclohexyl group and the other a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, that makes more sense. So the substituent is a CH with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, maybe I should think about the reagents. Let's look at the options.

Each option has a sequence of reagents. Let's go through them.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, that looks like two step 3s. Probably a typo, perhaps it's a Ba(OH)2 step then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Hmm. Let me think about NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation, especially in alkyne chemistry. It can also be used in the formation of Grignard reagents. When you have a terminal alkyne, NaNH2 can deprotonate it, making it a strong base. Then, when you add methyl chloride, perhaps it's an alkylation. So maybe the ethynyl group is getting alkylated.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has the structure cyclohexane-CC≡CH. Treating with NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne, making it a strong base, which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in an alkylation. So the alkyne would become CH2Cl attached to the cyclohexane? Wait, no, wait. The alkyne is -C≡C-H. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give -C≡C^- Na^+. Then adding CH3Cl (methyl chloride) would alkylate, giving -C≡C-CH3. So the product would be 1-propynylcyclohexane? Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl would give 1-methyl-1-cyclohexenyl something?

Wait, wait. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CC≡CH. When treated with NaNH2, it deprotonates to cyclohexane-CC≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate, giving cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH3. That would be 1-propynylcyclohexane, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, another possibility is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a method to form a new carbon-carbon bond. So the NaNH2 and methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the triple bond. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So maybe it's more of an alkyne alkylation.

So after step 1, the alkyne becomes a longer alkyne. So that could set up for another reaction.

Looking at option C's step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing the triple bond to a single bond. So if the alkyne is alkylated to a longer chain, then hydrogenated, it would become a single bond. Let's say we have a longer alkyne, like -C≡C-CH2-CH3, but wait, earlier step would have added a methyl group, so maybe it's -C≡C-CH2CH3, but no, the first step was adding a methyl to the triple bond, perhaps making it -C≡C-CH3.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each reagent step.

Let me outline the possible steps.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. As discussed, likely alkylation to make cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So CC≡C-CH3 would become CH2CH2CH3? Wait, but hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is C≡C. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making a single bond. So cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, that would make a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't fit the target molecule. The target has a cyclohexane with substituents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a ketone, which then undergoes some kind of ring expansion or aldol reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an epoxide or another functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible steps each option suggests.

Looking at option D: steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and liquid NH3, then O3 and (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base; methanol would be a source of methyl groups. So perhaps the alkyne is alkylated with methanol, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, it's a deprotonation followed by a substitution. Hmm.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol might lead to a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Step 2 in option D is Li and liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for Birch reduction or for alkyne additions, like in the formation of alkenes from alkynes through deprotonation and alkylation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So an aldehyde attached to the cyclohexane. How can we get an aldehyde from an alkyne?

One way is to hydroxylate the alkyne to a ketone and then reduce it to an aldehyde, but that might not be straightforward.

Wait, another approach: the alkyne can be converted into a carboxylic acid, which can then be reduced to an aldehyde. But that might involve more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, using O3 (ozone) for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a triple bond can break it into carbonyl groups. So if I have an alkyne, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (C≡CH). Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would typically give a ketone and a carboxylic acid, but under certain conditions, maybe just a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that fit into the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some hydration and then further oxidized.

Wait, another idea: the target's substituent has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. That suggests it may have come from an epoxide ring-opening or a Grignard addition.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then subjected to a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a new ring. For example, using a Simmons-Smith reaction to add a cyclopropane, but that's probably not relevant here.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which likely alkylates the alkyne, making it longer. Step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions, maybe for epoxidation or something else. The H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O sounds like a hydration condition, perhaps for a triple bond.

Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated, so step 3 might not do anything. Maybe step 3 is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or something else. Not sure.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, perhaps alkylating the alkyne to a longer chain. Step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a condition for deprotonating alkynes and adding groups. For example, in the formation of alkenes via deprotonation and alkylation. Step 3 is O3 and H2O, which would cleave any double bonds. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which might be for workup after ozonolysis.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, same as A. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup for ozonolysis. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could be for elimination or oxidation.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, which could be a way to add a methyl group via substitution or perhaps a Grignard-like reaction. Step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which again is a strong base. Step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive cleavage. Step 4 is NH4OH, for workup.

Hmm. Let's think about how each sequence could lead to the target.

The target has an aldehyde group. Where would that come from? Perhaps from ozonolysis of a triple bond. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would break it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a mono-substituted alkyne. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would give a ketone and a carboxylic acid. For example, R-C≡CH would become R-C=O and HOOC-R' (but I'm not sure about the exact products).

Alternatively, maybe ozonolysis is used in a different way, like cleaving the triple bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the aldehyde is on the main cyclohexane, while the substituent is a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the triple bond is being cleaved to form the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diketone, which then undergoes some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated to make a longer chain, then hydrogenated to a single bond, and then ozonolyzed to form the aldehyde.

Wait, let's think about that. If I have ethynylcyclohexane, and I alkylate it with methyl chloride to get a longer alkyne, then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain attached to the cyclohexane. Then, ozonolysis would break that into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure if that would give the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to some dihydroxylation, but that seems off track.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2OH group. So perhaps that's an epoxide ring-opening, where the epoxide is opened by a nucleophile to form an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from a Grignard addition. If the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then treated with a Grignard reagent, which adds a cyclohexyl group, perhaps leading to the CH2OH group after some steps.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack. For example, after forming an aldehyde, perhaps adding a Grignard reagent which then is hydrolyzed to form the alcohol.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer (maybe -C≡C-CH3).

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CC≡CH. After alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would turn the triple bond into a single bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So that's a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Then step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a single bond? No, ozonolysis is for double or triple bonds. Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is gone. So O3 wouldn't react. Hmm, that's a problem. So step 3 in option C wouldn't do anything. So option C might not be correct.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer, then H2/Pd → triple to single, then Ba(OH)2 (maybe elimination), then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O (hydration). Wait, but after the triple bond is hydrogenated, I don't see how Ba(OH)2 would help. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Could it form an epoxide? Not sure.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is for deprotonating the alkyne and then quenching with methanol, leading to a ketone. Or perhaps it's a way to form a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → alkylation, then Li and NH3 → maybe deprotonation and alkyne addition, then O3 and H2O → cleavage, then NH4OH.

Wait, let me think about option B.

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 + ethyl chloride. Alkyne is deprotonated, then reacts with ethyl chloride, adding an ethyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CC≡CH. Alkylation would add an ethyl group to the triple bond, making cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for deprotonating alkynes. Perhaps this is a method to form a diradical or to add more groups. Or perhaps it's a way to insert a group into the triple bond. Alternatively, it could hydrogenate the triple bond to a trans-alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: using Li in NH3 can lead to the formation of a metal acetylide. Then, perhaps adding another group. But I'm not sure.

Step 3 is O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave any double or triple bonds into carbonyls. So if after step 2, we have a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for workup after ozonolysis.

But how does this get us to the target molecule?

Hmm. Perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then made into an alkene, which is then cleaved via ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

Wait, another possibility: after alkylating the alkyne, step 2 could be a deprotonation and alkyne insertion. Then, ozonolysis would break the alkyne into two carbonyls. Let's see: the alkyne would be R-C≡C-R', and ozonolysis would form R-C=O and R'-C=O.

Wait, if the alkyne is ethylated, then ozonolysis would give two ketones or a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, which is a carbonyl group with one R group. So maybe the alkyne after alkylation and ozonolysis would result in an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, which then is used to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, but that doesn't seem to lead directly to the target. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about what each reagent does and how it could build the target.

Target has:

- Aldehyde group on cyclohexane.

- At the same position, a substituent: CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think: if the main ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), adding a Grignard reagent would add an organometallic to it, forming an alcohol after protonation. But where would the cyclohexyl group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition or a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes a Claisen or aldol reaction to form a new carbon chain, which is then functionalized.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into an epoxide, which is then opened to form an alcohol.

Wait, another angle: the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. That looks like a protection and deprotection scenario, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Could this be a way to form a ketone? Or perhaps a Grignard reaction? If the alkyne is deprotonated and then quenched with methanol, maybe it forms a ketone. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that NaNH2 and MeOH might lead to the formation of a methyl ketone. For example, deprotonating the alkyne and then adding a methyl group via substitution. Or perhaps it's a way to form a propargyl alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe NaNH2 is used to deprotonate the alkyne and then methanol acts as an electrophile, leading to an alkylation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can then be used in further reactions.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the target's substituent. It's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. That suggests that perhaps a cyclohexane ring is being attached via a CH2OH group. So maybe a ring-opening or a substitution is involved.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack on an electrophilic group. For example, if there's an epoxide, the hydroxyl group could attack it, leading to ring opening and forming a new bond.

But I'm not sure. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for the aldehyde group in the target. How can we form an aldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane?

One method could be to perform ozonolysis on the alkyne. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would produce a ketone and a carboxylic acid. For example, R-C≡CH would give R-C=O and HOOC-R'. But in this case, R is cyclohexyl, so ozonolysis would give cyclohexanone and formic acid (if R' is H). But the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone.

Wait, but maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via another method, such as hydration. For example, hydration of the triple bond would give a ketone, which can then be reduced to an aldehyde. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which can then be oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but that would require multiple steps and reagents. Let me check the options.

Looking at option C, step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond (so no triple bond anymore).

3. Ozonolysis wouldn't react because there's no double or triple bond.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So option C's step 3 wouldn't do anything.

Looking at option B: step 3 is O3 and H2O. So if after step 2, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, step 2 in option B is Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base. Maybe it's used to form a trans-alkene via deprotonation and alkyne insertion.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene using Li and NH3, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

So let's outline for option B:

Ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: alkylated with ethyl chloride via NaNH2, making a longer alkyne (cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH2CH3).

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → deprotonates the alkyne, perhaps forming a metal acetylide, which upon workup forms a trans-alkene. So the triple bond becomes a trans-alkene, giving cyclohexane-CH2CH2- with trans double bond? Wait, no, the triple bond would become a trans-alkene.

Wait, but Li in NH3 is more commonly used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating alkynes to form acetylides, which can then react with other electrophiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via this step.

Then, step 3: O3 and H2O → ozonolysis of the trans-alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, if the starting material after step 2 is a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. If the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option B is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one logically leads to the target.

The target has an aldehyde group. So somewhere in the process, an aldehyde must be formed. The only reagents that can form aldehydes are those that break triple bonds into carbonyls, like ozonolysis or certain reductions.

Looking at the options, option B and D have ozonolysis steps.

Option B: step 3 is O3 and H2O, which would cleave double bonds into carbonyls.

Option D: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidizing.

So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

But how would the molecule have a double bond after step 2 in option B?

Wait, step 2 in B is Li and liquid NH3. Could that lead to the formation of a double bond? For example, deprotonating the alkyne and then adding another group to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation followed by a reaction that forms a double bond. For instance, in the presence of a base, the alkyne could form a trans-alkene.

Wait, another possibility is that the alkyne is converted into an alkene via deprotonation and alkylation, leading to a new double bond.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then subjected to a reduction that forms a double bond.

Wait, but in option B, step 2 is Li and NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used to form a trans-alkene via a deprotonation and elimination.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond (like in option C), but that doesn't set up for an ozonolysis step.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall process.

The target molecule has two main features: an aldehyde on cyclohexane and a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl substituent.

So perhaps the process involves:

1. Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group, which becomes the aldehyde.

2. Introduce the substituent via a Grignard addition or similar.

But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can then undergo some kind of ring-opening or addition.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to a 1,2-addition to form a ketone, which then undergoes a nucleophilic attack by a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the correct sequence.

Wait, the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. That suggests the presence of an alcohol group. Perhaps this comes from an epoxide ring-opening. So, if there's an epoxide, adding a nucleophile like water would open it, forming an alcohol.

But how would the epoxide form? Maybe from an alkene via epoxidation.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to a longer alkyne.

2. The alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene.

3. The alkene is epoxidized.

4. The epoxide is opened by a nucleophile to form the alcohol.

But I don't see epoxidation reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is formed via some other method, but again, I'm not seeing the reagents.

Wait, let's think of each option's steps again.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and NH3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

If after step 1, the alkyne is converted into a ketone (e.g., via hydration), then step 2 could add a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard reagent. But I don't see Grignard reagents in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the Li and NH3 is for deprotonation and alkyne insertion.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group, which upon protonation gives the CH2-cyclohexyl group. Then, oxidation would give the OH group. But I don't see an oxidation step in option D.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress, but perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, in option C, step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes and ketones without further oxidation. So if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But how would the molecule have a double bond after step 2 in option C?

Step 2 in C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. So if the molecule after step 1 is an alkyne, step 2 would hydrogenate it to a single bond, making it an alkane. Then, step 3 would have nothing to react with. So option C's step 3 wouldn't do anything, making it an incorrect sequence.

So that leaves options A, B, D.

Option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2 and then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then, H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O sounds like acid-catalyzed hydration. But I'm not sure how that would form the target.

Option B: step 3 is O3 and H2O. So if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. Step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for workup, perhaps protonating carbonyls.

But how does this get to the target?

Wait, let's imagine:

Step 1 in B: ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated with ethyl chloride, perhaps becoming cyclohexane-CC≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → converts the triple bond into a trans-alkene, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2CH2-CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it forms a cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is deprotonating the alkyne and inserting a group to form a double bond. For example, converting the triple bond into a trans double bond.

Then step 3: O3 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. So if the molecule is cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls.

Wait, but if the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond in the middle, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, giving cyclohexane-CHO and another aldehyde or ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the cyclohexane would have two carbonyls, but the target has only one aldehyde. Maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in B converts the alkyne into an internal alkyne, which after ozonolysis would form two carbonyls on the same ring, leading to a diketone, which then undergoes some condensation.

This is getting too vague. Maybe another approach: the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl group. How is that formed?

Perhaps it's a result of a Grignard addition to a carbonyl, followed by hydrolysis. So, if a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) is added to a carbonyl, it would form an alcohol after protonation.

So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group, forming the substituent.

Looking at the options, which sequence would form the aldehyde and then add the cyclohexyl group.

Option D: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which would give aldehydes. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which may not add anything. But after O3, you get aldehydes.

Hmm. Let me think of the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this converts the alkyne into a ketone via hydration, giving cyclohexanone.

2. Step 2: Li and NH3 → perhaps forms a strong base, but I'm not sure.

3. Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds into carbonyls. But if step 1 gave a ketone, and step 2 did something else, maybe the molecule now has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is alkylation and step 2 is deprotonation to form an alkene, which is then cleaved.

I'm still stuck. Maybe I should look for the sequence that forms the aldehyde and adds the cyclohexyl group.

Another possibility: the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl. So, after forming the aldehyde, a Grignard reagent (cyclohexyl MgBr) adds, forming a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes some oxidation or remains as is.

But I don't see Grignard reagents in any of the options. So perhaps the substituent forms via a different method.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide. The epoxide could be formed by epoxidizing an alkene, then opening it with a nucleophile to attach the cyclohexyl group.

But again, I don't see epoxidation reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via an acid-catalyzed addition, but I'm not sure.

Given that I'm struggling, perhaps I should consider the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let's think again about option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylated alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → triple to single bond.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → no reaction, because triple bond is gone.

So steps 3 and 4 wouldn't do anything. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this forms a ketone.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → perhaps forms a Grignard-like reagent.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 converts the alkyne into a propargyl alcohol, which then undergoes some reaction.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The target has an aldehyde, which suggests ozonolysis of a double bond. So the correct sequence must include ozonolysis. Looking at options, B and D have ozonolysis steps.

Between B and D: option B's step 3 is O3/H2O, which would give carbonyls, maybe ketones. Option D's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup that gives aldehydes and ketones.

The target has an aldehyde, which suggests the use of a reductive workup. So option D's step 3 would give an aldehyde, while option B's would give ketones.

So, the correct sequence would form the aldehyde via ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a workup.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne and quenches with methanol, forming a ketone.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → perhaps forms a Grignard reagent.

Wait, but without an electrophilic carbonyl, the Grignard wouldn't do much.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a hydration to form a ketone (cyclohexanone), step 2 is a Grignard addition, step 3 is ozonolysis, which doesn't make sense because there's no double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up steps. Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis of a ring-opened epoxide.

But I'm not confident. Given that, I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH. That suggests that perhaps a cyclohexyl group was added via a Grignard or organometallic reaction to a carbonyl group, followed by hydrolysis to form the alcohol.

So, the steps would be:

1. Convert alkyne to a carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone).

2. Add a Grignard reagent (cyclohexyl MgBr) to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol upon protonation.

But in the options, only some include Grignard-like steps.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride might form an alkyne, then step 2 could be hydrogenation to a single bond, but I don't see Grignard reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl, but I'm not seeing it.

At this point, I'm going to make an educated guess. Since the target has an aldehyde, and the reagent needed is ozonolysis with reductive workup, I'm thinking that option D is the correct one.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → forms a ketone via hydration.

2. Li and NH3 → forms a strong base, perhaps deprotonating for a reaction.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds to form aldehydes.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps protonating any deprotonated groups.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, option C could be correct because of the hydrogenation step.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to become a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates alkyne to single bond.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → no reaction since there's no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. This isn't making sense. I think I'll have to go with option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: the target's substituent has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction, like an SN2, where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group.

But I don't see any leaving groups being introduced in the steps.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the presence of ozonolysis with (CH3)2S in option D, which would form an aldehyde, I'll go with option C.

Wait, no, no. The correct sequence would have ozonolysis after forming a double bond.

Wait, the correct sequence is to alkylate, then form a double bond, then ozonolyse to form the aldehyde.

So, ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated to longer alkyne → converted to trans-alkene → ozonolysis to form aldehyde.

Which option does that?

Looking at option B:

Step 1: alkylate to longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → perhaps form trans-alkene.

Step 3: O3 → cleaves to aldehyde.

So option B could be the correct sequence. Because after step 2, there's a double bond which is cleaved in step 3 to form the aldehyde.

Then, how does the substituent form?

Ah, perhaps the substituent comes from the ethyl group that was added in step 1.

Wait, if the alkyne is alkylated with ethyl chloride, making a longer alkyne, then converted to a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. One of them would be a ketone and the other an aldehyde, perhaps.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH).

Step 1 (B): NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CC≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2 (B): Li and NH3 → forms a trans-alkene, so structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond in the middle.

Wait, no. The structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2, but I'm not getting the correct structure.

Alternatively, the alkyne becomes a trans-alkene: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between the second and third carbon.

Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls: one at the cyclohexane end (cyclohexanone) and another at the other end (propanal or something).

Hmm, but the target has an aldehyde on the main ring and a substituent with a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group after alkylation is what forms the substituent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent and the thought process, I'll have to make a decision.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent at position 1, which is a CH group attached to a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the terminal alkyne, extending the carbon chain.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination, but it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the target molecule.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, and H₂O suggest hydration, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the aldehyde group or the substituent.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li and liquid NH₃ likely deprotonate the alkyne and form a trans-alkene.
   - Step 3: O₃ and H₂O cleave the double bond formed in Step 2 into carbonyl groups, which could include an aldehyde.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a mild reducing agent, possibly for workup after ozonolysis.
   - This sequence could plausibly form the aldehyde group, but the origin of the cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl substituent is unclear.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, extending the carbon chain.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain.
   - Step 3: O₃ with (CH₃)₂S is a reductive workup for ozonolysis, but no double bond is present after Step 2, so this step would not react.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role is unclear in forming the target molecule.
   - This sequence does not logically lead to the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely hydrate the alkyne to form a ketone (cyclohexanone).
   - Step 2: Li and liquid NH₃ is a strong base, possibly for deprotonation or forming a Grignard-like reagent.
   - Step 3: O₃ with (CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but no double bond is explicitly formed in the sequence.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a mild reducing agent, but its role is unclear in forming the target molecule.
   - This sequence does not clearly form the aldehyde group or the substituent.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl substituent. Option B includes ozonolysis (Step 3) with H₂O, which could cleave a double bond to form an aldehyde. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl substituent is formed. Despite this ambiguity, Option B is the most plausible sequence compared to the other options.

**Answer: B**
