Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, the first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state because quantum states must have a norm (or length) of 1. 

Wait, right. The state is given as proportional, so we need to find the normalization factor. The normalization factor is found by taking the inner product of the state with itself and then taking the square root of that. 

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, the inner product would be the sum of the squares of the amplitudes. Let me compute that.

The amplitude for |up> is (1+i). So, |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because for a complex number a+bi, the square is a² + b². Similarly, for |down>, the amplitude is (2-i). The square of that is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So, the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, so that's the normalized state. Now, the next part is about another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2 since we're dealing with spin up and down. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements A11 and A22 are zero, and the off-diagonal elements A12 and A21 are hbar/2 each.

Wait, so the matrix looks like this:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix. Now, what is this operator? Well, I think this is related to spin in the x or y direction, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Pauli X or Y matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So, perhaps the given operator is proportional to X or Y.

Wait, the matrix we have is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], which is the same as (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal, and zero on diagonal. So this operator would be (hbar/2) σ_x. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so yeah.

So, the operator is A = (hbar/2) σ_x. Since σ_x has eigenstates that are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction. So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, because it's just a scalar multiple.

But wait, the question is asking about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A. So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. So, the eigenstates |+x> and |−x> perhaps.

But wait, the initial state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of σ_z. So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A (which is σ_x), I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of σ_x.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenstates, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates. Then the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

So, let's try to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

The matrix A is:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

The determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

So, λ² = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So, the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = hbar/2: (A - λI)|v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:
[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  -hbar/2 ]

Which is a homogeneous system. The equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 +v2=0 → v1 = v2.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

The matrix is:
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Which gives the equations:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So, the eigenvectors are (1, -1).

But wait, we need to normalize these, so the eigenvectors are:

For +hbar/2: (1,1)/sqrt(2)
For -hbar/2: (1,-1)/sqrt(2)

So, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), but their coefficients might be in terms of |up> and |down> as the basis. So, yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the state |alpha> is given as:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

We need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

So, substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) 

= [ (c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |down>

This must equal the original expression:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So, equating coefficients:

(c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
(c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as equations:

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) (1 + i)
Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) (2 -i)

Now, adding equations 1 and 2:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i) → 3 → 3
So, 2 c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= 3/(2 sqrt(7/2)) ) Hmm, perhaps better to rationalize:

Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2/7). So,

c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 * sqrt(14)) ) / (2*7) )? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute it differently.

Alternatively, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7), so c_+ is (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = numerator: 3*sqrt(2) and denominator: 2 sqrt(7).

Wait, but maybe I should compute c_+ and c_- in terms of their values.

Let me compute equation 1 and 2:

From equation 1: c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
From equation 2: c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Adding them:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2 c_+ = [3] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7)

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2 c_- = [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] → (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))
= [2i -1 ] * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the subtraction:

Equation1 - Equation2:

(c_+ + c_- ) - (c_+ - c_- ) = (1 +i - 2 +i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2 c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So, c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm, that's the expression for c_-. 

But I'm not sure if I need to proceed further with this approach. Maybe a better approach is to compute the coefficients by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A.

Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and that eigenstate.

So, for the eigenstate |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the amplitude is < +x | alpha >.

Compute this:

< +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] multiplied by the vector representation of |alpha>.

Wait, |alpha> in vector form is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

So, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7))

= [ 3 ] / (sqrt(14) )

So, the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, the amplitude for the eigenstate |−x> is < -x | alpha >.

The eigenstate |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so vector is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

Inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(14)

= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14)

= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)

The absolute value squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, wait a minute, that adds up to 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so that looks correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, looking at the options, option A has these probabilities. But I also need to check the average value of the operator.

The average value <A> is the expectation value of A in the |alpha> state.

Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

The expectation value of σ_x is given by <alpha | σ_x | alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, <A> is (hbar/2) <σ_x>.

Now, σ_x has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, let's compute <alpha | σ_x | alpha>.

The state |alpha> in vector form is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, σ_x acting on |alpha> gives [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, the inner product <alpha | σ_x | alpha> is:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait no, that's not correct. Because σ_x swaps the components. So, σ_x |alpha> = [ (2−i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, the inner product is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]* [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (a* b + c* d), where a is the first component of <alpha|, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b is the first component of σ_x |alpha>, which is (2−i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, c is (2−i)/sqrt(7) and d is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

So,

(1+i)(2−i)/(7) + (2−i)(1+i)/(7)
= [ (1*2 + 1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) ) + (2*1 + 2*i -i*1 -i^2) ] /7

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute each product.

First product: (1+i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) = 2 -i +2i -i². Since i²=-1, this becomes 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Second product: (2−i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i -i*1 -i*i = 2 +2i -i -i². Again, i²=-1, so this is 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Adding the two: (3+i) + (3+i) = 6 +2i.

So, the sum is (6 +2i)/7.

But wait, this is the inner product, <alpha | σ_x | alpha> = (6 +2i)/7.

So, the expectation value is (6 +2i)/7.

Wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value of an observable (like σ_x) must be real. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the inner product.

Wait, the inner product is (a* b + c* d), where a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2−i)/sqrt(7), c is (2−i)/sqrt(7), and d is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

So,

(1+i)(2−i) /7 + (2−i)(1+i)/7.

Wait, both terms are the same, since multiplication is commutative.

So, each term is (1+i)(2−i) = (1*2 +1*(-i) + i*2 +i*(-i)) = 2 -i +2i -i² → 2 +i +1 =3 +i. Because i²=-1.

So, each term is (3 +i)/7. Adding them gives 2*(3+i)/7 = (6 + 2i)/7.

Wait, but that's giving a complex number, which cannot be the case for an expectation value. So, I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the elements. Let me try a different approach. Let me write |alpha> as a column vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σ_x |alpha> is [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ; (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, the inner product <alpha | σ_x | alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by σ_x |alpha>.

So, the conjugate of |alpha> is [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiply by σ_x |alpha>:

= (1−i)/sqrt(7) * (2−i)/sqrt(7) ) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

Compute each term.

First term: (1−i)(2−i)/7

= (1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) ) /7
= (2 −i −2i +i² ) /7
= (2 −3i −1 )/7
= (1 −3i )/7

Second term: (2+i)(1+i)/7

= (2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i) /7
= (2 +2i +i +i² ) /7
= (2 +3i −1 )/7
= (1 +3i )/7

Now, adding both terms:

(1 −3i +1 +3i ) /7 = (2)/7.

So, expectation value of σ_x is 2/7.

Wait, that makes sense because it's real. So, <σ_x> = 2/7.

Therefore, the expectation value of A, which is (hbar/2) σ_x, is (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

So, the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. Which matches our earlier calculation. So the correct option should be option A.

The problem involves an electron in the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The first step is to normalize this state. The squared norm is calculated as:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), and the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation \(A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2}\) if \(i \neq j\), and \(A_{ij} = 0\) otherwise. This corresponds to the operator:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x
\]

where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \(A\) are the eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\), which are:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \(|+x⟩\) and \(|-x⟩\), we compute the inner products \(\langle +x | α \rangle\) and \(\langle -x | α \rangle\). Substituting the expressions for \(|+x⟩\) and \(|-x⟩\) into these inner products:

\[
\langle +x | α \rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

\[
\langle -x | α \rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes:

\[
P(+x) = \left|\langle +x | α \rangle\right|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64
\]

\[
P(-x) = \left|\langle -x | α \rangle\right|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

Next, the average value of the operator \(A\) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle α | \sigma_x | α \rangle
\]

The expectation value of \(\sigma_x\) in the state \(|α⟩\) is computed using the matrix representation of \(\sigma_x\):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle α | \sigma_x | α \rangle = \frac{2}{7}
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the given options:

- Probabilities: \(0.64\) and \(0.36\)
- Average value: \(\hbar / 7\)

These match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
