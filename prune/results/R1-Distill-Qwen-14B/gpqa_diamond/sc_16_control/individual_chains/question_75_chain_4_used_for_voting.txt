Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The researcher made a construct to overexpress GADD45G with an added HA tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect CHO cells, and the plasmid has an antibiotic resistance marker. But when they tested, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand sequence and noticed an issue.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to analyze it for possible issues. The first thing I notice is the start and end of the coding sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then there's the HA tag sequence. I'm not exactly sure of the exact HA tag sequence, but it's usually around 10-11 amino acids, so it's probably somewhere in the beginning.

Wait, let's look at the beginning of the sequence. The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Hmm. So the start is ATG, then TAC which is tyrosine, then CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), etc. So the HA tag is probably the first part after ATG.

But wait, I'm more interested in possible stop codons, because if the ribosome hits a stop codon early, the protein won't be made. Let's look for the presence of any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence is a long stretch. Let's go through it:

Looking for TGA, TAA, TAG. Let's see.

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, the 10th codon is TAC (tyrosine), then GAT (aspartate), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartate), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop). Oh, wait! The 18th codon is TGA. That's a stop codon. So the reading frame would terminate there. So the protein would be truncated after that point.

So the construct has a premature stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early. That would prevent the full-length protein from being made, including the HA tag and the rest of GADD45G. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed because the coding sequence is truncated.

So the issue is that the coding sequence has a premature stop codon. Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would fit.

Other options: A) HA has a missense mutation. But the HA sequence would be at the N-terminus, which is the start. The stop is after that, so the HA wouldn't even be fully formed. But the question is why the overexpression isn't happening. If HA had a mutation, perhaps it would affect purification, but the initial problem is lack of expression.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If proteolysis were happening, you might get degradation after expression, but the construct would still be made. The problem here is that the protein isn't expressed at all, or not in the expected size. So this is less likely.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, the stop codon is TGA, not UAA. Wait, the mRNA is read as TGA, which is a stop codon. Mouse cells do have tRNAs for termination. So D is about the UAA codon, but our stop is TGA. So D isn't the issue here.

So the main problem is the premature stop codon, which is option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an HA tag in a transgenic mouse model but observes no overexpression. Upon analyzing the provided DNA sequence, a premature stop codon (TGA) is identified at the 18th codon. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. As a result, the HA-tagged GADD45G protein is not produced, leading to the lack of overexpression.

Option A suggests a missense mutation in the HA tag, but the issue lies in the premature stop codon, not the HA sequence itself. Option C proposes proteolysis due to a missing linker, but this would not prevent the initial synthesis of the protein. Option D refers to the absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon, but the stop codon in question is TGA, which is a valid termination signal in mouse cells. Therefore, the correct explanation is that the premature stop codon causes early termination of translation.
