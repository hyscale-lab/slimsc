Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Right, spin-z operator. So the state is a linear combination of these two.

First, I think I need to normalize the state. Because when they say it's proportional, that means it's not necessarily normalized yet. So I should calculate the normalization constant. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Let me compute that. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The absolute squares are |1+i|² and |2-i|². 

|1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (a+bi)(a-bi)=a² +b². So 1²+1²=2.

|2-i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4+1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So, the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, okay, but the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator. The operator's matrix is given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because the state is two-dimensional (|up> and |down> are two states, spin-1/2 particles).

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:

A_11 =0, A_12= hbar/2,
A_21= hbar/2, A_22=0.

So it looks like this matrix:
[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, what does this matrix represent? Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) * X.

So the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X. The eigenstates of the Pauli X are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. But wait, the state |alpha> is written in the z-basis. So the eigenstates of X would be superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So each eigenstate corresponds to a possible outcome when measuring operator A.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenvalues for X are +1 and -1, so for A, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1).

But for the probabilities, I don't need the eigenvalues but the eigenstates. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, because then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this without switching bases. Another method is to find the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A, find its eigenstates, and then compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Wait, but since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenstates are known. The eigenstates of X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Yes, because X|+x> = |+x>, and X|-x> = -| -x>?

Wait, let me confirm. The eigenstates of X are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Because X acting on |+x> gives (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = |+x>, so eigenvalue 1.

Similarly, X acting on |-x> gives (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = - (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) = - |-x> , so eigenvalue -1.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X, scaled by hbar/2.

So, now I need to express the given state |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can compute the coefficients by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

But let's proceed.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me write |alpha> as:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So to get the expansion in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Let me denote:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, if I can write |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>, then the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

So, let's compute c_+ and c_-.

c_+ = < +x | alpha >,

c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Compute < +x | alpha >:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( < up | + < down | ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)
Wait, let me compute inner product step by step.

The inner product < +x | alpha > is:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] * [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) < up | up > + (2 -i) < down | up > + (1+i) < up | down > + (2 -i) < down | down > ]

But < up | down > is zero, and similar for other cross terms. So:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i)*1 ]

Because < up | up > is 1, < down | down > is 1.

So,

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + 2 + i -i = 3.

So c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- is < -x | alpha >.

< -x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( < up | - < down | ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) < up | up > - (2 -i) < down | down > ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1 + 2i).

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, let me compute that again.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i+i) = (-1) + 2i. Yep.

So, c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14.

Compute | (-1 + 2i) |^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2 =5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. That's correct; normalization holds.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. So approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. But let me check the other part of the question: the average value of operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha> .

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Wait, operator A has eigenvalues (hbar/2) * (1) and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So, the expectation value is (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) ) = [ (9 -5) * hbar/2 ] /14.

(4 hbar /2) /14 = (2 hbar) /14 = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's option A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, another approach to compute the expectation value is using the operator's matrix.

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7). So in vector form, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose multiplied by A multiplied by the vector.

So,

< A > = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T.

Wait, wait, more accurately:

< A > = (1/7) [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] * A * [ (1+i) ; (2-i) ]

Because the vector is column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

So,

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So, compute A * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T:

= [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)*(2 - i) ), 
     ( (hbar/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ]^T
= [ (hbar/2)(2 -i), (hbar/2)(1+i) ]^T

Then, the product [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * [ ... ] is:

(1-i)*(hbar/2)(2 -i) + (2+i)*(hbar/2)(1+i)

Compute each term:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) = (2)(1) + (1)(-i) -i*(2) + i^2*(1) 

Wait, 1*2=2, 1*(-i)= -i, (-i)*2= -2i, (-i)*(-i)= i^2= -1.

So:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) ) = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i^2*i.

Wait, 2*1=2, 2i, i*1= i, i^2= -1.

So:

2 + 2i + i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 + 3i.

So,

Total sum: [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] = 2.

So,

< A > = (hbar/2) * (2) /7 = (hbar/2 * 2 ) /7 = hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So this matches.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure. Option D is 0.61, 0.29 etc. No, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed. The state of the particle is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \) are \( (1+i) \) and \( (2-i) \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]
\[
\text{Normalization factor} = \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The matrix representation of \( A \) is:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, whose eigenstates are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
These eigenstates correspond to the eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates:
\[
c_{+} = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}},
\]
\[
c_{-} = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
c_{+} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_{-} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
P(+x) = |c_{+}|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_{-}|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the eigenvalues of \( A \) and their probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot P(+x) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot P(-x).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} - \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
