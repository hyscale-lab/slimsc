Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about the elemental abundances in two stars and finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. I remember that [X/Y] notation is used to denote the logarithmic abundance ratio relative to another star. Let me think about what each of these values means.

So, Star_1 has a [Si/Fe] of 0.3 dex. That means that the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times higher than in the Sun. Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, actually, the general formula is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. So n_Si/n_Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So the abundance of magnesium relative to silicon is higher in Star_2 by 10^(0.3) compared to the Sun.

Wait, but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given, so I think we need to compute their abundances relative to hydrogen as well. Oh wait, no. Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, which is similar to [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, meaning that the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Same for Star_2 and Mg: [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithmic abundance of Fe relative to H, compared to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 means that log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So n_Fe/n_H for Star_1 is same as Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so n_Mg/n_H in Star_2 is same as in Sun.

Now, the Sun's compositions are given: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH =10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) = -5, so nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. For the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg/nH =10^(-5) =1e-5.

So, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe/nH = same as Sun. So nFe/nH =3.16e-5. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun +0.3.

Wait, nSi/nFe in Sun: nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) * (nH/nH) → but wait, nSi/nFe = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH) ) × (nH/nH) → no, that's correct. So from the Sun's nSi/nH and nFe/nH, the ratio nSi/nFe for the Sun is (nSi/nH)/(nFe/nH) ) = (1.34e-5) / (3.16e-5) ) → Wait, wait, what's the Sun's nSi/nH?

Wait, wait, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe], so maybe I have to compute it. The Sun's nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5. But what about nSi/nH? Hmm, the question doesn't provide that. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero? Or, perhaps, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given as [Mg/Si]_sun = 0, but no, that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5. Similarly, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

But the Sun's [Mg/Fe] would be log(nMg/nFe) = log( (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ) = log(0.316) ≈ -0.5. So [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

Wait, but this might not be necessary yet. Let me get back to Star_1 and Star_2.

For Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe/nH = same as Sun → 3.16e-5.

- [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 → 0.3 → nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times that of the Sun.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct. The [X/Y] is the logarithm of (nX/nY)_star divided by (nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun +0.3.

But what's (nSi/nFe)_sun? That's (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) = (something) / (3.16e-5). Wait, but I don't have the Sun's nSi/nH. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the problem gives us the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. So perhaps I'm supposed to get the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data. Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0. Let me see.

Wait, Star_2: [Mg/H]=0 → nMg/nH = same as Sun →1e-5.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun +0.3.

Wait, so the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Let me compute that.

nMg/nSi = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) → in the Sun, (1e-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun.

So [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (1e-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun ) = log(1e-5) - log(nSi/nH)_sun.

But I don't know nSi/nH in the Sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi in terms of nFe and [Si/Fe], but I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each star's composition.

For Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe/nH = nFe_sun / nH_sun × (nH_1 / nH_sun) )? Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH)_star - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun × (nH_1 / nH_sun). But since the problem is about ratios, maybe the absolute densities don't matter, only the ratios. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps all I need is the ratio of silicon in each star relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio of the two.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

Wait, but how do I get n_Si for each star?

Wait, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 10^0.3 × ([Si/Fe]_sun +1?), no. Wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^(0.3) × (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → because [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun).

So nFe_1 = nFe_sun × (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, but if the photosphere's composition is scaled by the same H, perhaps I can express everything in terms of H.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all the elements in terms of H.

Let me try to compute n_Si/n_H for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1 ) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) × 10^0.3.

So, n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 × (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) ×10^0.3.

But n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) × n_H_1.

Hmm, but how does n_H_1 compare to n_H_sun? Well, perhaps the total hydrogen could be different, but since the problem is about elemental ratios, maybe I can express everything in terms of the Sun's scale.

Wait, perhaps I can define the Sun's element abundances as a base, and express each star's abundances relative to that.

Let me consider that for each star, the abundance of each element is expressed as a multiple of the Sun's.

Let me denote for Star_1:

n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun × (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

Similarly, n_Si_1 = n_Si_sun × (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) × (something).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me compute the ratio n_Si/n_H for each star.

For Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 =0.

So, n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1 = 10^0.3 × (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) × n_H_1.

So, n_Si_1 = [n_Fe_1] × (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) ×10^0.3.

But n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun × n_H_1 ) / n_H_sun.

So, n_Si_1 = (n_Fe_sun × n_H_1 / n_H_sun) ) × (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) ×10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun × n_H_1 ) / n_H_sun × 10^0.3.

So, n_Si_1 / n_H_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) × 10^0.3.

Which implies that [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si_1/n_H_1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = log( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ×10^0.3 / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log(10^0.3) = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, that makes sense because if [Fe/H] is 0, and [Si/Fe] is 0.3, then [Si/H] would be 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) +0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg_2/n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun × n_H_2)/n_H_sun.

So, let's compute n_Si_2 in terms of n_Mg_2.

n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun × n_H_2)/n_H_sun.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 =10^0.3 × (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

So, n_Si_2 = n_Mg_2 / (10^0.3 × (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun)).

Substituting n_Mg_2:

n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_sun × n_H_2 / n_H_sun) ) / (10^0.3 × (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )).

Simplify:

n_Si_2 = n_H_2 × (n_Mg_sun × n_Si_sun) ) / (n_H_sun × 10^0.3 × n_Mg_sun )

The n_Mg_sun cancels out:

n_Si_2 = n_H_2 × (n_Si_sun) / (n_H_sun ×10^0.3 )

So,

n_Si_2 /n_H_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) × 10^{-0.3}.

Which implies that [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si_2/n_H_2) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log(10^{-0.3}) = -0.3.

Hmm, so Star_1 has [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and Star_2 has [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So n_Si_1 /n_Si_2.

Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2) ) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ).

Wait, because (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2) = (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ) × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2 /n_Si_2) )? Maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming that the number of H atoms in each star is the same as in the Sun? Or perhaps not. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the stars' sizes, so perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is (n_Si_1) / (n_Si_2) = (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2 /n_Si_2 )

Wait, maybe the ratio can be expressed in terms of [Si/H] and some other factors.

Wait, let's think about it.

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) ×10^0.3 ×n_H_1.

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H_2.

So the ratio n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = [ (10^0.3 ×n_H_1 ) / (10^{-0.3} ×n_H_2 ) ] × [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ].

Which simplifies to (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) → 10^{0.6} × (n_H_1/n_H_2 ).

But wait, if the stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms as the Sun, then n_H_1 =n_H_sun × ... wait, but the problem doesn't state that. Hmm, maybe they have a different number of hydrogen atoms, but without knowing, I can't find the ratio of n_Si_1 to n_Si_2.

Wait, unless I can find the ratio of H in both stars relative to the Sun. Since [Fe/H]_1 =0, n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun × (n_H_1/n_H_sun ). Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 →n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun ×(n_H_2/n_H_sun).

But without knowing anything else, I can't determine n_H_1 and n_H_2 relative to the Sun. So maybe I'm missing a step here.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the total number of H in the photosphere is the same as the Sun, but that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the ratios of H in each star relative to the Sun.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of H between the two stars is the same as the ratio of Fe in Star_1 to Mg in Star_2, but that sounds unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon in the two stars is simply (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 ) ) × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

Wait, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Since [Fe/H]_1=0, the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

So, the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is [Si/Fe]_1 × (Fe/H)_1 = 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's [Si/H].

Wait, wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 → 0 + 0.3 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]=0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So, 0 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to that in Star_2 is (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 ) ) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )

But that's (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3} )) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )

Because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 → (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 )= (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ×10^{-0.3}.

So, the ratio (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 ) ) = (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3} ) ) =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But then we also have the factor (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ), which is the ratio of hydrogen in Star_2 compared to Star_1.

Wait, but without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, I can't find the overall ratio of Si.

Unless I can find this ratio from other data.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I can find n_H_1 and n_H_2 relative to the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun × (n_H_1 /n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 →n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun × (n_H_2 /n_H_sun).

But I don't have any other information about the abundances of other elements in the stars. Hmm. So perhaps the H ratios are the same as in the Sun, meaning n_H_1 =n_H_sun × something, and n_H_2 =n_H_sun × another thing. But without more info, I can't determine the ratio of n_H_1 to n_H_2.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the fact that the ratio of H in each star is determined by the other elements. For example, maybe I can relate n_H_1 and n_H_2 via another element.

Alternatively, perhaps since the problem mentions LTE and the EW method, which is about measuring abundances, but I think that's just background info and doesn't affect the calculations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each star has the same number of hydrogen atoms as the Sun, but that's an assumption. Let me see what happens if I make that assumption.

If n_H_1 =n_H_sun and n_H_2 =n_H_sun, then the ratio of Si would be (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 ) ) → (10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) / (10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )) )= 10^{0.6} ≈3.98. So the ratio would be about 3.98, which is option A) ~3.9.

But wait, that's assuming n_H_1 =n_H_2 = n_H_sun. But what if that's not the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_H_1 to n_H_2 can be found using another element. For example, considering Star_1's [Fe/H] and Star_2's [Mg/H], perhaps.

Wait, for Star_1:

n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun × (n_H_1 /n_H_sun )

For Star_2:

n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun × (n_H_2 /n_H_sun )

But without knowing the values of n_Fe_1 and n_Mg_2, I can't find the ratio of n_H_1 to n_H_2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.

Wait, the problem states that each star's photospheric composition is considered. So perhaps I can express the ratio of silicon in terms of the [Si/H] values and the ratio of H in each star.

The ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2 is (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2) = (n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) × (n_H_1/n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2/n_Si_2 )

Which is (10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) × (n_H_1/n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2/(10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) )

Simplifying this:

(10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ) × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) )

Wait, all the terms cancel except 10^{0.6}.

Wait, because 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6}.

And (n_H_1/n_H_2) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )=1.

So, (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So, the ratio is about 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, so option A.

But wait, earlier I thought that I couldn't determine the ratio of H, but perhaps the ratio of H cancels out in this case because n_H_1 and n_H_2 are present in both numerator and denominator and thus cancel.

Ah, that makes sense! Because the ratio is (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) = (n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) × (n_H_1/n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2/n_Si_2 )

But (n_Si_1/n_H_1 )=10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

(n_Si_2/n_H_2 )=10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

So, (n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) ) = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6}.

Thus, (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) =10^{0.6} × (n_H_2/n_H_1 ) × (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )^{-1} → Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, no, the ratio (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) = (n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) × (n_H_1/n_H_2 ) × (n_H_2/n_Si_2 )

But (n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) =10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

Similarly, (n_Si_2/n_H_2 )=10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

So, (n_Si_1/n_Si_2 ) = [10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) × n_H_1 ] / [10^{-0.3} × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) ×n_H_2 ]

Simplify:

= [10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} ] × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

= 10^{0.6} × (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

But wait, the problem is that without knowing the ratio of n_H_1 to n_H_2, we can't compute this.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of H in each star can be determined from their other abundances.

Wait, looking back, the problem gives [Fe/H]_1=0, which implies that Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun × (n_H_1 /n_H_sun )

For Star_2:

n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun × (n_H_2 /n_H_sun )

But without knowing how much Fe or Mg is in either star (other than their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]), I can't find n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Wait, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms in each star is the same as in the Sun, but that's an assumption. If that's the case, then n_H_1 =n_H_2 =n_H_sun → the H terms cancel, and the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the answer would be approximately 3.9, option A.

But wait, what if that assumption is incorrect? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H cancels because the problem is only asking for the ratio of silicon atoms and not their absolute numbers. Or perhaps because the question uses the same photospheric composition for both stars, the H ratio cancels out.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the ratio of H terms would cancel, leading to the ratio being 10^0.6.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that the ratio of silicon atoms is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + 0.3.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun + 0.3.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg_2/n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - 12 + log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 7.5 → log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 10^(-4.5).
   - 12 + log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun = 7 → log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun = -5 → n_Mg/n_H)_sun = 10^(-5).

### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Each Star
For **Star_1**:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 = 0 imply that log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + 0.3.
- Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. Thus, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

For **Star_2**:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 imply that log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun + 0.3.
- Rearranging, [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3.

### Step 2: Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1/n_H_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2/n_H_2} \cdot \frac{n_H_2}{n_H_1}.
\]

From the abundances:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1/n_H_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2/n_H_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{sun}}/n_H_{\text{sun}})}{10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{sun}}/n_H_{\text{sun}})} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Assuming the ratio of hydrogen atoms in the two stars is the same as in the Sun (i.e., \(n_H_1 = n_H_2 = n_H_{\text{sun}}\)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
