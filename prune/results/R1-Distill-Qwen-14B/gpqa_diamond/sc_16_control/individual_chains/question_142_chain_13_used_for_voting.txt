Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). The question gives a specific density matrix and asks where it's located in the qubit space. 

Let me write down the given matrix. The density matrix rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, |0><0| is a matrix that's 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere, right? Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the (1,1) position. So adding them together would give a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 1 each, and the off-diagonal are 0. Then multiplying by 1/2, all diagonal elements become 0.5. So rho looks like:

[0.5 0]
[0 0.5]

I think in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? Oh right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (like a Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So if I can express the given rho in that form, r will be the vector we're looking for. Let me expand that: rho = (I + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)) / 2. 

Looking at the given rho, the diagonal elements are 0.5 and 0.5. The (0,0) element is (1 + r_z)/2, and the (1,1) element is (1 - r_z)/2. So setting those equal:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → same result, r_z=0.

Now, the off-diagonal elements are r_x/(2) and r_y/(2) multiplied by i and -i for σ_x and σ_y. Wait, I think σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is diagonal. So when you compute I + r·σ, the off-diagonal terms are r_x and -r_y i. 

In rho, the off-diagonal terms are zero. So looking at the (0,1) element of rho, which is 0. So from the expression (I + r·σ)/2, the (0,1) element would be (r_x (1) + r_y (-i)) / 2. But our rho has zero there. Therefore, both coefficients must be zero. So r_x must be zero, and r_y must be zero as well. Because if r_x + (−i r_y) =0, then both r_x and r_y are zero.

So putting it all together, r_z is zero, r_x is zero, r_y is zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but what does that mean? The origin in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, that makes sense because the given rho is a completely mixed state. The completely mixed state has no direction in the Bloch sphere, so it's at the center. So the position is (0,0,0). 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten in terms of the Pauli matrices as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector representing the state in qubit space. For the given \( \rho \), the diagonal elements are \( 0.5 \) and the off-diagonal elements are \( 0 \). Comparing this to the general form \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \), we find:

1. The diagonal elements of \( \rho \) give \( r_z = 0 \).
2. The off-diagonal elements of \( \rho \) give \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to a completely mixed state with no direction in qubit space.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \):** Incorrect, as the state is not a pure state on the Bloch sphere.  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \):** Incorrect, as the state is not aligned along the \( z \)-axis.  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \):** Correct, as the state is at the origin, representing a completely mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
