Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. The question focuses on luminosity, which I think is more about energy output rather than mass directly. So maybe mass isn't directly relevant unless it's about something like temperature.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength. I remember this from blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because the displacement constant is the same for both. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then I'm confused because if the temperatures are the same, and luminosity depends on radius and temperature, then maybe the other parameters come into play. Like, luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same temperature, T is the same for both. So L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, R1/R2 is 1.5. Squared is (1.5)^2 which is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, which seems like the straightforward answer. But the choices go beyond that, like option C is ~2.35. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but the problem mentions something else. Oh yeah, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, how does radial velocity affect this? Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But I'm not sure how that connects to luminosity. Wait, unless it's about the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength. But earlier, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that might imply that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But if they are moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be Doppler shifted.

Wait, perhaps the stars have different intrinsic temperatures, but due to their velocities, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual temperatures are different because of their velocities.

Wait, but the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. So the equation would involve their actual temperatures adjusted by their radial velocities.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the λ_max observed would be affected by the Doppler effect. So the star's actual temperature would be different, but when we observe their λ_max, it's the same. Let me think.

Wien's law is about the peak wavelength emitted by the star, which depends on its temperature. But when the star is moving relative to us, we observe a Doppler-shifted wavelength. So the observed λ_max would be different from the emitted λ_max.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So if the stars have different velocities, their actual temperatures could be different, but their observed λ_max would be adjusted by their velocity, leading them to have the same observed λ_max.

So let's model this.

The emitted λ_max is given by λ_emitted = b / T.

But due to the Doppler effect, what we observe is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) if v_r is the radial velocity towards us. Wait, no, the Doppler formula is a bit more precise. The relativistic Doppler shift is λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but this is when the source is moving away. Wait, actually, when the source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive when moving away.

Wait, but in our case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so v1 = 0 km/s. Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify direction. Oh, wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. I think radial velocity is positive when moving away from us, but sometimes it's the opposite. But actually, the sign doesn't matter because we're looking for the square in the ratio, but perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, for the Doppler shift formula, if the star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. Alternatively, the formula in terms of velocity is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), assuming non-relativistic speeds, which is valid here since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (~3e5 km/s). So for small velocities, the approximate formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c), but since v is positive for moving away, the wavelength would increase. But when the star is moving towards us, it blueshifts, so λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 - v/c).

But in our problem, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Now, I'm not sure if it's moving towards or away. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume it's moving away, which would make v positive. So the observed λ_obs2 would be longer than λ_emit2.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, substituting:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) )

But v1 = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_emit is given by Wien's law: λ_emit = b / T.

So,

λ_emit1 = b / T1

λ_emit2 = b / T2

So substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

The b's cancel:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Rearranging,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Since v2 is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. Let me compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333...

So v2/c ≈ 0.002333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) ≈ 0.997666...

(1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333...

So the ratio is (0.997666)/(1.002333) ≈ (0.997666)/(1.002333) 

Let me compute that.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute (1 - x)/(1 + x) where x is small. For x <<1, (1-x)/(1+x) ≈ (1 - x)(1 - x) ) ≈ 1 - 2x, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x. So here, x is 0.002333.

So,

(1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ (1 - x)(1 - x) ) ≈ 1 - 2x.

So,

sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 2x) ≈ 1 - x, since sqrt(1 - y) ≈ 1 - y/2 for y small.

So,

sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ≈ 1 - x/ (something), but let me compute it numerically.

Wait, alternatively, compute the exact value.

(1 - x)/(1 + x) = (0.9976667) / (1.0023333) 

Let me compute 0.9976667 / 1.0023333.

Dividing 0.9976667 by 1.0023333:

Approximately 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99536.

Now, take the square root of this: sqrt(0.99536) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

T1 = T2 * 0.99768.

So, T1 is approximately 0.99768 * T2.

Wait, but that's T1 in terms of T2. Now, I'm a bit confused because this would mean T1 is slightly less than T2. But wait, Star_1 has a higher mass and radius, but if their observed λ_max is the same, perhaps their actual temperatures are different because of Doppler shift.

But wait, the luminosity calculation is based on their intrinsic (rest frame) parameters, right? Because Luminosity is the intrinsic property, not the observed.

Wait, but when calculating luminosity, we use the star's actual parameters, not the observed ones. So I think the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴ uses T, the star's actual temperature, not the observed temperature which is affected by Doppler shift.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the astronomers computed the luminosity based on the assumption that the stars are black bodies. So perhaps they would calculate the luminosity based on the observed data, including the Doppler shift.

Wait, but no, the problem states that the luminosity is computed based on the black body assumption, so I think they would use the intrinsic parameters, not the observed. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the observed flux is F = L/(4πd²), but in this problem, the distance might not be a factor as it's not mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps the stars are at the same distance, but the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of their luminosities, so perhaps the distance cancels out. Let me think: L is intrinsic. So assuming that the stars are at the same distance, the observed flux would be F = L/(4πd²). But the problem doesn't mention flux, only that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed flux peaks at the same λ, which is due to a combination of the star's temperature and its velocity.

Wait, maybe the stars have intrinsic temperatures T1 and T2, but due to their velocities, their observed λ_max is the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both, but the actual temperatures could be different.

So, for each star, the observed λ_max is given by considering both the intrinsic temperature and the Doppler shift.

For Star_1, which has v_r1 = 0, the observed λ_max1 = λ_emit1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, which has v_r2 = 700 km/s, the observed λ_max2 would be λ_emit2 multiplied by the Doppler factor.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), assuming v is positive when moving away.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs2 would be longer than λ_emit2. So if λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then:

λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c) / (1 - v1/c) ) ) = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But since v1 is zero, the left side is λ_emit1. So,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which as before, gives T1 in terms of T2.

But wait, the problem says that the stars' wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same. So,

λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Which leads to T1 and T2 being related by the Doppler shift.

But back to the luminosity. The luminosity is based on the star's actual radius and temperature, not the observed. So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴, and L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, we have to find (T1/T2)^4.

From earlier, we have T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Wait, because earlier, substituting into T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ), right?

Wait, let's re-express that. From the earlier steps:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which rearranged gives T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

We can compute this.

As before, v2 is 700 km/s. So v2/c is 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333...

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 0.9976667

(1 + v2/c) = 1.0023333

So,

(1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.99536 as before.

The square root of 0.99536 is approximately 0.99768.

So,

T1 / T2 ≈ 0.99768.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute (0.99768)^4.

First, 0.99768 is approximately 0.9977.

0.9977^2 ≈ 0.9954 (since (1 - 0.0023)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0023 = 0.9954).

Then, 0.9954^2 ≈ (0.9954) * (0.9954).

Let me compute 0.9954 * 0.9954:

= (1 - 0.0046)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.0046 + (0.0046)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0092 + 0.00002116 ≈ 0.99082116.

Wait, wait, let's compute it more accurately:

0.9954 * 0.9954:

= (0.995 * 10000 + 0.004) * (0.995 *10000 + 0.004) 

Wait, alternatively, 0.9954 * 0.9954:

= (1 - 0.0046) * (1 - 0.0046) 

= 1 - 2*0.0046 + (0.0046)^2 

= 1 - 0.0092 + 0.00002116 

= 0.99082116.

So, (0.9977)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

Wait, but that's (0.9977)^4 = (0.9977^2)^2 ≈ (0.9954)^2 ≈ 0.9908.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So, putting it all together,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 

= (2.25) * (0.9908) 

≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 2.25, which is option A. But considering the Doppler shift due to the velocity, the luminosity ratio is a bit less than 2.25, around 2.23.

So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their radii, temperatures, and radial velocities. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is therefore:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Thus, the radius ratio squared is:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, the intrinsic peak wavelength is related to temperature as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. However, the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the stars' radial velocities. For Star_1, the radial velocity is \(v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}\). For Star_2, with \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T\), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

The radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) corresponds to \(v_2/c \approx 0.002333\). Substituting this value:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.99536} \approx 0.99768
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99768)^4 \approx 0.9908
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \times 0.9908 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times that of Star_2. The closest option is:
