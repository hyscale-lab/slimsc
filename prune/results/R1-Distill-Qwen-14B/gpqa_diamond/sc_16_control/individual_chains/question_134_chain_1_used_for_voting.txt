Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given in kcal and kJ, which I need to remember—1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ, right?

First, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are reacting. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, in this case, there are three solutions being mixed. So maybe I should find the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution and see what's reacting.

Let's break it down. Each acid and base will contribute their H+ and OH- ions.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next is H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives two moles of H+. The solution is 300 mL, 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each mole gives two moles of OH-. The volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L, and molarity is 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So I need to find the limiting reactant here. The H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent because it's less.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of H2O. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles (0.28 - 0.2).

But wait, the neutralization enthalpy is typically based on the amount of H+ and OH- that react. The enthalpy change for each mole of H+ + OH- is usually about -57.3 kJ/mol, which is the standard enthalpy of neutralization.

So, the total enthalpy change would be moles of H+ reacted * ΔH. Since ΔH is negative because it's exothermic.

So, moles reacted are 0.2. So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. Wait, but the options have -16.0 kJ and others in kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the neutralization is for 0.2 mol.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,300 J/mol) → because 57.3 kJ is 57300 J. Alternatively, 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than my calculation. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, because 11.46 kJ is about 2.7 kJ, but in kcal, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, I need to convert.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Let me see. I've calculated the enthalpy change in kJ. So -11.46 kJ is approximately -11.5 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but my calculation is in kJ, not kcal.

Wait, the options are a mix, which is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So 0.2 mol H+ will react with 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh! Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but one of the options is in kJ.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.82 kcal (since 16 /4.184 is around 3.82). But wait, my calculation is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. So that would be about -2.74 kcal (11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). But none of the options match except for B which is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but the units are different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check.

Another perspective: The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting. So, the total H+ from the acid is 0.28 mol, but only 0.2 mol reacts (since OH- is 0.2). So the neutralization is for 0.2 mol H+.

So the calculation is 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. Which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the neutralization of all the H+ and OH- available, but that can't be, because there's excess H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering all the H+ from H2SO4, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, does it donate both H+ ions? Yes, because H2SO4 is a strong acid, both H+ are released.

Wait, maybe I should consider the stoichiometry correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the total neutralization without considering the excess H+.

Wait, but that can't be because the OH- is the limiting reactant. So, only 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- can react.

Wait, but another thing: the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ reacting. So 0.2 moles would give -11.46 kJ. So looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is about -16,000 J. My calculation is -11,460 J, which is close to option B if it's in kJ. But option B is in kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should convert my answer into kcal. So, 11.46 kJ is 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.738 kcal, which is about -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. Close, but why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol. 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.46 kJ. They have option D as -16.0 kJ. Hmm. Maybe I'm supposed to consider the total moles of H+ from all sources, but that would make no sense because the OH- is only 0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the first dissociation, it's strong, so H+ is released completely. The second H+ may not be as strong, but in reality, the second H+ is also quite strong, so I think it's considered as 2 H+ per mole.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the neutralization of all H+ and OH- ions, but that's not possible because H+ is in excess.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the total H+ and total OH- and then proceed, but that's not the case because the amount that reacts is the minimum of H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and see if there's any excess. But I think that's not the approach.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering the net ionic equation when all three are mixed. Let me think about the possible reactions.

HCl is H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

When mixed, the H+ ions from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the net reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles H+ = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28.

Moles OH- = 0.2.

So, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So, 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, none of them match exactly. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, -11.46 kJ is about -2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). So that would be about -2.74 kcal, which matches option A (-2.72 kcal), but that's in kcal. So why is the option given in kcal?

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, so 11.46 kJ is 2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is precise.

Wait, let me redo the calculations precisely.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 =0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, neutralization is 0.2 mol.

ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

If I convert this to kcal: 11.46 kJ /4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 2.738 kcal. So ΔH is approximately -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. However, wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.3 kJ. That seems way too large. So why is there an option with -11.42 kcal?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the moles. Let me see. Maybe the problem requires considering all the H+ and OH- from each solution, including any possible stoichiometric issues.

Wait, another thought: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole provides 2 H+. But in some cases, the second H+ isn't as strong, but for the purpose of neutralization, it's usually considered to fully dissociate in dilute solutions. So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and then see if any are left.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from base: 0.2 mol.

So, after reaction, 0.08 mol of H+ remains. The OH- is all used up.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 mol, giving -11.46 kJ.

But the options have D as -16.0 kJ. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects considering the reaction without considering stoichiometry, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So, H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol.

But the neutralization only uses 0.2 mol of H+.

So the calculation is correct, ΔH is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, none directly say -11.46 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, wait, wait—the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these three are mixed. Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which is a neutralization reaction that produces BaSO4 precipitate.

Wait a second, I think I missed that. Because when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they can form BaSO4, which precipitates. So perhaps the neutralization involves the reaction of H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2, but also, the sulfate and Ba^2+ ions form a precipitate.

Wait, but that complicates things. Because the neutralization would produce not just water, but also a salt. So, the enthalpy change for this reaction would be different.

So, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But wait, to balance it correctly:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, per mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, you get one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would include both the neutralization of the acid and the formation of the precipitate.

So, the enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat from H+ and OH- combining into water. But in this case, the reaction is a bit different because a precipitate is formed.

So, perhaps the total enthalpy change includes both the neutralization and the precipitation.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should find the overall reaction.

Let me list all the species:

HCl dissociates into H+ and Cl^-.

H2SO4 dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

When mixed, the H+ will react with OH^- to form water. Additionally, Ba^2+ and SO4^2- will form BaSO4 precipitate.

So, the reactions are:

1. H+ + OH^- → H2O (with enthalpy change of -57.3 kJ/mol H+)

2. Ba^2+ + SO4^2- → BaSO4(s) (precipitation, which is exothermic, but the exact value I'm not sure about.)

So, the total enthalpy change is the sum of the heat from the neutralization and the heat from the precipitation.

I think this is where I went wrong earlier. I only considered the neutralization, but the precipitation also releases heat.

Hmm, but I don't have the enthalpy change for the precipitation. So perhaps the question is only considering the neutralization part. Or perhaps it's expecting me to know that the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ regardless of the other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the only reaction considered is the H+ and OH- combining into water, ignoring any precipitate.

But without knowing the enthalpy change for the precipitation, I can't accurately calculate it. So perhaps the question assumes that only the neutralization reaction is considered.

So, going back to the original approach: 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, giving -11.46 kJ. So, looking at the options, which one is closest?

The options have D as -16.0 kJ. That's about 3.82 kcal (16 /4.184). Alternatively, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is 47.8 kJ. That's way higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing all the solutions and considering the total H+ and OH- available.

Wait, let's recalculate the total H+ and OH-:

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The OH- is limiting.

So, moles reacted = 0.2. Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 moles of OH-.

But I think I accounted for that already.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total H+ and OH- from all sources, including the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2, and seeing which is the limiting reactant.

Wait, but I did that already. Oh, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+. Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So, 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D (-16.0 kJ), which is larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Sometimes, it's given as -57 kJ/mol or -56.9 kJ/mol. So perhaps using 57.3 is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the total moles of H+ available, regardless of OH-.

Wait, that can't be, because the OH- is the limiting reagent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is calculating the neutralization for each acid separately, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

So, OH- is the limiting reagent. So, 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react.

So, enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at options, only option D is in kJ: -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in kcal, so let's compute that.

-11.46 kJ /4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -2.738 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.

But why is option B also in kcal but a much bigger number? Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.3 kJ, which doesn't match our calculation.

So perhaps the correct approach is to choose option A if the answer is in kcal, but the problem is giving a mix of units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value, say 4.18 kJ per mole of H+ (but that seems too low).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reaction in terms of per mole of H2SO4 or Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H2SO4, which is 2 mol H+ → 2*(-57.3) = -114.6 kJ/mol H2SO4.

But that complicates it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of acid or base. For example, HCl is 0.1 mol, H2SO4 is 0.09 mol, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol.

But I think the standard approach is to consider the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is not exactly any of the options. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is off, and option B is -11.42 kcal which is about -48.3 kJ. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to sum all the moles and proceed without considering which is limiting. But that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see if there's any excess, but that doesn't change the limiting reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid and base separately, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reaction between each acid and the base, but that's not how neutralization works when you mix all three.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the total H+ and OH- as if they all react, but that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: the total volume after mixing is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L. But I don't think that affects the moles calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like per mole of H2O formed. So, each mole of H2O releases 57.3 kJ. So, 0.2 mol would release 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So, the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the answer in kcal, so about -2.74 kcal. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm a bit confused because the options have different units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and assume they all react, but that would require more H+ than OH-.

Wait, but the OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So 0.28 -0.2 = 0.08 H+ remains. So, the neutralization is for 0.2 mol, giving -11.46 kJ.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and proceed, but that leads to a negative value.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the stoichiometry. Let me think again about the reaction.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+. Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per mole.

So, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

So, per mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized by 2 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but in this case, the moles of H2SO4 are 0.09 mol and Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So, the H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here. Because 1 mole H2SO4 requires 1 mole Ba(OH)2 (as per the balanced equation). But I have 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2.

Wait, no, because in the reaction, 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 1 mole BaSO4 and 2 H2O.

So, H2SO4 is 0.09 mol, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here.

So, all 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

That would consume 0.09 *2 = 0.18 mol H+ from H2SO4 and 0.09 *2 = 0.18 mol OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but then what about the HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2?

HCl is 0.1 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 initially is 0.1 mol, but 0.09 mol is used in the reaction with H2SO4. So, remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol → which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.02 mol.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol. OH- remaining is 0.02 mol.

So, 0.02 mol H+ and OH- will react, giving 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

So, total enthalpy change is from two parts:

1. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 mol reaction. Each reaction releases heat. What's the enthalpy for this reaction?

The enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is more complex. The standard neutralization enthalpy for a strong acid and strong base is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. But in this case, the reaction produces 2 moles of H2O per mole of H2SO4. So, per mole of H2SO4, the enthalpy change would be 2 * (-57.3) = -114.6 kJ.

So, for 0.09 mol H2SO4: 0.09 * (-114.6) = -10.314 kJ.

2. The reaction between HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol H+ and OH- react → 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -10.314 -1.146 = -11.46 kJ.

Which brings us back to the same value as before. So, the total enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D (-16.0 kJ), but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, which would be approximately -2.74 kcal, matching option A.

But wait, the problem includes HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The HCl will contribute H+ which can react with any remaining OH- after the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the correct way is to consider that the H2SO4 will react with Ba(OH)2 first, using up some of the OH-, and then the HCl will react with the remaining OH-.

So, in this case, the H2SO4 (0.09 mol) reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O, releasing 0.09 * (-114.6) = -10.314 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 mol → 0.02 mol OH-.

The HCl provides 0.1 mol H+. So, 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+ → 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -10.314 -1.146 = -11.46 kJ.

Which is the same as before.

So, the answer is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But none of the options have this. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the initial OH- is from Ba(OH)2, which is 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

H2SO4 is 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

So, in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, the moles of H+ from H2SO4 (0.18) and OH- (0.2) would determine the reaction.

So, which is the limiting reagent? H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18. OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting.

So, 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH- will react, producing 0.18 mol H2O. The enthalpy change is 0.18 * (-57.3) = -10.314 kJ.

The remaining OH- is 0.2 -0.18 = 0.02 mol.

Then, the HCl provides 0.1 mol H+. So, 0.02 mol OH- reacts, giving 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -10.314 -1.146 = -11.46 kJ.

Same as before.

So, the answer is -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. Since option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use 57 kJ/mol, leading to 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ, which is approximately option B (-11.42 kcal) if it's in kcal. But that would be a mistake because 11.4 kJ is not 11.4 kcal.

Wait, perhaps the options are mixed up. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.3 kJ. That's way higher than our calculation.

So, given the options, I think the correct choice is option D (-16.0 kJ) doesn't fit, but perhaps the intended answer is option B, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me check again.

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L =0.1 mol H+. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 mol → 0.18 H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 *0.2=0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-. Correct.

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. OH- is limiting.

So, 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So, I think the correct answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ, which isn't directly an option. But perhaps the closest option is not present. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, which would make it about -2.74 kcal, matching option A (-2.72 kcal).

But I'm confused because option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.3 kJ, which doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, like -56.9 kJ/mol. Let's recalculate:

0.2 * (-56.9) = -11.38 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

But again, the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total H+ from all acids and the OH- from all bases, but that leads to the same conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the HCl and only consider the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. Let's see:

H2SO4:0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2:0.1 mol →0.2 OH-.

So, 0.18 mol H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.18 reacts, leaving 0.02 OH-.

So, enthalpy change is 0.18 * (-57.3) = -10.314 kJ.

But this ignores the HCl, which would add another 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

Total is -11.46 kJ.

So, same result.

I think I've done everything I can. Given the options, the closest match in kJ is not present, but in kcal, option A is close. But perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ with a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → neutralizes with 0.1 mol OH- → but OH- is 0.2, so after HCl, 0.1 mol OH- remains.

Then, H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+ → neutralizes 0.18 OH-.

But OH- after HCl is 0.1, so H2SO4 can neutralize only 0.1 OH- → 0.1 H+ reacts, leaving 0.08 H+.

So, total neutralization is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.1 (H2SO4) = 0.2 mol.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Same result.

So, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D (-16.0 kJ), but I can't see how.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is using the formula for the enthalpy of neutralization as:

q = m * c * ΔT.

But without knowing the temperature change, that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ and OH- to react, but that's impossible because H+ is in excess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, so -11.46 kJ is about -2.74 kcal. So, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

But the options list option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.3 kJ, which is way off.

So, I think the intended answer is option D (-16.0 kJ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation and the correct answer is option B.

But given my calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is not listed. However, given the options, the closest in kJ isn't present, but in kcal it's option A (-2.72 kcal).

But I'm a bit stuck. Perhaps I should choose option D, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ from each acid:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so it contributes \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
     H⁺ = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it is present in smaller quantity.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
     Moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) that react = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57.3) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal if necessary:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This corresponds to \( -48.3 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far too large and inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** This corresponds to \( -16.2 \, \text{kJ} \), which is also inconsistent.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** This corresponds to \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \), which is larger than the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \) and does not match.

Given the calculations, the closest match is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, which aligns with the enthalpy change when converted to kcal.
