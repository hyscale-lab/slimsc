Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's recall what a pseudosphere is. I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. In the context of metrics, a pseudosphere would have a metric that represents this negative curvature.

Looking at the given metric:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for a hyperbolic space. I think the metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates has a similar form. The denominator is something like (R² - (x² + y²)), where R is related to the radius of curvature.

In this metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So if 4 is the square of the radius, then the radius R would be 2, because 2² is 4. So the radius r is 2, which matches the question's information.

Now, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, no, pseudosphere is a surface, but in the context of the metric given, which is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh wait, wait, no, the metric is for a two-dimensional surface, but the term pseudosphere is sometimes used in different contexts. Or maybe it's a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane, and the "pseudosphere" refers to the entire space's geometry.

I think I remember that the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite because as you go to infinity, the area keeps increasing. But that's for an infinite space. But wait, maybe the metric here is defined in a certain region, perhaps with a cutoff. Let's see the denominator: (4 - x² - y²) must be positive to have real values, so 4 - x² - y² >0 → x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Wait, but hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is usually represented as the upper half-plane or the unit disk, but this seems like a disk of radius 2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the metric as being a model for hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model has a metric ds² = (4/(R² - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius of the disk. Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so that would suggest R² is 4, so R=2. So this is indeed the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic plane with radius 2.

In that case, the metric here is representing a hyperbolic plane of curvature. Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but the term pseudosphere might be a bit confusing here. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-dimensional surface, and the area is being considered.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is different from the usual sphere. I think the area of a hyperbolic plane is actually infinite, but perhaps when considering a finite region, like up to a certain radius, the area can be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire pseudosphere, which would have infinite area. Or maybe, wait, maybe in this case, the metric is for a two-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. But I think the given metric itself is in two dimensions, so the space described is a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane.

So, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area. But wait, the metric only covers the disk of radius 2. Wait, but the Poincaré disk model covers the entire hyperbolic plane, but maps it to the disk of radius R (here R=2), but the actual area is still infinite because the metric's denominator approaches zero as you approach the boundary, leading to infinite length for any loop approaching the boundary.

Wait, no, the area isn't necessarily infinite in the disk model. Let me think again. The area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, but when you model it on the Poincaré disk, you're embedding it into a finite Euclidean space, but the area in the model is finite or infinite?

Wait, no, the area in the Poincaré disk model for the hyperbolic plane is actually finite for the entire space. Wait, no, the area is still infinite, because the area element is (4/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. So integrating over the entire disk (x² + y² <4) would give an infinite area.

Wait, let's compute the area. The area A is the integral over the region of the area element. The area element in this metric is dA = sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal with both (32)/(4 - x² - y²) terms, the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, no, the metric is given as ds² = (32/(4 -x^2 - y^2)) (dx² + dy²), which is diagonal with each component (32/(4 -x² -y²)).

So the determinant g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Then the area element is dA = sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area is the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Let's make a change of variables to polar coordinates, since the region is a circle. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes (4 - r²).

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr.

Let me compute this.

First, the θ integral is straightforward. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let's make a substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

A = 2π * ∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ]

Wait, let me see:

So ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u → 32*(-1/2) ∫ du/u → -16 ∫ du/u.

So the limits change from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0). So substituting:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is:

-16 ∫ (u=4 to 0) (1/u) du → -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So evaluating from u=4 to u=0:

= -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → -16 [ -infty ] → which is positive infinity.

So the integral becomes infinity.

Thus, the area A is 2π * (infinite) = infinity.

Wait, but this can't be right. Because when using the Poincaré disk model, the area up to a certain radius is finite for each finite radius. Or is the entire area still infinite?

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle of radius r grows exponentially with r. So as r approaches infinity, the area tends to infinity. But in the Poincaré disk model, the radius can't go beyond 2 in this case, because the denominator becomes zero at r=2.

Wait, no. Wait, the Poincaré disk model maps the entire hyperbolic plane into a finite disk. The coordinate system is such that the edge of the disk at r=2 corresponds to infinite distance in the hyperbolic plane. So when you integrate up to r=2, you're actually covering the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

So the area in this case would be infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere (which is the entire hyperbolic plane in this case) would be infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we analyze the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This metric represents a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk model, where the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) ensures the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a disk of radius 2. The curvature of the space is negative, and the pseudosphere refers to the entire hyperbolic plane embedded in this model.

To calculate the area, we compute the area element \( dA \), which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal with components \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element transforms to:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \) is straightforward. For the radial integral, we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The limits of integration change from \( r = 0 \) (\( u = 4 \)) to \( r = 2 \) (\( u = 0 \)), and the integral becomes:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = -16 \left[ \ln(u) \right]_4^0 = -16 \left[ \ln(0) - \ln(4) \right].
\]

As \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This result reflects the fact that the hyperbolic plane, represented by the pseudosphere, has infinite area. Thus, the correct answer is:
