Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. 

Alright, let's start by breaking down what's given. Both stars have the same mass, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things.

The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us.

So, for planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. I think the shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I vaguely recall is something like velocity equals (shift) multiplied by some constant, but I'm not sure. Wait, the shift is proportional to the velocity. So a larger shift means a higher velocity.

In the RV method, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by the formula K = (v) where v is the velocity. And K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The exact formula, I think, is K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2π) ) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i), but wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocities and the orbital periods.

Another approach: the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude of the star. The formula for K (semi-amplitude) is K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, the eccentricity e is probably negligible because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but since sin i is the same for both planets (assuming i is same, which the question doesn't specify, but I think in the absence of info, we can assume that inclination is similar or perhaps that the shifts are what's measured, so the sin i factor is part of the observed K, but given that both have same host stars, same M_*, same M_p, but different K, perhaps the ratio of K's can be used to find the ratio of P's.

Wait, but wait, the stars are the same mass. So M_* is same for both stars. The planets have same mass. So when we take the ratio of K1 and K2, the terms involving M_* and M_p should cancel out.

So K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). Because K ≈ (2πG/(P))^(1/3) * (M_p/(M_*^(2/3)) )

Wait, so K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 would be (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, the question says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for #2 it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7? Or is the shift proportional to K? Because the shift (in wavelength) is proportional to velocity. So yes, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the measured shift. So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But from above, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the period of #2 is shorter than #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1?

Wait, wait. No, the question is: how many times longer is P2's period than P1's. So P2 is 0.364 * P1, which is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364, so P2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means it's shorter, so the answer should be approximately 0.36. So looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't get it backwards. If K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1 < K2. From the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2 is less than P1, because K and P^(1/3) are inversely related. So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1, so planet #2's period is shorter. So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be P2/P1 multiplied by 100%, but since it's less, the multiple is 0.36 times. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times longer. So option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the relation right between K and P? Let me think again. The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) / ( (2π G)^1/3 P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P (1 - e²)) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so (1 - e²)=1. So,

K = [ (2 π G) / P )^(1/3) ] * [ M_p / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * sin i

Since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ [ (2 π G) / P )^(1/3) ] * [ M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) ] * sin i

But since both stars have same M_*, and both planets have same M_p, and assuming sin i is same (or that the shifts are as measured, so any differences in sin i would be part of the K value), so the ratio K1/K2 = [ ( (2π G)/P1 )^(1/3) ] / [ ( (2π G)/P2 )^(1/3) ]

Which simplifies to (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So 0.714 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1) → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's shorter. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer; it's shorter. So the ratio would be 0.364. But the options are about how many times longer, so the answer is 0.36 times as long, which is about 0.36 times. So the correct option is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is about 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). Using the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( P^{-1/3} \), assuming the stars and planets have similar masses and circular orbits. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto P^{-1/3}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the periods is related to the inverse cube of the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36 times. This corresponds to option A.
