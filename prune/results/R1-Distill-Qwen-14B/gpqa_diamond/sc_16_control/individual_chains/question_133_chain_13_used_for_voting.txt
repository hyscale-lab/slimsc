Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are phosphoric acid derivatives, right? Phosphoric acid has three dissociable protons, so it can donate H+ in three steps. The problem gives me the Ka values for each dissociation.

First, I think I should figure out the concentrations of each salt in the solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. Each salt contributes phosphate species when dissolved.

Let me jot down the formula for each salt:
- KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
- Na2HPO4·2H2O (I think the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+, HPO4^2-, and the water molecules probably just add to the solution as H2O.)

Wait, but when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it's Na2HPO4 plus two H2O molecules. So, in solution, it's 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt.

The problem states that each salt is 1.00 grams. So for KH2PO4, moles = mass / molar mass. The molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O, which has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005603 mol.

Wait, but each of these salts releases a phosphate species. KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-, which is HPO4^2- with an extra H+. Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

I remember that in solution, these can interconvert based on the pH. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, this is a buffer situation. The phosphate ions will exist in different forms depending on the pH, but since we're looking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H3PO4?), wait no. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely to be in one of its deprotonated forms.

Wait, the question asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to H3PO4. But wait, in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and tends to dissociate. So the actual concentration of H3PO4 might be very low. Hmm, but wait, maybe the problem is considering H2PO4^- as orthophosphate? Or perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4. Or maybe the term is used for the various species. Hmm, confusion arises.

Wait, let me think. Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. Then, each deprotonation gives a different form. So, in solution, the species would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this solution, we have KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-), and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which gives HPO4^2-.

So when these two are mixed, they can form a buffer solution because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become H3PO4, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become H2PO4^-, or accept a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH will be determined by the pKa values. Let's think about the relevant pKa.

The given Ka values are:
Ka1 = 7.5e-3 → pKa1 ≈ 2.12
Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈ 7.21
Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 ≈ 11.74

Wait, because the second dissociation is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. So the pKa2 is around 7.21. Since the pH of the solution isn't given, but the problem is at 25°C, which is neutral pH, but I think the pH of the solution is determined by the buffer.

Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are conjugate acid-base pairs with pKa2, the pH should be around pKa2. So the buffer is around pH 7.21.

But we're asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm, I think orthophosphate refers to H3PO4. But wait, in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and would have a low concentration because it dissociates. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the sum of all phosphate species, but I think no, because the options are in the 1e-7 range, which is lower than concentrations from the salts.

Wait, but maybe the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? No, that's the dihydrogen phosphate. Or maybe it's the sum of all the phosphate species, but that would be the total phosphate concentration, which would be the sum of all the ions from both salts.

Wait, let me re-read the question.

"What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?"

Orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and will dissociate into H+ and H2PO4^-.

But in a solution where H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the H3PO4 concentration is probably very low. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the total concentration of all phosphate species, including H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, but that can't be. The options are around 1e-7 M, which is lower than the initial concentrations. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate ion), but that's unlikely because PO4^3- is a very weak acid and would have a very low concentration.

Wait, perhaps there's a confusion here. Let me clarify:

Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses three protons, it becomes PO4^3-.

But in the solution, we have KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which gives HPO4^2-). So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species.

Wait, but orthophosphate usually refers to the H3PO4 molecule, but in solution, it's mostly dissociated. So the concentration of H3PO4 might be very low.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-? But that's one of the ions we're adding.

Wait, maybe not. Another approach is to think about the phosphate species. Since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around pKa2 (7.21). So the concentration of H3PO4 would be determined by the first dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? No, that's the hydrogen phosphate ion. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe I should think about the solution in terms of the buffer. So the buffer is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- with a pKa2 of ~7.21. The initial concentrations of these two ions are determined by the moles of the salts.

Wait, but the solution volume is 200 cm³, so 0.2 L.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol. So concentration is 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005603 mol. So concentration is 0.005603 / 0.2 = 0.028015 M of HPO4^2-.

So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution are 0.03668 M and 0.028015 M, respectively.

Now, because this is a buffer solution, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the numbers:

pH = 7.21 + log(0.028015 / 0.03668) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.21 - 0.115 ≈ 7.095.

So the pH is about 7.1.

Now, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, if orthophosphate is H3PO4, then we can find its concentration using the first dissociation.

Ka1 is 7.5e-3, which is for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-.

So the expression is Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4].

We can rearrange this to [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1.

We know [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M, and [H+] can be found from the pH we calculated. pH is 7.1, so [H+] = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So plugging these in:

[H3PO4] = (7.94e-8) * 0.03668 / (7.5e-3)

Calculate numerator: 7.94e-8 * 0.03668 ≈ 2.923e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 2.923e-9 / 7.5e-3 ≈ 3.897e-7 M.

That's approximately 3.90e-7 M. Looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M, which is very close to this value.

But wait a second, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check.

Wait, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around 7.1. Using that pH, I found [H3PO4] by using the first dissociation.

But another thought: Could the presence of HPO4^2- affect the concentration of H3PO4? Because HPO4^2- can act as a base and take a proton from H2PO4^- to form H3PO4. Or is that already accounted for in the buffer calculation?

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH based on the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^-. So the concentrations of these two species are fixed by the buffer. The H3PO4 comes from the H2PO4^- accepting a proton, but in reality, the pH will determine how much H2PO4^- is protonated to H3PO4.

Wait, but no, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4, so the concentration of H3PO4 can be found using the first dissociation.

So the calculation I did earlier should be correct. Hence, the concentration is approximately 3.9e-7 M, so the closest option is D) 3.97e-7 M.

But wait, let's go through the math again to be precise.

Calculating moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.0073358 mol → 0.036679 M in 0.2 L.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005603 mol → 0.028015 M in 0.2 L.

Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → Wait, no, pKa2 is -log(Ka2). Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = about 7.21.

So pH = 7.21 + log(0.028015 / 0.036679) → compute the ratio: 0.028015 / 0.036679 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈ -0.115 → pH = 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.

So [H+] = 10^-7.095 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

Now, [H3PO4] = ([H+][H2PO4^-])/Ka1.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036679 M.

So [H3PO4] = (7.94e-8 * 0.036679) / 7.5e-3.

Compute numerator: 7.94e-8 * 0.036679 ≈ 2.922e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3 → 2.922e-9 / 7.5e-3 = (2.922 / 7.5) * 1e-6 → approximately 0.3896 * 1e-6 → 3.896e-7 M.

So approximately 3.896e-7 M. The options are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

So my calculation gives ~3.896e-7, which is very close to option D (3.97e-7). The slight discrepancy is probably due to more precise calculations.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H₃PO₄) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, with molar masses of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹², corresponding to pKa₁ ≈ 2.12, pKa₂ ≈ 7.21, and pKa₃ ≈ 11.74.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \), so its concentration in 0.2 L is \( \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M} \) of \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \).
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005603 \, \text{mol} \), so its concentration in 0.2 L is \( \frac{0.005603}{0.2} \approx 0.02802 \, \text{M} \) of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \).

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
The buffer consists of \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \), which are conjugate acid-base pairs with pKa₂ ≈ 7.21. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log \left( \frac{0.02802}{0.03668} \right) \approx 7.21 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.21 - 0.115 \approx 7.095
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately 7.095, and the hydrogen ion concentration is \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-7.095} \approx 7.94 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of H₃PO₄
Orthophosphate (H₃PO₄) is the fully protonated form of phosphoric acid. Its concentration can be determined using the first dissociation constant:

\[
\text{Ka}_1 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}{[\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4]}
\]

Rearranging for \( [\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4] \):

\[
[\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4] = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}{\text{Ka}_1}
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 7.94 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \),
- \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = 0.03668 \, \text{M} \),
- \( \text{Ka}_1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \).

\[
[\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4] = \frac{(7.94 \times 10^{-8})(0.03668)}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx \frac{2.922 \times 10^{-9}}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 3.896 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 \) is approximately \( 3.896 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option D \( 3.97 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

Answer: D
