Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in different units, so I'll have to be careful with that.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But here, maybe the reaction isn't just one mole because of the different acids and bases involved.

Let me break down each solution's moles. I remember that moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Starting with HCl. It's a strong acid, so each mole contributes one H+ ion. The volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. That gives 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and it's diprotic, so each mole gives two H+ ions. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Each mole gives two OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, adding up all H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here would be whichever is less between H+ and OH-. Oh wait, H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting factor. That means all OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait. The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. Since HCl is a stronger acid, or at least a monoprotic one, maybe it's the first to react. But the problem might just consider total H+ and OH- for the net reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction will proceed until either acid or base is exhausted. So the available OH- is 0.2; H+ is 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

The excess H+ will be 0.08 moles (0.28 - 0.2). But wait, some of the H+ comes from H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid. Once the first H+ is neutralized, the second H+ might not be neutralized as much, but since the base is insufficient to neutralize all H+, perhaps that's the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization involves all the OH- but some of the H+.

So the mole of H+ neutralized is 0.2. Each mole of H+ and OH- forming water releases enthalpy. The standard enthalpy for neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole, but since it's per mole of H+ and OH- reacting, each mole releases that amount.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically measured per mole of acid reacting as a strong acid. For HCl, it's one mole per mole of H+; for H2SO4, it's two moles of H+ per mole of H2SO4. But when you have a mix of acids and a base, it's the total H+ and OH- that matter, but the stoichiometry can get tricky.

Wait, maybe the total moles of H+ and OH- will give the net moles of H+ remaining. Because, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the amount of H+ that reacts is the minimum of H+ and OH- moles.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all OH- reacts, 0.2 H+ reacts, leaving 0.08 H+.

But wait, the neutralization releases heat. The total heat released would be based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. So for each mole reacting, it's about -57 kJ. Or wait, is it -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed? Because each mole of H+ and OH- makes one mole of H2O. So 0.2 moles reacting → 0.2 moles H2O, so heat is 0.2 × (-57 kJ). But wait, no, because some H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The net reaction will involve the available H+ and OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- is 0.2.

So, the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The moles would be limited by OH-. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but wait. The actual value might be a bit different because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and perhaps the second H+ isn't as strong, but in the case of strong acids and bases, I think they are considered fully ionized.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is per mole of H+ reacting. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, then the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11400 J or -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but I calculated in kJ, so I need to convert.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the total in terms of kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol or about -13.8 kcal/mol (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). Let me check: 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal (because 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6).

So, if each mole of H+ contributes -13.6 kcal, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Hmm, so that's -2.72 kcal, which is option A. But wait, earlier calculation in kJ was -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 ×4.184≈-11.4, but wait, no.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 0.2 moles reacting. Each mole releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ released, so -11.4 kJ. But the options have some in kcal and some in kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option A: -2.72 kcal.

Option B: -11.42 kcal.

Option C: -3.80 kcal.

Option D: -16.0 kJ.

Wait, I need to check which unit the problem expects. The question says "enthalpy of neutralization", which is usually given per mole in kJ or kcal. But the options have both units, so I need to compute which one is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, 11.4 kJ is equal to 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, if 0.2 moles react, the enthalpy would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. The calculation depends on the correct approach.

Alternative approach: The total H+ from HCl is 0.1, H2SO4 is 0.18, and Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The OH- is 0.2 moles, which will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+. So the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ are used, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08), but that's not directly relevant unless we're calculating excess.

Now, the enthalpy change is for the neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+ and OH-.

So, each mole gives off 57 kJ, so 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ (exothermic).

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So, which is it?

Wait, let me double-check the standard enthalpy. The standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually about -57 kJ per mole of acid (monoprotic) reacting, which is equivalent to about -13.6 kcal per mole. Because 57 kJ is roughly 13.6 kcal. So, for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ, or about -13.6 kcal.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So, using kJ: 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is option D, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. The problem also includes H2SO4, which is diprotic. So maybe each mole contributes two H+ ions, each releasing about -57 kJ. So, for each H+ from H2SO4, it's another -57 kJ. So, maybe I should calculate each acid separately.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach it is to find the moles of H+ from each acid and see how much reacts with the OH-.

So, HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, the OH- will neutralize H+ in the order of availability.

Wait, but perhaps the OH- will first neutralize H+ from the strongest acid? No, in solution, all H+ is available. So the OH- will neutralize H+ regardless of the source.

So, the total H+ available is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So, all OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 H+.

So, the moles of H+ used is 0.2, which comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

Which means, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which in kJ is about -11.4 ×4.184≈-47.6 kJ? Wait, no. Wait, no, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ, so to convert kJ to kcal, divide by 4.184.

So, -11.4 kJ is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So, that would match option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is there an option B of -11.42 kcal? That would be if the calculation was done in kcal. Let me recalculate.

If the enthalpy per mole is -13.6 kcal per mole (since 57 kJ ≈13.6 kcal), then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. So that's option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of exact conversion. Let's compute 57,000 J per mole (57 kJ) into kcal.

57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.6 kcal. So, 0.2 moles ×13.6 ≈ 2.72 kcal, so -2.72. Hence, option A.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps when H2SO4 is present, each H+ contributes. So, the total H+ is 0.28, but only 0.2 reacts. So, the heat released is 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So, the correct answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. That would be about 47.6 kJ (11.42 ×4.184≈47.6), which doesn't match my 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I considered only one H+ from H2SO4, but perhaps someone might think both H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized.

Wait, let me think again. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in strong acid conditions, both H+ are fully ionized. However, when neutralizing, the first H+ is neutralized by the OH-.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles. So, the first H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 moles (since H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per mole). Wait no, H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per mole. So total H+ is 0.18.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline:

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 ×2=0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ =0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So, OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

Which acid's H+ is neutralized first? Since HCl is a monoprotic acid and H2SO4 is diprotic, perhaps the H+ comes from both, but the neutralization is based on moles.

So, regardless of the source, 0.2 H+ neutralized → 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×57 kJ=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, in kcal, -11.4 /4.184 ≈-2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility is that the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each mole gives two OH-, so perhaps the neutralization requires two H+ per Ba(OH)2. But no, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, so each H+ and OH- pair makes one water molecule.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the heat for each acid and base separately.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because they are all mixed together. So it's a single reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the individual neutralization reactions and summing them. But that approach might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL ×0.2 M =0.5 L ×0.2 =0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL ×0.3 M=0.3 L ×0.3 =0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL ×0.5 M=0.2 L ×0.5=0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 ×2=0.2 OH-.

So moles of H+ =0.28, moles OH-=0.2.

So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles reacting: 0.2.

So, the heat is 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11400 J is 11.4 kJ; 11.4 /4.184≈2.72).

So, the answer should be option A, -2.72 kcal.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise conversion.

1 kcal = 4184 J.

So, 57,000 J is 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles ×13.6 kcal/mol = 2.72 kcal. So, the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal.

Which is option A.

But why option B is -11.42 kcal? That would correspond to 11.42 ×4184 ≈47.6 kJ, which is not matching 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction.

Wait, let's think about the neutralization of H2SO4. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, maybe each mole contributes two H+ and each of those reacts, but in reality, the OH- is limited, so perhaps only the first H+ of H2SO4 is neutralized.

Wait, but that's getting into more detailed acid-base behavior.

Wait, the neutralization reaction for H2SO4 would first react with OH- to form HSO4^-.

H+ (from H2SO4) + OH- → H2O.

So, the first H+ is neutralized, and the second H+ remains. So, in our case, the OH- is 0.2 moles.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1, H2SO4:0.18 → total 0.28.

OH-:0.2.

So, all 0.2 OH- would neutralize 0.2 H+.

Which H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4? It doesn't matter for the stoichiometry.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ.

Which is approximately 2.72 kcal.

So, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but in the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the moles.

Alternative approach: Let's recalculate the moles again.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L =0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL=0.3 L. 0.3 L ×0.3 =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L. 0.2 L ×0.5=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ =0.1+0.18=0.28.

OH- =0.2.

So, the neutralization consumes 0.2 H+.

So, heat is 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

Which is option D: -16.0 kJ? No, option D is -16 kJ.

Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I miscalculate the moles again?

Wait, perhaps the molarity for Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So, 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

That's correct.

HCl: 0.5 L ×0.2 =0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3=0.09 H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

So, total H+ is 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So, 0.2 H+ neutralized.

So, 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ. So, the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.6 kJ, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting to consider the molarity multiplied by the volume properly.

Wait, let me check the volumes again.

HCl: 500 mL → 0.5 L.

H2SO4: 300 mL →0.3 L.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL →0.2 L.

So, moles are correct.

Alternative thought: Could the problem be using the formula for enthalpy change as q = m × c × ΔT? No, because the problem doesn't provide any data about temperature change, so it's impossible to calculate it that way. It must be using the moles and standard enthalpy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in terms of kJ, and the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B)-11.42 kcal, C)-3.80 kcal, D)-16.0 kJ.

So, the closest in kJ is option D, -16 kJ, but that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the H2SO4 is diprotic, so when it's mixed with a strong base, the first H+ is fully neutralized, and the second H+ may not react as much, but in this case, the OH- is insufficient to neutralize all the H+.

Wait, but that doesn't change the total H+ available. So, the calculation remains the same.

I think I've gone through all possibilities. The correct answer should be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine limiting reagent:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in fewer moles than H⁺.

3. **Calculate moles of H⁺ neutralized:**
   - All 0.2 moles of OH⁻ will react with 0.2 moles of H⁺, forming 0.2 moles of water.

4. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   - For 0.2 moles of H⁺ neutralized:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Match with options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) corresponds to an incorrect conversion or miscalculation.  
   - Option C (\( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \)) is unrelated to the calculation.  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
