Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, a larger parallax means a closer star. Wait, no, wait. Actually, smaller parallax corresponds to greater distance. Because the closer the star, the larger the parallax shift. Oh right, so plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—so the number density of stars is uniform. But wait, does that mean uniform in space or on the sky's surface? Hmm, the wording says uniformly distributed in the sky, which might imply uniform in terms of their spatial distribution. So, like, same number per volume as you go outward.

Wait, but how does parallax relate to distance and volume? Let's think. Parallax plx is 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So as d increases, plx decreases.

So, if we have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? d = 1/plx, so the distance range would be from d to d + dd. What's dd in terms of dplx?

Let me compute. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. Hmm, but that's a negative; maybe I should think in absolute terms, so the distance interval is proportional to dplx / plx^2. Or wait, maybe I can express d in terms of plx and find the number of stars in a given plx shell.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so n(r) dr = number of stars between r and r+dr. Since the distribution is uniform, n(r) is constant, say n0. So the number of stars in a thin shell (between r and r+dr) is 4π r² n0 dr.

But we want the number per unit plx. So I need to relate dr to dplx. Because plx = 1/r, so dplx = - (1/r²) dr. Or, dr = - r² dplx. Since r = 1/plx, substituting, dr = - (1/plx)^2 dplx.

Wait, but integrating from a larger r to a smaller r would give a negative, so perhaps I should take the absolute value. Let's see, the number of stars in a plx range from plx to plx + dplx would correspond to a distance from r = 1/plx down to 1/(plx + dplx), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of a small dplx, so that the change is from plx to plx + dplx, with dplx positive meaning a larger parallax (which is a closer star). Wait, but in reality, higher plx means closer, so higher plx is a smaller distance.

So, perhaps the number of stars in a dplx range is the same as the number in the corresponding dr range. So, number of stars = n0 * 4π r² dr.

But dr = (d r / d plx) d plx.

Since r = 1/plx, dr/d plx = -1/(plx^2). So dr = (-1/plx^2) d plx.

But since d plx is a small positive number, dr would be negative (because as plx increases, r decreases). So the number of stars in a plx interval dplx would be:

number = 4π r² n0 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 n0 * (-1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, but since we're integrating over a positive dplx, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So the magnitude would be:

number = 4π (1/plx²) * n0 * (1/plx²) * dplx.

Wait, that makes the number proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. So the number per unit plx would be 4π n0 (1/plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx interval (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4?

Wait, but that would be option A, which is ~ 1/plx^4. But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell with radius r and thickness dr. The volume is 4π r² dr. The number of stars is n0 * 4π r² dr.

Now, r = 1/plx. So dr = (dr/d plx) d plx. Since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx → |dr| = (1/plx²) d plx.

So the number of stars in a plx interval d plx is n0 * 4π r² * |dr|.

Substituting r = 1/plx:

n0 *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx = n0 *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number density in plx space is 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4, which matches option A.

Wait, but that seems steeper than I remember. Wait, another way: If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then number per volume is constant. So the number in a shell at radius r is proportional to r² dr. But when you plot this as a function of plx, which is 1/r, dr is proportional to d(1/r) = - (1/r²) dr → so d plx = - (1/r²) dr → dr = - r² d plx.

Wait, plugging that into the number of stars in a shell:

n = 4π r² dr = 4π r² (- r² d plx) → 4π r^4 (-d plx). But since d plx is positive, maybe I should take absolute values, so n =4 π r^4 d plx.

But r =1/plx, so r^4 = (1/plx)^4 → n =4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So again, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A is correct.

Wait, but another approach: Let's think about the solid angle. No, perhaps not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is between number per unit volume and number per unit plx. Let me think again.

If the number density of stars is n (number per cubic parsec) and uniform, then the number in a shell between r and r+dr is 4π r² dr *n.

But since plx = 1/r, dr = - d plx / (plx^2) → 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx^2) ) *n.

Which is 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So again, it's 1/plx^4.

Hmm. So all these approaches lead me to option A, which is 1/plx^4.

But wait, wait a second. Another thought: Could the distribution be uniform in the sky as in, same number per unit area on the celestial sphere? That would be a different scenario. Because if stars are uniformly distributed on the sky (same number per solid angle), then that's different from being uniformly distributed in space.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform, regardless of distance? Or does it mean that their spatial density is uniform (same number per volume regardless of where you are in space)?

If it's the former (uniformly distributed on the sky, meaning same number per unit solid angle), then the problem is different. But the way the question is phrased, I think it's the spatial distribution that's uniform. Because if they were uniformly distributed on the sky (i.e., same number per solid angle), then their distances would vary, and the number per unit plx would depend on how their distances are distributed.

But the question asks about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So I think the correct approach is that the number of stars in a given plx range depends on how much volume corresponds to that plx range.

Wait, another thought: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is 4π r² dr *n. So the number per unit plx is (4π r² dr n )/ (d plx). But dr = - (1/plx^2) d plx. So substituting, we have:

(4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) d plx * n ) / d plx.

Wait, but the d plx cancels out, so we get 4π n (-1/plx^4).

But since we are considering absolute values, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, I think option A is correct.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance, and vice versa.

The question assumes that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n_0 \)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell and the number density: 

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n_0 \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr.
\]

To relate this to parallax, we note that \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Differentiating \( r \) with respect to plx gives:

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the expression for the number of stars, we get:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n_0 \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Taking the absolute value (since \( d\text{plx} \) is positive), the number of stars per unit range of plx becomes:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.
