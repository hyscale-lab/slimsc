Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Hmm. I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and relate to the field strength tensor in some way.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I think I should figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions, since it's integrated over four dimensions, and the action should be dimensionless.

Wait, the Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4, right. Because when you integrate it over d^4x (which has dimension -4 in mass units since each x is [mass]^{-1}), the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4.

So each term in L_int must have mass dimension 4. So let's break down each part of the term κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

What are the dimensions of ψ (the Dirac spinor)? I remember that for a Dirac spinor in 4D, the dimension is [mass]^{3/2}. Because the Dirac equation is (iD - m)ψ = 0. The covariant derivative D has dimension 1, same as derivative, so the term iDψ has dimension [ψ] + 1. The mass term mψ would have dimension [ψ] + 0 (since m is [mass] = [energy] = [inverse length] = [inverse mass]^{-1} ??? Wait, no, mass is energy and has units of [energy] = [mass] * [velocity]^2, but in natural units where c=1, E and mass are the same. But in terms of units, in four dimensions, fields have certain dimensions.

Wait, in 4 dimensions, the field ψ has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. Because for a spinor field, the dimension is (d-1)/2 where d is the spacetime dimension. So in 4D, [ψ] = 3/2.

Now, looking at each part:

- \bar{ψ} has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

- σ_{μν} is a matrix (or rather, a tensor made of γ matrices). Since each γ matrix is dimensionless (they're just matrices, not operators), σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. What's its dimension? Well, F is the field tensor for electromagnetism, which is a U(1) gauge field. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1 in four dimensions. The field strength F_{mu nu} is the derivative of A, so each derivative brings a dimension of 1. So F has dimension 2? Because F_{mu nu} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, and each ∂ has dimension 1. So [F^{mu nu}] = [A] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1. The derivative ∂_mu has dimension 1. So F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each term is [∂][A] = 1 * 1 = 1. Oh wait, no, that would make F have dimension 1? Or wait, no, because A has dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂ A, which is [1] * [1] = [1]. So F has dimension 1?

Wait, maybe I should think about the Maxwell Lagrangian. The Maxwell term is F_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}, which in 4D has dimension 4 because each F has dimension 2. Oh wait, no. Each F has dimension 2, so F^2 has dimension 4. So the Maxwell term is dimension 4, correct because the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

So if F^2 is 4, then each F must be 2. Because 2 + 2 =4. So yes, [F] = 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through this again. The field strength tensor F_{μν} is derived from the potential A_μ. The expression is F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A_μ has dimension 1. Each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so each term in F is [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So F_{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, but in 4D, the Maxwell Lagrangian is (F_{μν})^2, which has dimension 4. Because (2) * (2) =4. So that makes sense. So F has dimension 2.

So going back to our term. Let's count dimensions:

The term is κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So \bar{ψ} times ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

σ is dimensionless, so it doesn't contribute.

F has dimension 2.

So the product \bar{ψ} σ ψ F has dimensions 3 + 2 =5.

The Lagrangian term has to have dimension 4. So the entire term is κ * (something with dimension 5), and this must equal dimension 4.

So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait. No, because the term is (κ) multiplied by that 5-dimensional thing. So the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. So,

[κ] + [ \bar{ψ} σ ψ F ] = 4

We have [ \bar{ψ} σ ψ F ] = (3/2 + 3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5?

Wait, no, wait: in each term, I think the dimensions are additive. Let me retrace:

Each ψ is 3/2, so \bar{ψ} is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. So \bar{ψ}ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 =3. Then F is 2. So \bar{ψ} σ ψ F would be 3 + 2 =5.

So the entire term, including κ, is [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] must be -1.

Yes, so the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant's dimension. For a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, renormalizable theories have terms in the Lagrangian with dimension ≤4. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, then the term is nonrenormalizable.

Because in the power counting for renormalizability, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. The coupling constants' dimension must be such that when multiplied by the fields, the term doesn't exceed dimension 4.

Wait, but in this case, the term is already dimension 4, because the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So the term is dimension 4, but the coupling has dimension -1.

Wait, but that term is allowed, but the theory's renormalizability would depend on the overall structure. Wait, the theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have positive mass dimension, or at least non-negative? Or I think that the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥ - (d-4)/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. Or perhaps more accurately, in four dimensions, the coupling must have dimension ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable.

Wait, no, because for each term in the Lagrangian, the dimension is 4. So each term is like (coupling) * (field terms). Each term must have dimension ≤4 (because the term itself is part of the Lagrangian, which is dimension 4). So the field terms contribute their own dimensions, and the coupling must have the right dimension to make the product dimension 4.

In our case, the term is dimension 4. So the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is lower than zero. That suggests that the term is nonrenormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension.

Wait, but wait, the term itself is allowed because the overall term has correct dimension. But for renormalizability, the theory must have only a finite number of terms. If the coupling has a negative mass dimension (i.e., negative when considering the number of fields), then higher-order terms (like higher powers of the fields) would have lower dimensions, which might require higher-order couplings to have even more negative dimensions, leading to an infinite number of terms and making the theory nonrenormalizable.

Alternatively, the general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0 in four dimensions. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, then the corresponding interaction term is nonrenormalizable, leading to an effective theory with a cutoff scale.

In this case, κ has dimension -1. So the theory would be nonrenormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. So the options are, which one says that κ has dimension -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Option A) [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. No, that's not right.

Option D) [κ]=1, theory not renormalizable. No, because we found [κ]=-1.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor. 

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density in four spacetime dimensions must have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the dimensions of each term in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$ in 4D.
- $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, so $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of $\gamma$ matrices, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$ (dimension 1) via derivatives (dimension 1).

The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following total dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. Nonrenormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms and are typically effective theories valid only below a certain energy scale (the cutoff scale).

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
