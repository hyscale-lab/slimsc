Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I misread that. Let me look again. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like λ times the fermion fields multiplied by the boson X. So the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermions must be a pair, like a particle and its antiparticle. Because the interaction term seems to involve ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The key thing here is the mass of X. The boson's mass is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the decay products' rest masses must be less than the parent particle's mass.

Wait, but also, each fermion must have a rest mass less than 3 GeV, because each fermion and antifermion would each have mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. 

Quarks come in different flavors. Let's list their masses (approximate, in GeV):

- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV → negligible compared to 3 GeV.
- Down (d): around 4.7 MeV → same.
- Strange (s): around 95 MeV → way below.
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV.
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*173 >>6 GeV.

Leptons:

- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos: almost zero mass, so they can be produced.

So the fermions with mass ≤3 GeV are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c. Wait, c is 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3, so okay. But bottom is 4.5, so X can't decay into b or t quarks.

Wait, but wait. The decay is X → f f-bar. So for each f, the mass m_f must satisfy m_f ≤ M_X / 2. So M_X is 6 GeV, so m_f must be ≤3 GeV.

So for quarks: the possible f are u, d, s, c. Because their masses are all below 3 GeV. But wait, the top quark is way too heavy, and the bottom is 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b or t quarks.

But wait, the problem options include some of these.

Wait, but perhaps I should also consider if the fermions are charged leptons. For example, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 1.78 * 2 is 3.56, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be a decay product.

Wait, wait. Wait, let me clarify: if the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, then any fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion has to be ≤3 GeV.

Tau is about 1.78 GeV each. So two taus would be 3.56 GeV. That's under 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Similarly, muons are 0.105 GeV each. So two muons would be 0.21 GeV, way under 6 GeV. Electrons are even lighter.

So possible fermion pairs are: u, d, s, c, tau, and muon, electron.

Wait, but wait: the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the interaction term. Let me parse it again.

Wait, the original interaction term is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Maybe it's written as L = -λ (ψ_f(y) X(y) ψ_f(y)), but I think perhaps the interaction is something like λ (X(y) ψ_f(y) ψ_f(y)), which would be a Yukawa coupling. Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps that term is the Yukawa interaction where X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f. So the coupling is between X and two fermions of the same type. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

So from the fermion masses:

Leptons:
- e: 0.511 MeV → allowed
- μ: 105.7 MeV → allowed
- τ: 1.78 GeV → allowed (each, so two would be 3.56 GeV <6 GeV)
Wait, 1.78 *2 = 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6 yes.

Quarks:
- u: ~2.2 MeV → yes
- d: ~4.7 MeV → yes
- s: ~95 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes (each, so 3 GeV total)
But wait, 1.5*2=3 GeV, so exactly 3 GeV. So allowed.

But for b quark, 4.5 GeV each → 9 GeV total, which is way over 6 GeV. So not allowed.

Top quark is even heavier, so no.

So the possible decay products are the fermions whose mass is ≤3 GeV. So u, d, s, c quarks, and tau, mu, e leptons.

Wait, but wait! Wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

So X can decay into:

uū, dd, ss, cc, ττ̄, μμ̄, ee.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? Because 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b b̄. Same for top—way too heavy.

So the possible decay products are the light quarks (u, d, s, c), tau, muon, and electron.

Now looking at the options.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄ because 2*4.5=9 GeV>6. So option A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

This includes c, which is okay (as 1.5 GeV each, 3 GeV total), and the leptons. So this is a possible option.

Option C: includes top quarks. So it's wrong.

Option D: includes b and tau, but not c. Wait, option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait, in option B, the fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

Option D: includes b as a decay product, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the allowed decays are the ones in option B.

Wait, but wait, in the given Lagrangian, is there any reason why, say, charged leptons are more likely? Or are all possible fermions considered?

Wait, the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so it's perhaps a Yukawa coupling where X couples to all possible fermions. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

So in the options, the correct one is B, which includes all the allowed fermions except for b and t.

Wait, but looking again at the options:

Option B is: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian and the mass of \( X \), which is \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). The interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), where the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq \frac{M_X}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total mass of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \).

### Fermion Masses
The approximate masses of fermions (in GeV) are:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \)  
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)  

From this, the fermions with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, \tau, \mu, e \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because their masses are too large (\( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Decay Channels
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \). All these decay channels are allowed. This option is correct.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
