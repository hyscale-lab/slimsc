Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, the operator P acting on the eigenvector should give me (ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. I think each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the overall operator P, which is a vector operator, would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of n with the vector operator P. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That implies that the y-component of n is zero. So, n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, maybe it's represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) where θ is the angle from the x-axis. Or wait, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the direction can be represented with polar angles where the angle φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane, so φ is the azimuthal angle, right? So, maybe θ is the angle from the z-axis, but I'm a bit confused about the convention here. Alternatively, perhaps θ is the angle from the x-axis, so that in the x-z plane, any direction can be represented by an angle θ varying from 0 to π/2. Hmm, not sure, but I'll proceed.

So, the operator P along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y =0 so the P_y term drops out.

Each P component is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly for P_y and P_z. So,

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P in the n direction is n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z. Let me write that out.

P = (n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So, the matrix inside is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because the first term has 0 and 1, the second term has n_z and -n_z on the diagonal. So, adding them:

First row: (n_z *1, n_x *1)
Second row: (n_x *1, (-n_z)*1 )

So the matrix becomes [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by (ħ/2).

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So, (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Substituting P:

( (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ) - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

Factor out (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) [ [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]] ] |v> = 0.

Since ħ/2 is non-zero, the matrix part must annihilate the vector. So, the matrix equation is:

[[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]] |v> = 0.

Let me write this matrix:

M = [[n_z -1, n_x],
     [n_x, -n_z -1]]

We need to find non-trivial solutions to M v = 0.

The determinant of M must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let's compute the determinant:

det(M) = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Multiply it out:

= (-n_z(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1)) ) - n_x^2
Wait, perhaps expand it as:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -(n_z -1)(n_z +1)
= -(n_z^2 -1) = -n_z^2 +1.

So, det(M) = (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2.

But since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because n is a unit vector), let's substitute n_x² =1 -n_z².

So, det(M) = (-n_z^2 +1) - (1 -n_z^2) )= (-n_z^2 +1) -1 +n_z^2 = 0.

So, the determinant is zero, which confirms that there's a non-trivial solution, as expected.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can solve M v =0.

Take the first row: (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0.

So, (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2.

Let me write v2 in terms of v1: v2 = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] v1.

But since we're looking for any eigenvector, we can set v1 = 1 (or any non-zero scalar multiple). So then v2 = (1 -n_z)/n_x.

Wait, but we need to ensure that the vector is normalized. But the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, so we'll have to normalize at the end.

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenvector can be written as (v1, v2) = (1, (1 -n_z)/n_x ), up to a scalar factor.

But wait, let's make sure that this is correct. Let me recheck.

From the first equation, (n_z -1)v1 +n_x v2 =0.

Rearranged: n_x v2 = (1 - n_z) v1.

So, v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to (v1, v2) = (1, (1-n_z)/(n_x) ).

But since n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²), assuming n_x is positive (since in some cases, n_x could be negative, but perhaps we can take it positive for simplicity, as direction is arbitrary, and we can adjust the sign).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express n_x in terms of an angle. Let me represent n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), which is a common convention where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, wait: in the standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle measured from the positive z-axis, so n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But here, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is zero or π, so n_y =0. So, for simplicity, let's say φ=0, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substitute n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Then, the eigenvector components are:

v1 = 1,

v2 = (1 - cosθ) / sinθ.

Which can be simplified using trigonometric identities.

We know that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2),

and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, v2 = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = sin(θ/2)/(cos(θ/2)) ) = tan(θ/2).

So, the components are (1, tan(θ/2) ).

But we can write this as (1, tan(θ/2) ) multiplied by some normalization factor.

Alternatively, let's factor out cos(θ/2) to express the components in terms of sine and cosine.

Wait, perhaps another approach: express the eigenvector in terms of θ/2.

Let me think: (1, tan(θ/2)) can be written as cos(θ/2) (1, sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) ) ) = cos(θ/2) (1, tan(θ/2) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the components as (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), but that depends on the angle.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

So, from earlier steps, the eigenvector is:

(1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ )

= (1, [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] )

= (1, [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] )

= (1, tan(θ/2) )

So, the components are 1 and tan(theta/2).

Now, to find the normalized eigenvector, we need to compute the norm and then divide each component by it.

The norm squared is (1)^2 + (tan(theta/2))^2 = 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2).

So, the norm is |sec(theta/2)|. Since theta is an angle between 0 and pi, sec(theta/2) is positive.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because 1 / sec(theta/2) is cos(theta/2), and tan(theta/2) / sec(theta/2) is sin(theta/2).

Because [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by cos(theta/2) gives [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Yes, because:

cos(theta/2) * [1, tan(theta/2)] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), up to a phase factor, since in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector can be multiplied by any complex phase.

Wait a second, but the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction can also have a phase, but in this case, since n is in x-z, the phase is zero, so the eigenvector's components are real? Or perhaps I made a mistake because the operator P includes P_y, which is imaginary.

Wait no, in our case, the operator P along n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, because n is in the x-z plane (n_y=0). So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but when I found the eigenvector, I got (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the first part. But option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates, but not necessarily normalized.

Wait, the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So, which option matches this?

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I just derived. But wait, are there any phase factors or normalization factors I might have missed?

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator is given in terms of each component P_x, P_y, P_z. But the overall operator along n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So, when solving for the eigenvector, we've already considered that n_y is zero. So the eigenvector's components are real and depend on theta/2.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

That's exactly what I've got. So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the options have hbar in some of them. Oh wait, the question says that the components are elements of the normalized eigenvector. Wait, no, no; wait, the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, and its elements can be complex numbers, but in this case, it's real because the operator along the x-z direction is real? Or maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the matrix P along n is real? Because n is in x-z, so n_x and n_z are real, and the matrix elements are real. So the eigenvalues would be real, and the eigenvectors would have real components if the operator is Hermitian, which it is, since P is a component of angular momentum, which is Hermitian.

So, the eigenvector should have real components. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), real components.

But looking at the options again:

Option D says something with sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but that seems to include hbar, which would not be part of the eigenvector's elements because eigenvectors are unit vectors, and have no units. So options A, D have hbar in them, which probably shouldn't be there. So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but looking back at the eigenvalue equation, I had:

The operator P along n is (ħ/2) times a matrix. The eigenvalue is ħ/2, so the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> =0.

But when I derived the eigenvector, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is a unit vector, because cos² + sin² =1.

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

Wait, but let's check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's it.

But wait, what about the possibility of a phase factor? The eigenvector is only defined up to a phase, but since the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me recap.

The operator along n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) times a matrix, as given.

So, the matrix for P along n is:

ħ/2 * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = I |v>.

Wait, no: (P - (ħ/2) I)|v> =0.

So, P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which gives:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = I |v>

Wait, that can't be right because P has (ħ/2) as a factor. Wait wait: Let me redo this step.

The matrix for P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the equation P |v> = (ħ/2) |v> is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by ħ/2 (assuming it's non-zero), we get:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = I |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ] |v> =0.

Which brings us back to the same earlier step.

So, the conclusion is that the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So, the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each of which is a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $P$ along $\vec{n}$ is:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Substituting $P$, this becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}
|v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we get:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z - 1 & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z - 1
\end{bmatrix}
|v\rangle = 0.
\]

To solve this, we focus on the first row of the matrix equation:

\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} v_1.
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = v_1 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\| |v\rangle \| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + \left(v_1 \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}\right)^2}.
\]

Factoring out $v_1^2$, we get:

\[
\| |v\rangle \| = |v_1| \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}\right)^2}.
\]

Using the identity $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, we simplify:

\[
\| |v\rangle \| = |v_1| \sqrt{\frac{n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2}{n_x^2}}.
\]

Expanding $(1 - n_z)^2$ and simplifying further, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
|v\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. This matches the form given in option C.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization factors, which are not consistent with the problem.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
