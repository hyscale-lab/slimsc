Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So the question is asking which of the given moieties show optical isomerism.

Looking at the options given:
1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the choices are A, B, C, D, each selecting a combination of these.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with number 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the two phenyl rings rotating with respect to each other. So in biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that allow for different configurations, like if there are two different groups on each ring, you can get cis and trans isomers. Wait, but for optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, the molecule needs to have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, the structure here is a biphenyl with two nitro groups on each ring at positions 6,6' and two carboxylate ester groups at 2,2'. So each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl group. Does this create a chiral center? No, because the biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center. But maybe the arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl can lead to enantiomers if the molecule is not planar and has a plane of symmetry. Wait, but biphenyls can have diastereomers if the substituents are in positions that cause the molecule to have E and Z forms. But for optical activity, the molecule needs to have chirality, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has a non-superimposable mirror image.

Wait, let me think. The molecule has two nitro groups and two ester groups. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it would show optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself isn't chiral, but perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged so that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look at the next options and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure of this is CH3-O-CO-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester would be methyl ester: OMe group attached to the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-? Wait, no, wait, the formula is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CHOH-CH3? Wait, wait. Let me think. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with the ester group. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-; when esterified with methyl, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, the molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; so the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Hmm, but wait, that would make the molecule have a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but in that structure, is there a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon (second carbon) has OH, CH3 (from the first carbon, CH2), another CH2COOCH3 group. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxy, then the OH is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Wait, wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, but wait, the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to two CH2 groups, a OH, and the rest. Let me count the substituents: the second carbon in the chain (assuming the COOCH3 is the first carbon) is the second carbon. So the substituents would be:

- One CH2-OH (actually, wait, it's CH2 connected to the OH and another CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure as:

The acid is propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy group would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methyl, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and maybe two other CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

The molecule is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try again. The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no. Because propanoate is three carbons in a row: COOCH3 is the last carbon, then the middle is CH(OH), and the first is CH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Ah, okay, so the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So the second carbon (the CH(OH)) has four substituents: two CH3 groups? Wait, wait, no. Let's break it down.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

The propanoate part is CH2CH2COO-, but the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3.

In any case, the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. The central carbon (the one with OH) would have four different substituents if that's the case. So, for a chiral center, the carbon must have four distinct groups attached.

Looking at the structure: 

Carbon 1: COOCH3 group
Carbon 2: OH, and two CH3 groups? Or is it CH2 groups?

Wait, let's think again. The formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain: CH3-CHOH-COOH.

So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.

So the carbon with the OH is the middle carbon (second carbon). Let's see the substituents:

- One CH3 (from the first carbon)
- One COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- One OH
- And the fourth substituent is a hydrogen? Or another group?

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from left)
2. COOCH3 (from right)
3. OH
4. And a hydrogen? Because it's CH, not CH2.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is CH(OH), meaning it has two CH3 groups? No, wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)- 
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because Carbon 2 is CH(OH), it's connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- And a hydrogen.

So the substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Are these four substituents different? Let's see: CH3, COOCH3 (which is an ester group), OH, and H. So yes, four different groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 would show optical isomerism.

Moving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. Its structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The central carbon is double-bonded to O. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Now, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center. But in benzophenone, the central carbon is double-bonded to O and has two phenyl groups attached. So the structure is:

Ph
|
C=O
|
Ph

Wait, no, the structure is (Ph)2C=O. So the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and another substituent? Wait, no. Benzophenone is a ketone with two phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, that's correct. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. So the groups attached to the central carbon are:

- Two phenyl groups (same)
- One O (double bond, so it's a carbonyl)
- One single bond to another group? Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon has double bond to O, and single bonds to two phenyl groups. So the valence is double bond (two bonds) and two single bonds. So the groups are: two phenyl, one O (double bond), and nothing else. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and a double bond to O. So the substituents are two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and that's it. Wait, but that can't be because each carbon has four bonds. Oh, wait, no— the central carbon is in a ketone group. So it's R-C(=O)-R. So the central carbon is connected to two R groups (phenyl), a carbonyl O, and another R group? Wait, no, no. Wait, no, in benzophenone, the structure is (Ph)₂CO. So the central carbon has a double bond to O, and two single bonds to phenyl groups. So the substituents are two phenyl groups and a double bond to O. But where is the fourth bond?

Wait, no, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and perhaps another group? No, that can't be because the structure is (Ph)₂CO. So the carbonyl is a double bond to O, and two phenyl groups attached. So the central carbon has three substituents: two phenyl and a double bond to O. But that's only three bonds. Wait, no, because the double bond counts as two bonds. So, the central carbon has two single bonds (to each phenyl) and one double bond to O. That's three bonds, but a carbon needs four. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, benzophenone is (Ar)₂CO, where Ar is aryl. So the structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar. So the central carbon is bonded to two aryl groups and a carbonyl group (O double bond). So the valence: each Ar is a single bond, O is a double bond. So the central carbon has three substituents. But that's impossible because each carbon must have four bonds. Oh wait, maybe the structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar, which is (Ar)₂CO. So the central carbon has two Ar groups, a carbonyl O (double bond), and another substituent? No, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the correct structure is Ar–CO–Ar, meaning the central carbon is connected to two Ar groups, one O (double bond), and another H? No, because that would be acetophenone if there's an H. No, benzophenone doesn't have an H on the carbonyl carbon. So perhaps the structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar, where the central carbon has two Ar groups, a carbonyl O, and no other substituents. That can't be because then the central carbon would have only three bonds. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me think again. Benzophenone has the structure where two benzene rings are attached to a carbonyl group. So the structure is:

Ph–(C=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups. So the substituents on the central carbon are: two phenyl groups and the double bond to O. But wait, that's only three bonds. How? Because each double bond is two bonds. So, the central carbon has two single bonds (to two phenyl groups) and one double bond (to O). So that's three bonds total, but that leaves one more bond. Maybe I'm not considering it correctly.

Wait, the central carbon is connected via a double bond to O (so that's two bonds), and two single bonds to phenyl groups. So that's four bonds in total: two single (to phenyl) and one double (to O), but wait, that's three bonds. So I'm missing one. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CO–Ph, where the CO is a carbonyl group. So the central carbon is part of the carbonyl, which is a double bond to O, and attached to two phenyl groups. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and another substituent—wait, no. There's no other substituent. So maybe this is an error in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps benzophenone's structure is such that the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl O, but that leaves an unaccounted bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me move on.

Regardless, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the central carbon is either double-bonded to O and has two identical phenyl groups, making it a trigonal planar geometry, not a tetrahedral. So no chiral centers. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. The ester would replace the -OH groups with OCH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, the structure would have two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, wait. The structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is:

HO2C–CH2–CH2–CO2H, but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H, with the double bond between the two middle carbons, and the two COOH groups on either side.

So dimethyl fumarate would be CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, more accurately, it's (Z) and (E) isomerism. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
|
COOCH3

No, that's not right. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3
|
(But that's not correct. Let me think again.)

Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is:

HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond, making it HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, which is the trans (E) isomer.

So dimethyl fumarate is the diester, so both -OH groups are replaced with OCH3. So the structure is OCH3–COO–CH=CH–COO–OCH3, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, more accurately, it's CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3) but in the trans configuration.

Now, for stereoisomerism, can this molecule have optical isomers? Well, let's see if it has a chiral center. Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, in the double bond, each carbon is connected to two substituents on either side.

Wait, no. Each of the two central carbons in the double bond (CH) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 or CH? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think about the structure again.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups. Alternatively, each is connected to one COOCH3, one CH₂ group, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but has geometric isomerism (cis and trans). But geometric isomerism is not optical isomerism. So if a molecule has geometric isomerism, it doesn't necessarily exhibit optical activity unless it has chirality.

Wait, so for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Dimethyl fumarate, being the trans isomer, doesn't have a chiral center because the substituents on each side are the same. Wait, no, each side is a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group?

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and another substituent. Let me imagine the structure:

Imagine the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is connected to COOCH3 and a CH2 group (from the other side), and C2 is connected to another COOCH3 and a CH3 group?

Wait, perhaps it's better to see each carbon in the double bond as being connected to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups. But in the trans configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents. For example, each carbon has a COOCH3 and another substituent that's the same on both sides.

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe each has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more precisely written as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
|
O-C-OCH3
O

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and another group.

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons has the same substituents. So for example, each has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But then, if substituents on each carbon are the same on both sides, perhaps there's no chiral center.

Wait, maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, if the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, the molecule could be achiral. For example, if each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and another group that's the same on both sides, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral.

Wait, but fumarate is the trans isomer. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Let me think about the substituents on each carbon.

Carbon 1: attached to COOCH3 and CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents. If each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but the arrangement is such that each carbon's substituents are different from the other, then perhaps each carbon is a chiral center. For example, if Carbon 1 has COOCH3, CH2CH3, and two other groups, but wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon has a COOCH3, a CH2, and two H's. But that would make them not chiral because they have two H's, which are same.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Fumarate (the acid) is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans. When esterified with methyl groups, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), trans.

So each of the two central carbons (the CH in the double bond) is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, in the ester, each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So for each, the substituents are COOCH3, CH2, and two H's?

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group
- And two H's.

So each of these would have groups: COOCH3, CH2, H, H.

But that would mean each has two H's, making them not chiral. So each carbon would not be a chiral center. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond has two different substituents, making them chiral centers. For example, perhaps each has a COOCH3, a CH2, and two different groups. Wait, but that's not the case here because each has the same substituents on each carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, in the trans configuration, the molecule may be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, then it would not be chiral. So if dimethyl fumarate is symmetric, then it doesn't have optical isomerism. So if it's the trans isomer, perhaps the molecule is planar and symmetrical, hence not chiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, wait— no, I'm probably wrong. Because, for example, maleic acid's ester (dimethyl maleate) has both substituents on the same side, making it a diastereomer of fumarate. But in terms of chirality, does the molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps I'm better off looking for the presence of a chiral center. Each of the two double-bond carbons in dimethyl fumarate: what groups are attached?

Each has:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group (if I'm correct)
- And two H's.

So each has two H's, which are same. So no, each carbon doesn't have four distinct groups. Therefore, no chiral centers. Hence, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, wait a second— that can't be right because I've read that dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomers. Or do I confuse it with another compound?

Wait, let me think again. If the substituents on each double-bond carbon are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So if each carbon has the same groups, the molecule is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two substituents on each carbon are different. Let me imagine the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. So each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But wait, perhaps each carbon also has two H's. So the substituents are COOCH3, CH2, H, H. So no chiral centers. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I've heard that fumaric acid has cis and trans isomers, and that the trans isomer is called fumarate. But that refers to geometric isomerism, not optical. So dimethyl fumarate itself, which is the diester of the trans isomer, doesn't have any chiral centers. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe the ester groups in dimethyl fumarate create a chiral center elsewhere. But no, the ester groups are on the same carbons as the double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, in the trans configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. For instance, if you have two identical groups on either end of the double bond, the molecule would be symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is achiral.

So, going back, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So which of the options have optical isomerism?

Options:

1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

I need to analyze this. Biphenyl compounds can have different isomerisms. The biphenyl ring can have substituents in such a way that the molecule is chiral. Let's imagine the structure: two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has nitro groups at position 6 and 6' (so para to the connecting bond), and carboxylate ester groups at positions 2 and 2' (ortho to the connecting bond).

So the structure would be:

Ph–Ph

Each phenyl has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, but each ring has two substituents: at 2 and 6 positions. So one ring would have nitro at 6 and ester at 2; the other ring would have nitro at 6' and ester at 2'.

Now, the question is whether this molecule is chiral.

For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at para (relative to the connecting bond) and an ester at ortho. So looking at each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Now, the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring— would this create a chiral center?

Wait, but biphenyl itself isn't a chiral center. However, the molecule could have a chiral arrangement of substituents, leading to enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Let's imagine the molecule: if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl group. Are these groups arranged symmetrically?

Wait, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So in each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. If you imagine looking along the bond connecting the two rings, the substituents on each ring are in positions that could mirror each other. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions are not mirrored, then the molecule would be chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the connecting bond, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, so it's not chiral. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: if the two nitro groups are on the same face of the biphenyl, perhaps the molecule would have a chiral arrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. The biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring— perhaps it has a center of inversion, making it achiral.

Wait, the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring: the substituents are on opposite sides of each ring. So looking at one ring, the nitro is at 6, and the ester is at 2. If the substituents on the other ring are arranged in the same way, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps not.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule is not chiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another thought: the molecule has two identical substituents on each ring, but arranged in a way that they are mirror images. So perhaps the molecule is achiral because any asymmetry is balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis or plane, making it chiral.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of an example. For instance, 1,1'-biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents on each ring are the same (like both nitro groups), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But in this case, each ring has a nitro and an ester. So the substituents are different on each ring.

Wait, each ring has a nitro and an ester group. So the substituents on each ring are different, which could lead to the molecule being chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

In any case, I'm not fully confident about this one. Let me proceed with what I know.

So, to recap:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

I'm unsure if this has optical isomerism. Let me check my notes. Oh wait, perhaps biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality, which is a type of chirality related to the torsion angle between the two rings. But axial chirality typically applies to compounds like biphenyls with certain substituents that can make the molecule chiral. So if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, it's chiral.

In this case, each ring has nitro and ester groups. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not certain. Let's assume for a moment that option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism. Then which options would that affect?

The question is, which of the moieties show optical isomerism. So we have options 1, 2, 3, 4.

From earlier analysis:

Option 2: yes, has chiral center.

Option 3: no.

Option 4: no.

Option 1: uncertain, but perhaps yes.

Wait, but wait— another approach. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it should have a chiral center or another form of chirality, like in allenes or certain ring structures.

If option 1's molecule has a chiral center, then it would show optical isomerism. But maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but has axial chirality. For instance, biphenyls with substituents that make the molecule chiral around the central bond.

In biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on the rings are arranged in a way that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it can exhibit axial chirality. So the molecule would have optical isomerism.

So, in option 1, each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl ester group. The arrangement could lead to the molecule being chiral. So perhaps option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if option 1 and 2 are correct, then the correct choices would be 1 and 2, which is option D: 1 and 2.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. But the options given are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So if options 1 and 2 both have optical isomerism, then D is the correct answer. But earlier, I was uncertain about option 1.

Wait, let me think again. If the molecule in option 1 has a chiral center, then yes. But in the structure, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester. Are any of the carbons in the rings chiral centers? Not the phenyl carbons, because they're sp² hybridized. So any chiral centers must be elsewhere.

Wait, the molecule is a biphenyl with substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups and ester groups. The ester groups are OMe attached to the carbonyl. So the carbons attached to the ester groups are part of the aromatic rings, so they're sp² hybridized and thus not chiral centers.

So the only possibility for chirality is in the arrangement of the substituents around the biphenyl structure, which could lead to axial chirality. So if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (2 and 6), but on opposite ends of the biphenyl. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral.

I'm not entirely confident, but given that option 1 is listed as a possibility in option A and D, and if I'm unsure, perhaps I should make an educated guess. But based on my earlier analysis, option 2 definitely has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the first option again. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. If the biphenyl can rotate, then the arrangement could be such that the substituents are in a way that creates chirality. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because the substituents are symmetrically arranged. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, the molecule could be achiral.

But I'm not certain. Given that, perhaps the only certain case is option 2.

Wait, but I'm also considering option 4, dimethyl fumarate. Earlier, I thought it doesn't have a chiral center, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me write it as CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each of the two double-bond carbons is bonded to COOCH3 and CH2. Do these substituents make the carbon a chiral center?

Each double-bond carbon would have:

- COOCH3
- CH2-
- And two H's.

So each has three substituents: COOCH3, CH2, and two H's. Therefore, each carbon would have two H's, so they're not chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the options that exhibit optical isomerism are 2 and perhaps 1.

But I'm unsure about option 1. However, based on the earlier analysis, option 2 definitely has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, looking back at the problem, the question is about which of the moieties show optical isomerism. Let me recount:

1. Could exhibit it? Maybe.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So the correct options would be 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: 1 and 2.

So, the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which is essential for optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at the 6 positions and ester groups at the 2 positions on each ring. Biphenyl compounds can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the rings are arranged asymmetrically. In this case, the nitro and ester groups on each ring are in specific positions (2 and 6), which could result in a lack of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, it would exhibit optical isomerism. However, the exact symmetry of the molecule is unclear, so this option is uncertain.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four distinct groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. Since it has a chiral center, this molecule definitely exhibits optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has two identical phenyl groups, making it planar and symmetrical. There are no chiral centers, so benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)=CH(COOCH₃). The two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a COOCH₃ group and a CH₂ group. Since no carbon has four distinct substituents, there are no chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical in the trans configuration, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, only **Option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** definitely exhibits optical isomerism. Option 1 is uncertain due to the potential for symmetry in the biphenyl structure, but it is included in the answer as it is listed in the options. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
