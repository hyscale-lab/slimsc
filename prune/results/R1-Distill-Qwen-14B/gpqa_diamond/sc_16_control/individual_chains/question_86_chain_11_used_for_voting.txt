Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but the starting materials are compounds A and B, which are treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively.

Wait, wait. Let me read again. Oh right, so for reaction A, the reagent is LiBH4, and the product is (R)-4-ethyl... something. Reaction B uses BH3 and gives (S)-4-ethyl... same product.

The options give different structures for A and B. All the options involve 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations (S or R) for A and B.

Hmm. So, what's happening here? I think this is a reduction reaction, probably of a ketone to an alcohol. But wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyranone. Oh, maybe it's a cyclic ketone being reduced.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the product structure. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H suggests that the ring is partially unsaturated? Or not. Wait, tetrahydro means four hydrogen, so the ring is fully saturated. So, it's a cyclic ether, specifically a tetrahydropyran, which is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Oh, and the 2-one means a ketone at position 2.

So, the structure would be a six-membered ring, oxygen at position 1, and a ketone at position 2. And there's an ethyl group at position 4.

The product is either R or S configuration. The starting material A and B are treated with different reagents, giving different stereoisomers.

Wait, so the starting material must be a ketone or another group that upon reduction forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a reduction of a cyclic ester or something else. Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. The options are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me draw that structure.

So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but substituted. The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me count the carbons.

Pentanoic acid is: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentanoic is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the substituents: 3-ethyl, so on the third carbon (counting from the COOH as carbon 1?), or numbering from the other end?

Wait, the IUPAC nomenclature for pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is five carbons: COOH is C1, next is C2, etc. So, substituents at C3 would be the third from COOH.

So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C*(CH2CH2CH3)(O-isobutyl)-CH2-CH2?

Wait, wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Let me number from the COOH end as C1. So:

C1: COOH
C2: CH2
C3: CH (with substituents)
C4: CH2
C5: CH3? Because it's pentanoic acid. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents.

- 3-ethyl: so on C3 (counting from the COOH end), there's an ethyl group attached.
- 5-isobutoxy: on C5, an isobutoxy group.
- 5-oxo: a ketone at C5.

Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid is five carbons. So numbering from COOH as 1, the positions are 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH with ethyl), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2?) but wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so positions 1: COOH, 2: CH2, 3: CH2, 4: CH2, 5: CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me structure the molecule.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the parent chain is pentanoic acid: five carbons with COOH on C1.

Positions:

C1: COOH
C2: CH2
C3: CH (since 3-ethyl, so ethyl group attached here)
C4: CH2
C5: O-isobutyl and a ketone (oxo group). Wait, but C5 is the end of the chain. So, if it's 5-oxo, then the carbonyl is at C5. But wait, that would be a ketone on the last carbon, but that's not possible because the last carbon is a methyl (if it's pentanoic acid). Hmm, maybe I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(OIsobu)-O

Wait, but with an oxo group? Or perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone (tetrahydropyran-2-one). So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) which upon reduction forms the cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone that is opened and reformed. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, when treated with a reducing agent, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents but generally for carbonyl groups. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes to form alcohols. BH3 is often used in combination with other reagents, like in hydroboration, but here it's used with H+, perhaps in a different context.

Wait, but considering that the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar.

Wait, another approach. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with O at position 1, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, positions 1 (O), 2 (keto), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2CH2CH3?), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH2), closing the ring.

Wait, but how does that form from the starting material?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone that, upon reduction, becomes an alcohol which then undergoes some cyclization.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, if the starting material A is a ketone (like 5-oxopentanoate?), then treatment with LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. Similarly for BH3, but perhaps under different conditions.

Wait, but both reactions are giving similar products, just R and S configurations. So, the stereochemistry must arise from the reduction step.

Wait, think about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. The configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's conditions.

Wait, but wait. When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the product's configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride. In the case of a cyclic ketone, perhaps the reducing agent approach from a specific face, determining the stereochemistry.

Wait, but here the starting material isn't a cyclic ketone. It's a pentanoic acid derivative. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let's think: gamma-keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, they can be reduced to give diols, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxide. But that doesn't seem to fit the description.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone, which upon reduction forms an alcohol, which then undergoes ring-opening or rearrangement to form the product. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters? No, I think esters are more resistant. Wait, no, LiBH4 usually can't reduce esters. But it can reduce ketones.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, it's a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group on C3, an isobutoxy group on C5, and a ketone on C5.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(H)(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, but wait, that would place the oxo group on the same carbon as the isobutoxy group. So, that carbon is both O-iBu and a carbonyl. Hmm, that's possible but maybe not very stable. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Let's say, the structure is:

R-O-C-O-CO-R'

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. But let me think about the product again.

The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl at position 4.

So, how is this formed? Maybe from a glycol or a diol that cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol (from a reduction) that then undergoes cyclization to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

Wait, if the starting material is a ketone, and upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, it forms a secondary alcohol. Then, maybe the alcohol can undergo some kind of elimination or cyclization to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reductant is opening it in a certain way.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward. The starting material is a ketone. When reduced, it becomes an alcohol. The configuration of the alcohol (R or S) depends on the reagent and the starting material.

Wait, but in the product, the alcohol is part of a ring. So, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone which upon reduction gives a diol, but that doesn't fit the product structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that has a ketone group. Then, upon reduction, the ketone is converted to an alcohol, which could lead to ring opening or perhaps ring formation.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reagents and their typical reactions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce ketones, aldehydes, esters (under certain conditions?), amides (not usually), and maybe other carbonyl groups.

BH3 is usually used in hydroboration reactions, where it adds to alkenes in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov orientation and is stereospecific, giving alcohols with certain configurations. But here, BH3 is used with H+.

Wait, perhaps it's a BH3-based reduction of a ketone. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Normally, BH3 is used in the presence of a Lewis acid like THF to form a more active borane, which then reduces carbonyl groups. The reaction of BH3 with ketones typically gives secondary alcohols, but the stereochemistry depends on the approach of the borane.

Wait, so when a ketone is reduced by LiBH4 versus BH3, does the stereochemistry of the product differ? In the case of a prochiral ketone, one reagent might lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a hydride source and typically leads to syn addition. Wait, no, LiBH4 is a hydride donor and typically does not proceed through a mechanism that leads to stereoselectivity in the product because the hydride attacks the planar carbonyl, leading to a racemic mixture unless the starting ketone is chiral.

Wait, but if the starting material is a chiral ketone, then the reduction could lead to retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the reagent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material A and B are enantiomers. So, when reduced with different reagents, the configuration at the chiral center would change in a certain way.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the starting material is a chiral ketone. Then, when you reduce it with a reagent that can approach from a particular face, you get either R or S configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a hydride donor. The hydride would attack the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. So, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material's configuration and the direction from which the hydride approaches.

Wait, perhaps when the starting material is (R) configuration, LiBH4 would add the hydride from one face, leading to a certain product configuration, while BH3 would add from the opposite face.

Alternatively, maybe the reducing agents have different steric effects or approaches, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but in the problem, the product from reagent A is (R), and from B is (S). So, the same starting material, if reduced with different agents, could give opposite configurations.

But in this question, the starting materials A and B are different; they're treated with different reagents, giving different configurations.

Wait, the options are that A and B are either the same or different. Looking at the options:

Option A: Both A and B are S configuration.

Option B: Both are R.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, the correct answer is likely that A and B are enantiomers, because treating them with different reagents leads to different products.

So, why would different reagents lead to different configurations when starting from enantiomeric starting materials.

Wait, perhaps because the reagents approach the carbonyl from different faces, leading to opposite configurations when the starting material is enantiomeric.

Wait, let me consider a specific example. Suppose the starting material is a chiral ketone with configuration R. When reduced with a reagent like LiBH4, which is a hydride donor, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. If the ketone has a certain configuration, the addition could lead to a specific stereochemistry in the alcohol.

Wait, but if the starting materials are enantiomers, their ketone groups are mirror images. So, when reduced, would they produce alcohols that are also enantiomers?

Wait, perhaps. Let's say the starting material A is (R) configuration, and starting material B is (S) configuration. When each is reduced, perhaps the product configuration depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but how does the hydride approach affect the configuration?

Wait, in a ketone, say (R) configuration, the carbonyl is at a certain position. The hydride can approach from either the Re or Si face. For LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the hydride would add to the less hindered face, but that depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydride attacks from the opposite face, leading to inversion of configuration.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose the ketone is (R)-configuration. When reduced, does it form (S)-alcohol, or retain the configuration?

Wait, no, because the ketone is planar, the addition of the hydride can come from either side, so the product will be a racemic mixture unless the starting material is chiral and the approach is stereoselective.

Wait, but if the starting material is chiral, the existing configuration could influence the direction from which the hydride approaches.

Wait, maybe the chiral center in the starting material affects the approach of the reducing agent, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a chiral center, and the reduction leads to a specific stereochemistry based on the reagent.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Identify the product structure: it's a cyclic ketone with specific substituents.

2. Understand the starting materials: they are pentanoic acid derivatives with a ketone and an isobutoxy group.

3. The reactions involve different reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) leading to R and S configurations.

4. The question is to select which starting materials (A and B) would give rise to these products.

So, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a ketone group in the starting material to form a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because you're reducing a ketone to an alcohol, which is not a ketone anymore.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes into the ring.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, upon reduction, forms a diol. The diol could then undergo cyclization, perhaps via an acid-catalyzed process, to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reducing agents are causing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: when a cyclic ketone is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol. But if the ring is six-membered, the resulting diol might not form a ring. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. When reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, leading to a diol which can cyclize to form the pyran ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an orthoester or another structure that upon reduction forms the desired ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes an intramolecular hemiacetal formation to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the starting material has a gamma-keto ester group. Let's say the structure is:

COO-R-CH2-CH2-CO-R'

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a gamma-keto ester would have the structure:

RCOCH2CH2COOR'

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, perhaps it's more like:

CH2CH2COOH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O-iBu

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, but that's five carbons in the chain. Numbering from COOH as 1, so C3 is ethyl, and C5 is both isobutoxy and oxo.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative where the C5 is both an isobutoxy (ether group) and a ketone. That would make the structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, but that would have the ketone and the ether on the same carbon, which might not be very stable. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C*(CH2CH2CH3)(O-iBu)-CH2-CH3

But that would be 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy pentanoic acid, but with a 5-oxo group as well.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Maybe the structure is a 5-oxo-pentanoic acid derivative with substituents on C3 and C5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH3)(O-iBu)-CH2-CH3?

No, because that would be 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy pentanoic acid, but with a 5-oxo group. Wait, but pentanoic acid is five carbons, so maybe it's:

COOH-(CH2)2-C(O-iBu)=O-CH2CH2CH3? I'm getting confused here.

Maybe I should think about the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has an ethyl group at position 4.

So, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester (or a similar structure) that upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

In such a case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product. So, the starting material's configuration (R or S) would lead to the product's configuration upon reduction.

Now, the question is, which starting materials (A and B) would lead to (R) and (S) configurations upon reduction with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. How do they affect the stereochemistry of the product?

Wait, LiBH4 is a hydride donor, and in the reduction of a ketone, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration.

BH3, on the other hand, is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are stereospecific. But in this case, maybe it's used as a reducing agent. Hmm, wait, normally, BH3 isn't a strong enough reducing agent for ketones, but when used with a Lewis acid like THF, it can form a more active borane that can reduce ketones.

Wait, but in this problem, BH3 is used with H+. Hmm, perhaps it's in an acidic environment, which could influence the approach of the hydride or boron.

Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is used in a different way, like in a conjugate addition or something.

But let me think about the stereochemistry.

If the starting material is a chiral ketone, then the reduction with LiBH4 could lead to a specific configuration in the alcohol, depending on the approach of the hydride. Similarly, BH3 could approach from a different face, leading to the opposite configuration.

Wait, but if the starting materials are enantiomers, then the approach direction of the reducing agents would lead to opposite configurations in the products.

So, for example, if starting material A is (R), and reagent is LiBH4, it gives (R)-product. Starting material B is (S), and reagent is BH3, which gives (S)-product.

Wait, but in the problem, the products are R and S respectively for A and B.

So, perhaps A is (R) and B is (S), which would lead to the products being R and S.

Wait, but the options are:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, this would make the products R and S when using reagents LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Wait, but why would the same starting material (if A and B were same) give opposite products? It wouldn't, unless something else is influencing the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents lead to different configurations based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is (R), and reagent A is LiBH4, which adds the hydride from a certain face, it could lead to an (R) product. If the starting material is (S), and reagent B is BH3, which adds from the opposite face, leading to an (S) product.

But in that case, the starting materials A and B would have to be enantiomers.

Looking back at the options, option D says:

A = (R), B = (S).

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, perhaps the product is R; if B is S and treated with BH3, the product is S.

But why would the same starting material with different reagents give different configurations? Maybe because the approach of the hydride is influenced by the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, perhaps when the starting material is R, and the hydride approaches from the Re face, the product is R. For the same starting material but a different reagent, maybe the hydride approaches from the Si face, leading to S. But that's not the case here, as the starting materials are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and each reagent leads to the opposite configuration.

Wait, but if A is R and reagent is LiBH4, it gives R-product. If B is S and reagent is BH3, it gives S-product. Which would be the case only if the reagents cause the same configuration as the starting material.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think about a specific example.

Suppose the starting material is a chiral ketone with configuration R. When reduced with a hydride agent, the hydride attacks from the less hindered face. The less hindered face would be the one opposite to the largest substituent. So, if the starting material has a large group on one side, the hydride will attack from the opposite side, leading to a specific configuration in the alcohol.

If the starting material is the enantiomer (S configuration), the less hindered face would be on the opposite side, leading the hydride to attack from the same face as before, but due to the mirror image, the product would have the opposite configuration.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if the starting material is R, and the reagent adds the hydride to a specific face, the product could be R. If the starting material is S, and the reagent adds the same face, the product would be S. So, same configuration as the starting material.

But in the problem, the products are R and S, so if the starting materials are R and S, then the reagents would produce R and S products, respectively.

Wait, but that would require that the reagents don't change the configuration. So, if the starting material is R, the product is R. If the starting material is S, the product is S.

So, the starting material A would be R, reagent LiBH4 gives R-product. Starting material B is S, reagent BH3 gives S-product.

So, the correct option would be D: A is R, B is S.

Which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives, differing in their stereochemistry (R or S configuration).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone (tetrahydropyran-2-one) with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Reagents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the approach of the hydride ion, which depends on the steric and electronic environment of the starting material.
   - **BH3**: Typically used in hydroboration reactions, but in this context, it likely reduces the ketone group similarly to LiBH4, with stereochemical outcomes influenced by the starting material's configuration.

3. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are enantiomers: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
   - When reduced, the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.

4. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - If the starting material is (R)-configured, the reduction with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product.
   - If the starting material is (S)-configured, the reduction with BH3 produces the (S)-product.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - For the product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
   - For the product (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Thus, the correct starting materials are:
- **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**
- **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
