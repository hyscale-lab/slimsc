Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, when I think about stars, mass and radius aren't always directly proportional, but for this problem, it's given, so I'll take that as a given.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that's the wavelength where their spectral radiance is maximum, which is given by Wien's law. So yes, same λ_max implies same temperature.

So, T1 = T2.

Then, the problem mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, since they are using the same method to determine their brightness (spectroscopy), would the Doppler shift affect the observed maximum wavelength? Because if one star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would shift, which could affect how we perceive their brightness.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, perhaps they observed the same λ_max after accounting for any Doppler shifts. Or maybe the given λ_max is the observed one, not the intrinsic. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found them to be the same. So, perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. But if the stars are moving, their intrinsic temperatures would be different. Because the observed wavelength is the intrinsic λ_max adjusted by the Doppler shift.

So, let me think. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the source's wavelength λ_source by the Doppler shift formula. For radial velocity v, if the source is moving away, λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c), and if moving towards, it's (1 - v/c), but velocities are usually small compared to c, so we can approximate.

Wait, but in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift for it. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Let's think about the direction. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that could be moving away or towards us. But the problem says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the intrinsic λ_max is the same, so T is the same. But that would ignore the Doppler effect. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming black body radiation. So, perhaps the temperature used in the black body calculation is the intrinsic temperature, not the observed. Let me think again.

If the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would shift, but the problem says their observed λ_max is the same. So, their observed λ_max is same, which would mean that the intrinsic λ_max (i.e., their temperature) is different, but adjusted by the Doppler shift to have the same observed λ_max.

So, for Star_1: v1 = 0 km/s. So observed λ1_max = intrinsic λ1_max.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (but the Doppler shift formula can handle direction with signs). So, λ2_obs_max = λ2_intrinsic_max * (1 + v2/c), because moving away would redshift the wavelength.

Wait, but for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_intrinsic.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c), since it's moving away (assuming v is positive when moving away). But according to the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs, since they are the same.

So,

λ1_intrinsic = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c )

But λ is proportional to 1/T, so λ1 / λ2 = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but this would make T2 higher than T1. Because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, since v2 is positive.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying that the intrinsic wavelength must be shorter, so higher temperature. So, yes, T2 would be higher than T1.

But the problem says that the stars' luminosities are computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So, their intrinsic temperatures are T1 and T2, with T2 higher than T1.

But the problem says that in their calculations, they found that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. So, I need to compute L1/L2.

The formula for luminosity of a black body is L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 and T2 are related through the Doppler effect.

From earlier, we have:

λ1_intrinsic = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v2/c )

But λ1 = (hc/(k_B T1)) * some constant, but perhaps it's easier to use λ proportional to 1/T.

Alternatively, since λ1 = λ2_observed / (1 + v2/c ) if it's moving away.

Wait, maybe I should write the Doppler shift correctly.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) , but for small velocities, this approximates to λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c )

Wait, no, actually, the exact formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c ) , where v is positive when moving away.

So, for Star_1: v1=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_source.

For Star_2: v2=700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, λ2_obs = λ2_source * (1 + v2/c )

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_source = λ2_source * (1 + v2/c )

But λ is proportional to 1/T, so λ1 / λ2 = T2 / T1.

Thus,

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

I can compute v2 in terms of c. Let me compute v2/c.

v2 = 700 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

So, 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.002333...

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, but that's a very small difference. So, T2 is slightly larger than T1.

Now, going back to the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2/R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4.

Compute that.

Let me compute 1.002333 to the 4th power.

Approximating (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx for small x. Since x is 0.002333, which is about 0.002333, so n=4.

So, (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.002333 = 1 + 0.009333 ≈ 1.009333.

But more accurately, perhaps I can calculate it.

Compute (1.002333)^4.

Let's compute step by step.

First, 1.002333^2: 1.002333 * 1.002333.

= 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.004666 + approx 0.00000544.

≈ 1.00467144.

Then, (1.00467144)^2 = (1.00467144)^2.

Again, compute 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + approx 0.0000218.

≈ 1.00936468.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00936468.

So, T2^4 ≈ T1^4 * 1.00936468.

Thus, T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00936468 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, wait wait. Wait, let me think again. Because T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

So, T1^4 = (T2^4) / (1.002333)^4.

Which is T2^4 / 1.00936468.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / 1.00936468 ≈ approximately 0.9907.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 1/(1.00936468).

Since 1.00936468 = 1 + 0.00936468.

1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

So, 1/(1.00936468) ≈ 1 - 0.00936468 = 0.99063532.

So, approximately 0.9906.

So, now, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.9906) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.9906 = approx 2.25 * (1 - 0.0094) )= 2.25 - (0.02115) = approx 2.22885.

So, approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, the choices are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So, the answer would be D) ~2.23.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe I should compute the exact value without approximations. Let me recompute T2.

Wait, v2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light is 299,792 km/s, approximately 3e5 km/s.

So, v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.0023333333...

So, 1 + v2/c = 1.0023333333.

Compute (1.0023333333)^4 exactly.

Alternatively, compute (1.002333)^4 using more precise methods.

I can compute (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute (1.002333)^2:

= 1.002333 * 1.002333.

Let me compute it as (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544.

= 1.00467144.

Now, (1.00467144)^2.

= (1.00467144) * (1.00467144).

Let me compute this:

= 1 + (0.00467144 * 2) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182.

= 1.0093647.

So, (1.002333)^4 is approximately 1.0093647.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1.0093647) ≈ 0.99063.

So, L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.99063 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99063.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99063.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00063 = approx 0.0014175.

So, total is 2.2275 + 0.0014175 = approx 2.2289.

Which is approximately 2.23.

So, the factor is about 2.23 times, which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and use the relationships between luminosity, radius, temperature, and Doppler shifts.

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Relationship**:  
   \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), so \( \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).

2. **Temperature Relationship**:  
   The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), implying that their intrinsic temperatures are related through the Doppler effect.  
   For Star_2, moving away with a radial velocity \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is redshifted:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{intrinsic}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]  
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars, the intrinsic temperatures satisfy:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]  
   Substituting \( v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \):  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]  
   Thus, \( T_2 > T_1 \), with \( T_2 / T_1 \approx 1.002333 \).

3. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a black body is given by:  
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   Therefore, the luminosity ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]  
   Substituting \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_2 / T_1 = 1.002333 \):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]  
   Compute \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \) and \( (1.002333)^4 \):  
   Using the approximation \( (1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \) and \( n = 4 \):  
   \[
   (1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 1.009333
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009333} \approx 2.23
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
