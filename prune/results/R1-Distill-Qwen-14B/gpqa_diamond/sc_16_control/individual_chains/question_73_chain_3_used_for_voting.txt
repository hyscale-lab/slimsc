Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The other has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting velocities like in classical mechanics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait. Both are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, no. Actually, the relative speed would be from the perspective of astronaut 1, so astronaut 2's velocity relative to astronaut 1. So astronaut 2's speed relative to astronaut 1 is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Because v1 is higher (0.6c) than v2 (0.5c), is that right?

So plugging in the numbers: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7, which is approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but the question probably just wants the magnitude. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option in choices C and D. So that's one part down.

Now, the total energy of the system. Since these are relativistic speeds, I should use the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So each astronaut has their own energy. So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Let me calculate each:

For the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = Gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower, so I think C is correct.

Wait did I compute the energies correctly? Let me double-check.

Gamma1 for 0.6c: yes, 0.6 squared is 0.36, so 1-0.36 is 0.64, sqrt is 0.8, inverse is 1.25.

E1=1.25 * 2m c²= 2.5 m c².

Gamma2 for 0.5c: 0.5 squared is 0.25, 1-0.25 is 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is approximately 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is about 1.1547.

E2=1.1547 *3m =3.4641 m c².

Sum E is 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641, which is approximately 5.96 mc², so option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is around 5.96 mc². So option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of the second astronaut with respect to the first is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
