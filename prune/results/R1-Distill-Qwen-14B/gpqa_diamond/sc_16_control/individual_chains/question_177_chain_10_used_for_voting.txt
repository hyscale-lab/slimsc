Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think through it.

So the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And interestingly, the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But the part about the wavelengths where they appear brightest being the same makes me think of black body radiation and maybe the peak wavelength formula. Oh right, Wien's Law—lambda_max is proportional to temperature inverse. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So same lambda means same T.

Wait, but wait—what if the stars aren't perfect black bodies? Oh, the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so that's settled. So both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh right, because the surface area is 4πR² and each square meter emits σ T⁴ per second.

Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity ratio will depend on the radii squared. Because L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But T1=T2, so that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, wait a minute—the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along our line of sight. How does that affect luminosity?

Wait, no. Luminosity is an intrinsic property—how much light the star emits. Radial velocity affects the observed brightness in terms of Doppler shift, but the question says they computed the luminosities. So I think the radial velocities given (0 for Star_1, 700 km/s for Star_2) are redshift or blueshift, which would affect the observed wavelengths, but since we're told that the stars' apparent brightest wavelengths are the same, that suggests that any Doppler shift due to velocity is accounted for in their observed peak wavelengths. So perhaps the actual temperatures are adjusted based on their velocities.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity, or blueshift), its emitted wavelengths would be blueshifted—so the peak would be at a shorter wavelength. Conversely, if it's moving away (redshift), the peak would be redder. But the question says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, even though Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength is the same as Star_1's. Which has zero velocity. So, the actual temperatures must differ to compensate for the Doppler shift.

Wait, that complicates things. Because without considering the Doppler effect, their peak wavelengths would be the same as their temperatures are the same. But if one is moving, that could change the observed wavelength.

So, I think I need to adjust the effective temperature based on the Doppler shift. Let me think about that.

The Doppler effect for light is given by the formula: lambda_observed = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but I'm not exactly sure if that's the exact formula. Wait, I think for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is lambda_obs ~ lambda_source (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, redshift). But wait, wait—no, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so (1 + v/c) would multiply the source wavelength.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Let me see: because the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both is the same. But the actual lambda_max (source) would depend on their velocities. So, their intrinsic temperatures would adjust based on their velocities.

Wait, so for each star, their intrinsic (source) lambda_max is lambda_source = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c), assuming v is positive when moving away, which would cause a redshift.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it methodically.

Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed lambda_max is the same as its intrinsic lambda_max. So T1 = b / lambda_max1_observed.

Star_2 has radial velocity v=700 km/s. So we need to compute its intrinsic lambda_max2.

The Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 + v/(c)) / (1 - v/(c)) ) ) when v is positive for moving away.

But for small velocities (v << c), this can be approximated as lambda_obs ≈ lambda_source (1 + v/c).

Alternatively, another approximation for small v is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So lambda_obs = lambda_source (1 + v/c).

Wait, which approximation should I use here? Considering 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. 700 is 0.0023% of c. So small velocity, so approximation should be okay.

So, for Star_2, the observed lambda_max is lambda_obs = lambda_source * (1 + v/c). So the intrinsic lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda_source2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no: if the star is moving away (v positive), the observed lambda is longer (redshifted), so lambda_obs = lambda_source * (1 + v/c).

So, lambda_source = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c).

So, the intrinsic lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda_source2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But since both observed lambda_max are the same (lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs), then:

lambda_source1 = lambda_obs / (1 + v1/c) = lambda_obs / (1 + 0) = lambda_obs.

lambda_source2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But wait, v1 is zero, so lambda_source1 = lambda_obs.

But for Star_2, because it's moving away (v is positive), lambda_source2 would be less than lambda_obs, meaning higher temperature, because T is inversely proportional to lambda_max.

So, the temperatures of the stars are different. Because their intrinsic lambda_max are different.

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed wavelengths are same. So, their source (intrinsic) wavelengths must have Doppler shifted to the same observed lambda.

So, let me write the equations:

For Star_1 (v1=0):

lambda_obs1 = lambda_1 * (1 + v1/c) → lambda_1_obs = lambda_1 * 1 → lambda_1 = lambda_obs.

For Star_2 (v2=700 km/s):

lambda_obs2 = lambda_2 * (1 + v2/c) → lambda_obs = lambda_2 * (1 + v2/c).

So, lambda_2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

Since both have the same observed lambda_max, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs.

So, the intrinsic lambda_max for Star_2 is less than that of Star_1, because v2 is positive (moving away), so denominator is bigger than 1, making lambda_2 smaller.

But since T is inversely proportional to lambda_max, this means that Star_2 has a higher temperature than Star_1. Wait, no: if lambda_2 is smaller, then T2 = b / lambda_2 is higher.

So, T1 = b / lambda_1, T2 = b / lambda_2.

But lambda_1 = lambda_obs, lambda_2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

So, T1 = b / lambda_obs,

T2 = b / (lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) = (1 + v2/c) * (b / lambda_obs) ) = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Because v2 is positive (700 km/s away), so T2 > T1.

Wait, but wait: is the velocity given as radial velocity, but whether it's towards or away matters. The question says for Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. But in the Doppler formula, the sign of v matters. Let me clarify: if the star is moving away, v is positive, leading to redshift (longer wavelength, so lambda_obs is longer). So in that case, lambda_obs = lambda_source * (1 + v/c).

But in the question, the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, so Star_2 must have a higher intrinsic temperature to compensate for the redshift.

Now, the luminosity depends on R² T⁴. So, L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, for each star:

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4,

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4.

We need to find the ratio L1/L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / (3e5)).

Wait, let me compute 700 km/s over c.

c is 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7/(300) = 0.023333...

So, 700e3 m/s? No, wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. Oh wait, no: 1 km is 1e3 m, so 700 km/s is 700 * 1e3 m/s = 7e5 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

Now, let's plug into L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 (T1 * 1.023333)^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1.5)^2 R2² T1^4 → 2.25 R2² T1^4

Denominator: R2² (T1^4 * (1.023333)^4 )

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T1^4 (1.023333)^4 )

= 2.25 / (1.023333)^4.

Compute (1.023333)^4.

Let me compute 1.023333^4 step by step.

First, 1.023333 squared is approximately:

1.023333 * 1.023333 ≈ (approx 1.023^2). Let me compute 1.0233^2:

1.0233 * 1.0233: 1 + 2*(0.0233) + (0.0233)^2.

= 1 + 0.0466 + 0.00054289 ≈ 1.04714.

Wait, precise calculation:

1.023333^2 = approximately (1.023333)^2 = (1 + 0.023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.023333 + (0.023333)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721.

Then, square that result to get the fourth power: (1.04721)^2.

Calculating that:

1.04721 * 1.04721

= (1 + 0.04721)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04721 + (0.04721)^2.

= 1 + 0.09442 + 0.002229.

= 1.096649.

So, (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So, the denominator is 1.09665.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

2.25 divided by 1.09665.

Hmm. 1.09665 * 2 = 2.1933.

2.25 - 2.1933 = 0.0567.

So, 0.0567 / 1.09665 ≈ 0.0517.

So, 2 + 0.0517 = approximately 2.0517.

Wait, but wait—that's not right. Because 1.09665 * 2 is 2.1933. So 2.25 is 2.1933 + 0.0567. So, 2.25 / 1.09665 = 2 + 0.0567 / 1.09665 ≈ 2 + 0.0517 ≈ 2.0517.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1.09665 is about 1.09665, so 2.25 / 1.09665 is approximately 2.25 / 1.097 ≈ Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute 2.25 / 1.09665.

Let me use a calculator-like approach.

Let’s compute 1.09665 * 2.05 = ?

1.09665 * 2 = 2.1933

1.09665 * 0.05 = 0.0548325

So, 2.1933 + 0.0548325 = 2.24813.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 2.05 gives 2.24813, which is 2.25 - 2.24813 = 0.00187 less than 2.25. So, to get 2.25, perhaps 2.05 + (0.00187 / 1.09665).

Wait, 0.00187 / 1.09665 ≈ 0.0017.

So, 2.05 + 0.0017 ≈ 2.0517.

So, 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.0517.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.0517.

Wait, but none of the options are around 2.05. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, none of these are ~2.05. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the way I applied the Doppler shift. Let me go back.

Wait a second, the formula I used was for when the star is moving away, v is positive. So the Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_source * (1 + v/c). So, if lambda_obs is larger than lambda_source, which is the case when the star is moving away.

So for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_source2 * (1 + v2/c).

So, lambda_source2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But wait, the original formula for a star moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), so the rest frame lambda is shorter. So, the effective temperature is higher.

So, T2 = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

So, when calculating the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, no, wait—T2 is (1 + v2/c) * T1, so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c).

So, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2)(T1^4) / (R2^2)(T2^4) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v2/c))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1/(1.023333))^4.

Wait, so 1.023333^4 is about 1.09665 as before. So 1/(1.09665) is approximately 0.9118.

So, 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0118 = approx 0.02655.

So total is 2.025 + 0.02655 ≈ 2.05155.

Wait, that's the same as before. So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

But none of the options are around 2.05. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of T2?

Wait another thought: perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift in terms of temperature. Let me think again.

The peak wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to temperature. So, lambda_max = b / T.

If the star is moving away, the observed lambda_max is longer (redshifted), so (lambda_obs) = (b / T) * (1 + v/c).

So, T = b/(lambda_obs) * 1/(1 + v/c).

Wait, no—let me re-derive it.

The intrinsic (rest frame) lambda_max is lambda_rest = b / T.

The observed lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) when moving away.

So, lambda_obs = (b/T) * (1 + v/c).

So, T = b/(lambda_obs) * 1/(1 + v/c).

Wait, no—that's not right. Let me write it correctly.

lambda_rest = (b) / T.

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) → lambda_obs = (b / T) * (1 + v/c).

So, solving for T:

T = (b / lambda_obs) * (1 + v/c).

So, yes, T = T_obs * (1 + v/c), where T_obs is the observed temperature.

Wait, but that would mean T2 = T_obs * (1 + v2/c), and T1 = T_obs * (1 + v1/c). Since v1 is 0, T1 = T_obs.

Wait, but in this scenario, T_obs would be the same for both stars because their observed lambda_max is the same.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because each star's T is determined by their own velocity and observed lambda.

Wait, maybe the correct way is:

For each star,

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c).

So,

lambda_rest = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c).

And lambda_rest = b / T.

So,

T = b / lambda_rest = b * (1 + v/c) / lambda_obs.

Since lambda_obs is the same for both stars,

T is proportional to (1 + v/c).

So,

T1 = b * (1 + v1/c) / lambda_obs.

T2 = b * (1 + v2/c) / lambda_obs.

Since v1 is zero, T1 = b / lambda_obs.

T2 = b * (1 + 0.023333) / lambda_obs = T1 * 1.023333.

So, the previous calculation is correct.

So why do I not get an option around 2.05?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the observed luminosities are not affected by the Doppler effect. But no, the question says the astronomers computed the luminosities from assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, but the intrinsic luminosity is calculated from their rest frame parameters.

Wait, but the problem says: the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. So perhaps they have to correct for the Doppler effect when determining the luminosity.

Alternatively, maybe the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The flux F is L/(4πd²), but that's about distance. Alternatively, the observed flux is F = (L / (4πd²)) * (1 + v/c) (for non-relativistic velocities), due to the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the problem states that they computed the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies. So perhaps the observed flux is F = (L / 4πd²) * (1 + v/c), which would imply that L is adjusted by (1 + v/c) to account for the Doppler shift. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the observed flux is F = (L / 4πd²) * (1 + v/c) for a star moving away (v positive). So if the observed flux is F, then the intrinsic luminosity would be L = F * 4πd² / (1 + v/c).

But the question states that the astronomers computed the luminosity, so perhaps L1 and L2 are the intrinsic luminosities, not the observed flux. So maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the computed luminosity is based on the star's rest frame (intrinsic) parameters.

Wait, but the problem says that the luminosities are computed assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the observed flux F is due to the star's intrinsic luminosity, adjusted by the Doppler effect. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the intrinsic properties of the stars, irrespective of their velocities, except that the observed peak wavelength is the same.

Wait, but in that case, the Doppler shift would have to be accounted for in their temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect and I should disregard the Doppler shift because the question says the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the stars have the same intrinsic temperatures?

Wait, that can't be, because if one is moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer, unless their intrinsic temperatures adjust.

Wait, but the question says the observed wavelengths are the same, which implies that after Doppler shift, they appear at the same lambda. So their intrinsic (rest) lambdas must be different.

So, the approach I took earlier is correct.

But then the calculation gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are so high that a linear approximation isn't sufficient, and I should use the exact Doppler formula.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But wait, perhaps when the velocity is towards us, it's a blueshift. If the velocity is away, it's a redshift.

In the case where v is 700 km/s away, so positive.

So, let's compute (1 + v/c) = 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.3333.

Wait, no: 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 700 km/s = 700 * 1e3 m/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So, v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So, (1 + v/c) = 1.023333.

So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

= lambda_rest * sqrt( (1.023333) / (0.976667) )

Compute the ratio inside sqrt:

1.023333 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.048.

So sqrt(1.048) ≈ 1.02366.

So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * 1.02366.

So, lambda_rest = lambda_obs / 1.02366 ≈ 0.9765 * lambda_obs.

So, lambda_rest for Star_2 is 0.9765 * lambda_obs.

Therefore, T2 = b / lambda_rest ≈ b / (0.9765 lambda_obs) ) = (1 / 0.9765) * (b / lambda_obs) ) ≈ 1.024 * T1.

Because T1 = b / lambda_obs.

So, T2 ≈ 1.024 * T1.

Now, computing L1/L2 again.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4)

= (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1.024)^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.024)^4 )

Compute (1.024)^4.

1.024 squared is approximately 1.048576.

Then, square that: (1.048576)^2 ≈ 1.0996.

So, (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.0996.

So, 1/(1.0996) ≈ 0.9096.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9096 ≈ 2.0436.

Again, about 2.04, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm. Then perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't affect the luminosity as computed from the black body spectrum because the star's own frame is considered. So, perhaps the question intended that we ignore the Doppler shift in the luminosity calculation, considering only the radius and mass, which don't directly affect the star's luminosity.

Wait, but the mass isn't directly relevant for luminosity as per the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Mass relates to other properties like radius and temperature via models like the mass-luminosity relation, but in this problem, we are given radius and mass, but perhaps we don't need the mass since R and T are given.

Wait, but the problem gives the masses, perhaps to confuse. Because if the mass is 1.5 times, but radius is 1.5 times, perhaps it's a main-sequence star, so the mass and radius are related. But since we have R and computed T, perhaps the mass isn't needed.

So, if I completely disregard the Doppler shift (maybe the question intended that radial velocities don't affect the calculation because the problem is about black body luminosity), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. That is option A.

But the question says the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same—so that must mean that the Doppler effect is considered, which adjusts their temperatures, hence their luminosities.

But according to that, the answer isn't among the options. Which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity. So when calculating the intrinsic luminosity, the observed flux is F = L/(4πd²) * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity.

But the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2's by a factor.

Wait, but if the observed flux is used to compute luminosity, then L = 4πd² F, which would be L = 4πd² F_obs. But if F_obs is affected by Doppler (F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v/c)), then L = 4πd² F_rest (1 + v/c) → but if L is the intrinsic luminosity, then L = 4πd² F_rest. So, perhaps they have to correct for the Doppler shift when computing L.

But the problem states that the luminosities are computed as black bodies, which would involve their own R and T, not the observed flux.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity doesn't affect the luminosity since it's an intrinsic property. So, despite the Doppler shift, the luminosity is based on R and T.

But how does the Doppler shift affect T? Because if a star is moving away, the observed T is lower (since lambda_max is longer). But the problem says the observed lambda_max are same for both. So, the T computed from the observed lambda_max would be same for both stars, but their intrinsic T would be different.

Wait, no—because T is computed from the observed lambda_max via T = b / lambda_obs. So, if both have same lambda_obs, their T would be same. But that's not considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify:

If a star is moving away, the observed lambda_max is longer than the intrinsic (rest) lambda_max.

So, if both stars have the same observed lambda_max, their intrinsic lambda_max must be different.

In the case of Star_1, which is not moving, lambda_obs = lambda_rest1.

Star_2 is moving away, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c).

Thus, lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c).

But T is proportional to 1/lambda_rest. So, T1 = b / lambda_rest1, T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

So, T2 = (1 + v/c) * T1.

So, T2 is higher than T1.

So, when computing luminosity, L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1*(1 + v/c))^4 )

= (2.25 R2² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4 )

= 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4.

As v/c is 0.023333,

1 + v/c = 1.023333.

So,

(1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.0517.

But the options don't have ~2.05.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/(1.023333)^4 more accurately.

Using a calculator, 1.023333^4 = let me compute it precisely.

Compute 1.023333^2 first: 1.023333 * 1.023333.

= 1.023333 * 1 = 1.023333,

1.023333 * 0.023333 = approximately 0.023772.

So total is 1.023333 + 0.023772 ≈ 1.047105.

Now, 1.047105 * 1.047105:

= (1 + 0.047105)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.047105) + (0.047105)^2

= 1 + 0.09421 + 0.002218 ≈ 1.096428.

So, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.096428.

So, 2.25 / 1.096428 ≈ let me compute that.

1.096428 × 2.05 = ?

1.096428 * 2 = 2.192856.

1.096428 *0.05=0.0548214.

Total 2.192856 + 0.0548214=2.247677.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 2.05 * 1.096428 ≈ 2.247677, which is just slightly less than 2.25.

So, 2.25 / 1.096428 = 2.05 + (0.002323 / 1.096428) ≈ 2.05 + 0.00212 ≈ 2.05212.

So, L1/L2≈2.052.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake, because the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it without approximating the Doppler shift.

Let me compute (1 + v/c) exactly.

v = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c =3e8 m/s.

v/c =7e5 /3e8 =7/300 ≈ 0.0233333333.

So, (1 + v/c) =1.0233333333.

So, (1.0233333333)^4.

Compute with more precision.

Compute 1.0233333333^2:

= (1 + 0.0233333333)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.0233333333) + (0.0233333333)^2

= 1 + 0.0466666666 + 0.000544444444

= 1.047211111.

Now, compute (1.047211111)^2.

= (1 + 0.047211111)^2

= 1 + 2*0.047211111 + (0.047211111)^2

= 1 + 0.094422222 + 0.002228777.

Adding: 1 + 0.094422222 = 1.094422222; plus 0.002228777 gives 1.096651.

So, (1.0233333333)^4 ≈ 1.096651.

So, 2.25 / 1.096651 = let me compute.

2.25 ÷ 1.096651.

Let me compute 1.096651 * 2.05 = 2.25.

As before, 2.05 *1.096651 = 2.25.

So, 2.25 /1.096651=2.05.

So, 2.05 is the calculated ratio.

But the options are A:2.25, B:2.32, C:2.35, D:2.23.

So none match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the inverse? If the denominator is (1 + v/c)^4, and I have v as redshift, perhaps I should compute it as (1 + (v/c)) for Star_2, but perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, and in the formula, if the velocity is towards us, v is negative. But the problem states the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. It doesn't specify direction, but typically radial velocity is positive when moving away.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity causes a blueshift, which would imply a negative v, but the problem says Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So perhaps it's moving towards us, which would make v negative.

Wait, let me think again. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then v is negative, so (1 + v/c) = 1 - (700e3)/(3e5) ) = 1 - 0.023333 = 0.976667.

So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) = lambda_rest * 0.976667.

But in this scenario, lambda_obs is shorter than lambda_rest, so the star would appear hotter.

If both stars have the same observed lambda_max, then Star_2's lambda_rest is longer.

Wait, but this seems contradictory. Let me redo the scenario.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v is negative. So (1 + v/c)= 0.976667.

Then, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * 0.976667 → lambda_rest = lambda_obs / 0.976667 ≈ 1.024 * lambda_obs.

So, T2 = b / lambda_rest = b / (1.024 lambda_obs) ) = T1 / 1.024 ≈ 0.9766 T1.

But then, Star_2 would have a lower T than Star_1, which is not possible because Star_2's observed lambda_max is same as Star_1's.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me clarify:

If both stars have the same observed lambda_max, lambda_obs.

Star_1 has v1=0 → lambda_rest1= lambda_obs.

Star_2 has v2=700 km/s, but if it's moving towards us, v is negative, so (1 + v/c) = 1 - 700e3/(3e5) )= 0.976667.

So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest2 * 0.976667 → lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs / 0.976667 ≈ 1.024 * lambda_obs.

So, T2 = b / lambda_rest2 ≈ b / (1.024 lambda_obs ) = (1 / 1.024) * (b / lambda_obs ) = 0.9766 * T1.

So, T2 < T1.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (T1^4 / (0.9766 T1)^4 )

= 2.25 * (1/(0.9766)^4 )

Compute 0.9766^4:

0.9766^2 = approx 0.9537.

Then, 0.9537^2 ≈ 0.9096.

So, (0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.9096.

So, 1/0.9096 ≈ 1.1.

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.1 ≈ 2.475.

Which is option B or C. Option B is ~2.32, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Compute 0.9766^4.

0.9766^2 = 0.9766 * 0.9766.

= (0.97 * 0.97) + (0.97 * 0.0066)*2 + (0.0066)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using exponents.

0.9766^2:

= (1 - 0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0234 + (0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0468 + 0.000548 ≈ 0.953748.

Then, 0.953748^2.

= (0.95)^2 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.003748 + (0.003748)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.006746 + 0.000014 ≈ 0.90926.

So, 0.9766^4 ≈ 0.90926.

So, 1/0.90926 ≈ 1.1.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.1 = 2.475. Hmm, that's higher than the options given. So that's not matching either.

Wait, but this approach gives a higher ratio, but the options don't go that high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler shift, so L1/L2 is simply (1.5)^2=2.25, which is option A.

But then the part about the observed wavelengths being same wouldn't affect the calculation, which seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the luminosity accounts for the Doppler shift in terms of flux. So the observed flux F is related to L by F = L/(4πd²) * (1 + v/c), but then the luminosity would be L = F *4πd²/(1 + v/c).

But I'm not sure how that would change the calculation. Because if both stars are at the same distance, but Star_2 is moving away, its observed flux would be lower, so when computing luminosity, it would be L = F *4πd²/(1 + v/c).

But the problem doesn't mention distance, so perhaps that's irrelevant.

I'm really stuck here. So perhaps it's best to go back to the problem statement.

The problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming black body radiation. So, I think the Doppler shift affects the temperature calculation.

But according to that, the ratio is about 2.05, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another angle: perhaps the Doppler shift isn't affecting the temperature because the observed maximum brightness is used, which already accounts for the shift. So the temperatures are same because the observed wavelengths are same.

Wait, but that can't be, because the observed wavelength depends on the star's velocity.

Wait, no, if both stars have same observed lambda_max, then their T_obs would be same, but their intrinsic T would be different based on their velocities.

But this is getting me into circles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for L1/L2 without considering the Doppler shift, which would give 2.25, option A. But that seems to ignore part of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me redo the calculation without considering Doppler.

R1 = 1.5 R2.

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

If T is same for both (if observed wavelengths are same and Doppler shift is ignored), then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But the problem includes Doppler shift, so the correct approach must involve considering it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the velocities as a factor in the Doppler shift, but since the observed lambda_max is same, the effective temperatures are same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 =2.25.

But that would be ignoring the Doppler's effect on T.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are redshifts but the effect is negligible, and the correct answer is 2.25.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2.23, which is close to 2.25.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial approach. Let me recompute the ratio when considering Doppler.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.023333)^4 more accurately.

1.023333^4 = (1.023333^2)^2.

1.023333^2 = 1.04721111.

1.04721111^2: let me compute it precisely.

= 1.04721111 * 1.04721111.

Compute this as:

1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816,

1.04 *0.00721111 = 0.007458,

0.00721111 *1.04 = 0.007458,

0.00721111^2 ≈ 0.00005199.

So,

1.04721111^2 ≈ 1.0816 + 0.007458 + 0.007458 + 0.00005199 = 1.0816 + 0.014916 + 0.00005199 ≈ 1.096568.

So, 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.096568.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.096568 ≈ 2.051.

Hmm, which is about 2.05, but the options don't have this.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in considering whether Star_2's velocity is towards or away. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then (1 + v/c) would be 1 - 0.023333 = 0.976667.

So, (1 + v/c) for Star_2 is 0.976667.

Thus, T2 would be T1 * 0.976667.

Wait, no:

Wait, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c).

If v is negative (moving towards us), (1 + v/c) is 0.976667.

So, lambda_rest = lambda_obs / 0.976667 = 1.024 * lambda_obs.

Thus, T = b / lambda_rest = 1/(1.024) * b / lambda_obs = 0.9766 * T1.

So, T2 = 0.9766 * T1.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) = (2.25) * (1/(0.9766)^4).

Compute 0.9766^4: as before, it's approximately 0.9096.

So, 1/0.9096 ≈ 1.1.

Thus, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.1 = 2.475, which is higher than any options.

Wait, but the options given are ~2.23, which is close to 2.25.

Hmm, this is perplexing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I used (1 + v/c) instead of (1 - v/c) for the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me clarify the Doppler shift formula.

The exact formula for wavelength when source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But if the source is moving towards the observer, v is negative, so:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - |v|/c)/(1 + |v|/c) )

Which would make lambda_obs < lambda_rest.

So, in this case, Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, the calculation would be:

lambda_rest = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, for v =700 km/s,

v/c = 700e3 /3e5 = 0.023333.

So,

lambda_rest = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1-0.023333)/(1+0.023333) )

= lambda_obs * sqrt( 0.976667 / 1.023333 )

= lambda_obs * sqrt( 0.954545 )

≈ lambda_obs * 0.9771.

So, lambda_rest = 0.9771 * lambda_obs.

Thus, T = b / lambda_rest = (1/0.9771) * (b / lambda_obs ) ≈ 1.0235 * T1.

So, T2 = 1.0235 * T1.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (1/(1.0235)^4 )

= 2.25 / (1.0235)^4.

Compute (1.0235)^4:

1.0235^2 = approx 1.0476.

1.0476^2 = approx 1.0969.

So, 1.0235^4 ≈ 1.0969.

Thus, 2.25/1.0969 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result as before.

But the options don't have this.

Another thought: perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler shift because it's small, and thus the answer is (1.5)^2=2.25, option A.

But the question mentions that the astronomers found the same observed wavelengths, which suggests that Doppler shift must be accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the inverse of (1 + v/c) in the luminosity ratio.

Wait, let me think again.

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v/c).

Thus,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v/c))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1/(1.023333))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (approx 0.9118).

So, 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ 2.051.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to compute the flux ratio, not the luminosity. Because flux would be F = L/(4πd²), and if they're at same distance, F ratio = L ratio. But if not, it's more complex.

But the question says they computed the luminosity, so I think it's about L.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are in the opposite direction, but that doesn't change the ratio.

At this point, perhaps the intended answer is simply (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But the options have other choices. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is considered, but I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps considering the mass-luminosity relation.

The mass-luminosity relation is L ~ M^3.5 or something, but the problem gives R and M, but if R is 1.5 times and M is 1.5 times, perhaps using L = sigma T^4 R², and T is same because observed lambda_max same. So, L1/L2= (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But that ignores Doppler.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: ~2.23.

Wait, 2.25 / 1.09665 is approximately 2.05, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 2.25 / 1.09665.

1.09665 × 2.05 = 2.2476775.

Which is 2.25 - 2.2476775 = 0.0023225 less than 2.25.

So, 2.05 + (0.0023225 / 1.09665) = 2.05 + 0.00212 ≈ 2.05212.

Which is about 2.05. So, not matching options.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the approximate relation (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.023 and (1.023)^4 ≈ 1.096, but then 2.25/1.096 = approx 2.05.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift and thus the answer is 2.25, option A.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are so high that non-relativistic Doppler shift isn't sufficient, but that's unlikely as 700 km/s is much less than c.

In conclusion, the correct approach includes considering the Doppler shift, which leads to L1/L2 ≈2.05, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option D: ~2.23, which is close to 2.25, but not matching precisely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, let me compute (1.0233333333)^4 accurately.

Using a calculator, 1.0233333333^4 is approximately 1.09654.

So, 2.25 /1.09654 ≈ 2.051.

Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler shift. So, the answer is option A:2.25.

But the question specifically states that the observed wavelengths are same, which implies Doppler must be considered.

Given the options, and perhaps a miscalculation on my part, the closest option to 2.05 isn't present, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the Doppler shift in terms of the observed flux, but the luminosity is computed without it. So, the observed flux F is lower for Star_2 because it's moving away, but the luminosity would be computed as F * 4πd²/(1 + v/c).

But if they're at the same distance, then L1 = F1 *4πd², and L2 = F2 *4πd²/(1 + v/c).

But without knowing the distance, perhaps it's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux F is F = L/(4πd²) * (1 + v/c), so L = F *4πd² * (1 + v/c). So, if Star_2 has higher (1 + v/c), its computed L would be higher.

But in that case, the ratio would be different.

But without knowing F, it's hard to compute.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick one. Since both stars have same observed lambda_max, their T is same. So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 =2.25, option A.

But that would mean the Doppler shift isn't affecting the calculation because the T is same, but that's not correct because the Doppler shift affects the intrinsic T.

Wait, but if both stars have same observed T, then their intrinsic T's would be different, but we're using the observed T to compute L.

Wait, but that's not the case. Because the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming black body, which would use their own R and T, not the observed T.

So, I'm really not sure. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option D: ~2.23, which is close to 2.25, and perhaps the correct calculation leads to that.

But given my calculations, I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B:2.32, which is approximately 2.25 * (1/(0.976667)^4).

Wait, 0.976667^4 is about 0.9096.

2.25/0.9096≈2.47, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1.0233^4 precisely.

Using a calculator, 1.0233^4.

1.0233^2 = 1.0474.

1.0474^2 = approximately 1.0969.

So, 1.0233^4 ≈ 1.0969.

So, 2.25 / 1.0969≈2.05.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the only possible conclusion is that the intended answer is option D: ~2.23. But I can't see how to get that from the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass and radius. But the problem states that both have same factor of 1.5, so R1=1.5 R2 and M1=1.5 M2. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't a factor. So, I think the mass is a red herring.

In conclusion, perhaps the intended answer is option B: ~2.32, but I can't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So, (T1/T2) = 1/(1.0233).

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1/(1.0233))^4.

Compute 1.0233^4 = 1.0965.

So, 1/1.0965≈0.9118.

So, 2.25 * 0.9118≈2.05.

But again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for (1 + v/c).

Wait, 1/(1 + 0.023333) ≈ 0.977.

So, (1/(1.023333)) ≈0.977.

So, (0.977)^4 ≈ (approx 0.977^2=0.9545; then 0.9545^2=0.9108).

So, 2.25 * 0.9108 ≈2.049, which is about 2.05.

So, no match.

Given that the options don't include 2.05, perhaps the intended answer is option D: ~2.23, which is close to 2.25. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B: ~2.32.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift is considered in the observed flux, thus F = L (1 + v/c).

So, L = F / (1 + v/c).

So, L1 = F1 /1,

L2= F2/(1 + v2/c).

But if the observed F is same, then L1/L2 = (1 + v2/c).

But the question doesn't state that the observed flux is same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the observed maximum brightness is same, which implies same flux, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for flux considering Doppler shift, leading to L = F *4πd² (1 + v/c).

But without knowing d, I can't proceed.

In the end, I think the intended answer is option D: ~2.23, but I'm not sure how to reach it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (1.023333)^4.

Compute step by step:

1.023333^1 =1.023333.

1.023333^2=1.023333 *1.023333.

= 1 *1 =1.

1 *0.023333 =0.023333.

0.023333 *1=0.023333.

0.023333 *0.023333=0.000544.

So, adding: 1 + 0.023333 + 0.023333 +0.000544=1.047207.

Now, 1.047207^2=?

= (1 +0.047207)^2.

=1 + 2*0.047207 + (0.047207)^2.

=1 +0.094414 +0.002228.

=1.096642.

So, (1.023333)^4=1.096642.

Thus, L1/L2=2.25 /1.096642≈2.051.

Still leads to ~2.05.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option D: 2.23.

But I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Astronomers are tasked with determining the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their given properties. Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and a mass \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \). The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that their observed temperatures are the same. However, the radial velocities of the stars are \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_1 and \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_2. The Doppler effect must be accounted for to determine the intrinsic temperatures of the stars.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). Since the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, the luminosity depends on the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning the observed temperatures \( T_{\text{obs}} \) are the same for both stars. However, the intrinsic temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) differ due to the Doppler effect.

3. **Doppler Effect**: The relationship between the intrinsic wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) and the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is given by:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   For small velocities (\( v \ll c \)), this can be approximated as:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), the intrinsic temperature of Star_2 is:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 / (1 + v_2/c) \), the ratio becomes:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(1 + v_2/c\right)^4
   \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( v_2/c = 700 \, \text{km/s} / 300,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.023333 \)
   - \( 1 + v_2/c = 1.023333 \)
   - \( (1.023333)^4 \approx 1.0966 \)
   - \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
   - \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 / 1.0966 \approx 2.051 \)

6. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated ratio \( \approx 2.05 \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **D) ~2.23**, which may account for rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
