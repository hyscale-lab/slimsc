Alright, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

Okay, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. Half of it (one hemisphere) has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. When only one hemisphere is spotted, photometric observations show brightness variations due to the star's rotation. The interesting part is that this setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of such a hypothetical planet relative to the star to produce the same brightness variation?

Hmm, so I think the key here is understanding the transit method used in detecting exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness—the transit method. The depth of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. 

But in this case, the star has spots instead of a planet. These spots are causing brightness variations as the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view. So the problem is essentially comparing the light curve variations caused by the spots with those caused by a planet transit. We need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Let me break this down. 

First, the star's radius is equal to the Sun's. I think the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the actual value isn't needed. But wait, does that matter? Maybe not, since we're comparing R_planet to R_star.

The spots cover 20% of a hemisphere. Wait, one hemisphere is covered 20% in spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (π R_star^2) * (1/2) because it's one hemisphere. Oh wait, wait. Let me think. One hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So if one hemisphere has 20% coverage in spots, the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R_star²/2) )? Or wait, perhaps it's simpler to think in terms of the total surface area of the star. The total surface area is 4π R_star². One hemisphere is 2π R². So if 20% of that hemisphere is spots, the area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of that hemisphere. The hemisphere's area is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The star's total area is 4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, but the question says the spots are in one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots on the front hemisphere will come into view. So when the star rotates, the spots will come into the line of sight, causing a dip in brightness similar to a planet transit.

Wait, but how does the brightness vary? Let's think about the light curve. When the spots are facing us, they block some of the light. But the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the star's apparent brightness decreases. But wait, when the star rotates so that the spot area is on the limb (edge), the effect is less than when the spot is directly facing us. So the brightness variation is a function of how much of the spot is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but in the case of a planet, the transit is a simple geometric blockage. The dip is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_p² divided by the star's area, which is π R_star², so (R_p/R_star)^2.

But in the case of the spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler and cover a certain fraction of the star's surface. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and out of view. So the observed brightness variation depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by the spots that are visible from Earth as the star rotates.

Wait, but when the star is observed, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with the spots will come into view. So during the rotation, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and when it's facing away, we don't. But wait, no, because the star's rotation would cause the spotted area to move across the field of view, so the total change in brightness is the maximum when the entire spotted area is in front of the star.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation. 

In the planet case, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2. So the relative change is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In the spots case, the change in brightness is due to the spots being cooler. Wait, but the question states that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K (since the temp difference is 1000 K lower). So the spots emit less flux.

Flux from a star is proportional to T^4. So the star's total flux is 4π Rstar^2 * sigma T_eff^4. The spots have an area of 0.4 π Rstar² as I thought earlier, and their temperature is T_eff_spot = 5000 K.

So the total flux from the spots is 0.4 π Rstar² * sigma (5000)^4.

Without the spots, the flux from that area would be 0.4 π Rstar² * sigma (6000)^4.

So the difference in flux when the spots are visible is delta_F = 0.4 pi Rstar² sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4).

Wait, but actually, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. So the difference in brightness compared to when the spots are on the far side is delta_F. The total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi Rstar² sigma (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - delta_F = F0 - 0.4 pi Rstar² sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4).

So the relative change in flux is (F - F0) / F0 = [ -0.4 pi Rstar² sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4) ) ] / [4 pi Rstar^2 sigma (6000^4)] )

Simplify this: the Rstar², sigma terms cancel.

So (relative change) = [ -0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ) ] / [4 (6000^4) ) ]

Which becomes: - (0.4 / 4) * (6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4) )

The 0.4/4 is 0.1. So the relative change is -0.1 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4 )

Wait, but the amplitude of the variation would be the magnitude of this change, so 0.1 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 )

Wait, but let me compute that factor numerically.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4.

Compute 6000^4: (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4: (5e3)^4 = 625 *1e12 = 6.25e14.

So (6^4 -5^4) = (1296 - 625) = 671.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 6000^4 -5000^4 = (6^4 -5^4) * (1e3)^4 = (1296 - 625) * 1e12 = 671 * 1e12 = 6.71e14.

So 6000^4 is 1.296e15.

So (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 6.71e14 /1.296e15 ≈ 0.518.

So the relative change is 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518, or about 5.18% decrease.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.18%. 

But wait, the problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the same amplitude in the star's light curve would be caused by a planet transit. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of about 5.18% in brightness. 

The dip for a planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but none of the options are near 0.23. Hmm. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate (6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4).

Compute 6000 = 6e3, 5000=5e3.

6e3^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5e3^4 = (5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = (1.296 -0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So (6e3^4 -5e3^4)/6e3^4 =6.71e14 /1.296e15 = approx 0.518.

So 0.1 * 0.518 = 0.0518. So the relative change is about 5.18% decrease.

So the dip is 5.18% in the star's brightness when the spots are fully visible.

But wait, the dip caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, which is about 0.23. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: ~0.39 and option D: ~0.32. Hmm, none are near 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait a minute. The question says the spots are covering one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So how much of the spot area is visible at maximum? I think I made a mistake. Because the star is a sphere, when the spot is on the limb, only a small part is visible, and when it's in the center, the full area is visible.

Wait, so the maximum change in brightness isn't when the entire spot is visible, but when the spot is at the center of the star's disk. So perhaps I should model the spot as a circle on the star's surface and calculate the maximum possible dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spot is in front of the star. But the problem states that the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and the spots are fully visible. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is in front of us.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about it as the spot being circular and located on the equator.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. When the spot is in front, it blocks some of the light, but also emits less light from that area. Wait, no, the spot is part of the star's surface. So when the spot is on the surface, the flux from that area is lower. 

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when the spots are present, the star's total flux is reduced. So the variation in brightness when the star rotates can be modeled as the spot moving across the disk. The maximum dip is when the spot is fully in front, but the actual dip depends on the spot's position. But the problem states that the star has one hemisphere covered with spots, so when the star rotates, the entire hemisphere comes into view. So perhaps the observed brightness change is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, which would block a certain area.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the star's brightness variation being caused by the spot's area as a function of rotation. But the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the dip caused by the spots is similar to that of a planet transit, but that requires considering the area blocked.

Wait, but in the planet case, the dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2). But in the spot case, the dip is the fractional change in flux due to the spots. So perhaps the maximum dip is (area of spots) * (difference in flux per unit area), all over the total flux.

Wait, let me re-calculate. The star's total flux is F0 = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

The spots have an area of A = 0.2 * (pi Rstar^2) * (1/2) ), because one hemisphere is covered 20%. Wait, no. The total surface area of the star is 4 pi Rstar^2. One hemisphere is 2 pi Rstar^2. The filling factor is 20%, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So the flux from the spots when they're facing us is F_spots = A * sigma T_spot^4.

When the star is spotless from our perspective, the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F0 - (F0_spot - F_spots), wait no. Wait, the spots are part of the star's surface. So normally, without any spots, the flux from that area would be F0_area = A * sigma Teff^4. But since the spots are cooler, their flux is F_spots = A * sigma (Teff - delta T)^4.

So the difference in flux when the spots are visible is F0_area - F_spots = A sigma (Teff^4 - (Teff - delta T)^4).

But when the spots are not visible (e.g., when the star is rotating and that hemisphere is on the far side), the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F0 - (F0_area - F_spots).

Wait, no. When the spots are visible, you get F = F0 - (F0_area - F_spots) = F0 - F0_area + F_spots.

Wait, that might not be the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the spots cause a deficit in flux. So when the spots are facing us, the flux from that area is less than it would be without spots. So the total flux is F = F0 - (F0_spot - F_spot).

So the change in flux is delta_F = F0 - F = (F0_spot - F_spot) = A sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the relative change is delta_F / F0 = [A sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4] )

Simplify: [A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 ]

Since A is 0.4 pi Rstar^2,

= [0.4 pi Rstar^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 ]

The pi Rstar^2 terms cancel.

= (0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4 Teff^4 )

0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So it's 0.1 * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/(Teff^4 )

Which is the same as 0.1 * [1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ]

T_spot is 5000 K, Teff is 6000 K.

So [T_spot / Teff] = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, about 5.1775% dip in brightness.

Wait, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.18% when the spots are visible. 

But wait, the question is about the amplitude of the variation. So in the case of the spots, the dip is 5.18% when the entire spotted area is in front of the star. But in reality, as the star rotates, the spots move across the disk, so the brightness variation is more complex, but the maximum dip is around 5.18%.

For the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if we want the same amplitude (5.18%), then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, or about 0.23.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32, which is about 0.32, and option A: ~0.39.

Wait, but none of the options are near 0.23. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the spot area.

Wait, another thought: the star's rotation and the fact that only one hemisphere is spotty means that when the star rotates, the maximum coverage is when the entire spotty hemisphere is facing us. But perhaps the actual variation is smaller because the spots are moving across the disk.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude calculation I did is correct, but the options aren't matching, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the brightness variation as the difference between when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side. But that would be a larger variation. Wait, no—because the spots are cooler, when they are on the near side, the flux is lower than when they are on the far side.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum brightness. When the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is higher than when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side (so the cooler areas are not visible, and the star's surface is all at 6000 K). The minimum brightness is when the spots are on the near side (so the cooler spots are blocking some of the light).

Wait, but the star's brightness when the spots are on the far side is F_max = F0 + (F0_spot - F_spot), because when the spots are on the far side, their cooler flux isn't contributing. Wait, no, that's not correct. When the spots are on the far side, the flux from them isn't reaching us, but the flux from the rest of the star is at 6000 K. Wait, no—I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness is when none of the spots are visible, so the star's flux is F0. The minimum brightness is when the maximum area of the spots is visible. So the dip is F0 - F_min = F0 - (F0 - (F0_spot - F_spot)) ) = F0_spot - F_spot.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

The spots have an area A = 0.4 pi Rstar^2, and their flux contribution is F_spot = A sigma T_spot^4.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (F0_spot - F_spot) = F0 - F0_spot + F_spot.

So F = F0 - F0_spot + F_spot = [F0 - F0_spot] + F_spot.

But F0 - F0_spot is the flux from the rest of the star (non-spots) when the spots are not visible. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the difference in flux when the spots are on the near side versus when they're on the far side.

When the spots are on the far side, we don't see them. So the flux is F0.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 - (F0_spot - F_spot), because the spots contribute less flux than the surrounding area.

So the dip is delta_F = F0 - F = F0_spot - F_spot.

So the relative dip is (F0_spot - F_spot)/F0.

Which is:

F0_spot = A sigma Teff^4.

F_spot = A sigma T_spot^4.

So delta_F = A sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Thus, the relative dip is delta_F / F0 = [A sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4 ].

Simplify:

= [A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 ].

As before, A is 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So substituting:

= [0.4 pi Rstar^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 ].

Cancel terms:

= 0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (4 Teff^4).

= 0.1 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

= 0.1 (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4).

As before, this gives about 5.18% dip.

In the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, so:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

Looking at the options, there's no option near 0.23. The options are A: ~0.39, B: ~0.07, C: ~0.11, D: ~0.32.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the spot's area is 20% of a hemisphere. So one hemisphere is 2 pi R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the area is 0.4 pi R².

So A = 0.4 pi R². The star's total area is 4 pi R².

So the ratio A/(4 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but wait. The star's surface area is 4 pi R². The spotted hemisphere is 2 pi R², 20% of which is spotted. So 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the fraction is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, that can't be right because 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R², which is 10% of the star's total surface area.

So the area covered by spots is 10% of the star's surface.

So when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is F0. When they're on the near side, the flux is F = F0 - (F0_spot - F_spot).

So the dip is (F0_spot - F_spot)/F0, which we calculated as 5.18%.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's effect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effect of the spot's rotation across the disk, leading to a smaller amplitude.

Wait, maybe instead of the entire spot area being visible, only a small portion is visible at any time, leading to a smaller dip.

Wait, for example, when the spot is on the limb, only a small portion is visible, so the maximum dip would be when the spot is at the center.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spot would move across the disk. The maximum dip would be when the spot is at the center, and the minimum dip when it's on the limb.

But the problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So perhaps the variation caused by the spot's rotation is similar to the planet's transit. So the amplitude would be the maximum dip, which is when the spot is at the center.

Wait, but the spot's area is 10% of the star's surface. If the spot is a disk, the maximum dip would be when the entire area is in front. But for a disk, the dip is (R_spot/Rstar)^2. So R_spot = sqrt( A / pi ), where A is the area of the spot.

Wait, but the spot is 10% of the star's surface, so A = 0.1 *4 pi Rstar²? No, wait, the area of the spot is 0.4 pi Rstar². So the radius of the spot is sqrt( (0.4 pi Rstar²) / pi ) = sqrt(0.4 Rstar²) = Rstar * sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.632 Rstar.

Wait, that can't be right because then the spot would be larger than the star. No, wait, that's the area on the surface. If the star's radius is R, and the spot is a circle with area A=pi a², where a is the radius of the spot, then a = sqrt(A/pi) = sqrt(0.4 pi R² / pi) )= sqrt(0.4 R²) = R * sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.632 R.

So the radius of the spot is about 0.632 Rstar. So when the spot is at the center, it blocks an area of pi (0.632 Rstar)^2, which would cause a dip of (0.632 Rstar / Rstar)^2 = (0.632)^2 ≈ 0.4, or 40% dip. But that's way higher than the 5% we calculated earlier. So that can't be right.

Wait, no, because the spot's area is 0.4 pi R², which is 10% of 4 pi R². So when the spot is at the center, the dip would be 10% of the star's flux, which is 10% dip. But earlier I calculated a 5.18% dip because of the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I confused the absolute area with the temperature effect. So the spot's area is 10% of the star's surface, but the flux from the spot is lower. So the dip would be 10% multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

So the dip would be (10% ) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 10% * (1 - 0.48225) ≈ 10% * 0.51775 ≈ 5.1775%, which aligns with our earlier calculation.

Wait, so perhaps I should calculate the dip as the area fraction multiplied by the per-unit flux difference.

That is, dip = (A/(4 pi Rstar²)) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, or about 5.18%.

So the dip is 5.18% of the star's flux.

In the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't include this value. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) ~0.39
B) ~0.07
C) ~0.11
D) ~0.32

Hmm. None of these are close to 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's rotation speed and the spot's coverage affect the observed brightness variation differently. For example, the brightness variation due to spots might have a different amplitude than the planet's dip because the star's rotation modulates the spots in a way that the maximum dip is not when the entire spot is in front.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's position on the star as a single spot, not a hemisphere. Because in reality, stars can have multiple spots, but in this problem, it's one hemisphere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should model the spot as a single spot covering a certain area, not spread over a hemisphere. Because a hemisphere with 20% coverage would have multiple small spots, but maybe the problem is considering the spot as a single circular area.

Wait, but regardless, the area calculation should still hold. The total area is 0.4 pi R², which is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum possible dip when a spot of area A is in front. The maximum dip would be when the entire area is in front, so dip is A/(4 pi R²) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4.

Which is the same as what I did earlier, leading to a 5.18% dip.

So back to the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so 5000 K. So the per-unit-area flux is (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈0.482. So the per-unit-area deficit is 1-0.482 = 0.518.

The area of the spots is 0.4 pi R², which is 0.1 *4 pi R², so 10% of the surface.

So the total deficit when the spots are in front is 10% * 0.518 = 5.18% dip.

So planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot's area is 20% of the hemisphere, not 20% of the entire star. Wait, the problem states: 'one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.' So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, which is 0.2. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R², as I thought earlier. So that's 10% of the star's surface.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effect of the spot's position as it rotates, and the maximum dip is when the spot is at the center, but perhaps the planet's transit is a simple geometric block, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the brightness variation's amplitude, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, but in the case of the spot, the flux when the spots are on the far side is F_max = F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_min = F0 - (A sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)).

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / F0 = [A sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / (4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4 )

Which simplifies to the same 5.18% as before.

So the planet would need to cause a dip of 5.18%, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the planet's transit as a partial transit, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the radius of the spots, not the planet.

Wait, no, the question is about the planet's radius relative to the star's to cause the same amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4. Let me compute that again.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^4 = ?

Compute 0.8333^2 = approx 0.6944. Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.48225. So that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The brightness variation due to the spot is the same as the planet's. So the area of the planet must be equal to the area of the spot. Because the dip is determined by the area blocked.

So the area of the planet is π (Rp)^2. The area of the spot is 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

Set π Rp^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2 → Rp^2 =0.4 Rstar^2 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.632. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but that approach ignores the temperature difference. So perhaps it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot's area is 10% of the star's surface, but the planet's area would need to block the same fraction of light, considering the temperature difference. So the planet's area times the star's flux per unit area must equal the spot's area times the temperature difference flux.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think.

The flux blocked by the planet is the area of the planet times the star's flux per unit area, which is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

The flux blocked by the spot is the area of the spot times the difference in flux per unit area, which is A * (F0/A_spot - F_spot/A_spot) → A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 * sigma.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set the flux blocked by the planet equal to the flux blocked by the spot.

Flux_blocked_planet = (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

Flux_blocked_spot = A * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 * sigma.

Set them equal:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0 = A * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 * sigma.

But F0 = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

So substituting:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 *4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4 = A * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma.

Cancel sigma from both sides.

(Rp/Rstar)^2 *4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 = A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Divide both sides by Teff^4:

Rp^2 *4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^0 = A (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

Rearranged:

Rp^2 = [A (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ) ] / (4 pi Rstar^2 )

So Rp = sqrt( [A (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ) ] / (4 pi Rstar^2 ) )

But A is the spot area, which is 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

Substituting:

Rp^2 = [0.4 pi Rstar^2 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ] / (4 pi Rstar^2 )

Simplify:

Rp^2 = [0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ] /4.

= [0.4 * 0.51775 ] /4.

= (0.2071) /4 = 0.051775.

So Rp^2 = 0.051775 → Rp = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276 Rstar.

Again, the same result. So the planet's radius is approximately 0.2276 Rstar, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the planet's transit cause the same change in brightness as the spot's effect, but considering the spot's position and rotation, the amplitude is smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's rotation and that the maximum dip is not 5.18% but less, depending on the spot's position.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum dip as when the spot is at the center, which would block a certain amount of light, and the planet's transit would cause the same dip.

So, the area of the spot is 0.4 pi R². The area of the planet is pi Rp².

Setting pi Rp² = 0.4 pi R² → Rp² = 0.4 R² → Rp = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. So Rp/Rstar ≈0.632. But again, not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the spot's rotation in a way that resembles a planet's transit, but the spot's effect is spread out over the rotation period, leading to a smaller amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation's amplitude depends on the rotational period and the spot's size, but that's not the case. The amplitude is determined by the area blocked and the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered with spots, 20% filling factor. The star's Teff is 6000 K, spots are 5000 K. The situation can resemble an exoplanet transit, so what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in brightness variations.

So the amplitude is the same when the star is covered by spots as when a planet transits. The amplitude is the relative change in brightness.

In the planet case: delta_F_planet = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In the spot case: delta_F_spot = (A/(4 pi Rstar²)) * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4).

Set delta_F_planet = delta_F_spot:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = (A/(4 pi Rstar²)) * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4).

A is 0.4 pi Rstar², so A/(4 pi Rstar²) = 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a single large spot instead of covering a hemisphere. Let me try that.

If the spot is a single spot with an area of 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R², as before. So same result.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness variation as the star rotates. The spot moves across the disk, causing a varying dip. The amplitude of the brightness variation would then be the maximum dip minus the minimum dip, which occurs when the spot is on the edge.

Wait, but when the spot is on the edge, the visible area is a small segment, not the entire spot. So the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully in front, which is the case when the entire hemisphere is visible. But that's what I did earlier.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the planet relative to the star's radius, but considering the planet's transit as a partial transit because the spot is only on one hemisphere. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the area of the spot and the planet's area to be the same, leading to Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.632. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is ~0.32, which is about sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is about 0.32. Wait, sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's area to be 10% of the star's surface. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.316. Which matches option D.

But why would that be the case? Because the spot's area is 10% of the star's surface, so the planet's area would have to be the same to cause the same dip. But this ignores the temperature difference.

Ah, I see! Because the problem states that the spot's temperature is lower, the planet's transit would need to block a smaller area to cause the same dip as the spot. Because the dip due to the spot is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but the spot's effect is (A/(4 pi Rstar²)) * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4), which is less than (A/(4 pi Rstar²)).

So to get the same dip as the spot, the planet's area must be larger than the spot's area, not smaller.

Wait, no. Let's think: the dip caused by the spot is (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.0518. The planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So to get the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But option D is 0.32, which is about 0.32. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area as a single spot, not spread over a hemisphere. Let me recalculate.

If the spot is 20% of the star's surface, then A = 0.2 *4 pi Rstar² = 0.8 pi Rstar².

Wait, but that would make the spot cover 20% of the entire star, which is a very large area. The radius of such a spot would be sqrt(0.8 pi Rstar² / pi ) = sqrt(0.8 Rstar^2) ≈ 0.894 Rstar. That's even larger than the star itself, which is impossible.

So that can't be right. So the initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot's area is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So A =0.2 *4 pi Rstar² =0.8 pi Rstar^2. Then the dip is (0.2) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 *0.51775 ≈0.1035. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.3218. So ~0.32, which matches option D.

Ah! That must be it. So perhaps I misread the problem, and the spot covers 20% of the star's entire surface, not just one hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: 'one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.' So the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2 pi R² =0.4 pi R². Which is 10% of the star's surface.

But if someone misreads the problem and thinks that the spot covers 20% of the star's surface, then A=0.2 *4 pi R² =0.8 pi R². Then the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈0.1035. So Rp^2=0.1035 → Rp/Rstar≈0.3218, which is option D.

So perhaps that's the intended approach. So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**: The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), giving \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Spot Area**: The total surface area of the star is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). One hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). With a filling factor of 20%, the area of the spots is:
   \[
   A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
   \]
   This corresponds to 10% of the star's total surface area.

3. **Brightness Variation**: The brightness variation caused by the spots depends on the temperature difference and the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. The relative change in brightness when the spots are visible is:
   \[
   \Delta F / F_0 = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
   \]
   Substituting \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \right)
   \]
   Calculating \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \), we find:
   \[
   \Delta F / F_0 \approx 0.1 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.051775 \, \text{(or 5.18%)}.
   \]

4. **Exoplanet Transit**: The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
   \[
   \Delta F_{\text{planet}} / F_0 = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
   \]
   To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.051775
   \]
   Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276
   \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem is interpreted as the spots covering 20% of the star's total surface area (instead of 20% of one hemisphere), the area of the spots becomes:
   \[
   A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
   \]
   This corresponds to 20% of the star's surface area. Recalculating the brightness variation:
   \[
   \Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \right) \approx 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
   \]
   Setting \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035 \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
   \]
   This matches option **D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the spots cover 20% of the star's total surface area rather than 20% of one hemisphere. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately **0.32**.
