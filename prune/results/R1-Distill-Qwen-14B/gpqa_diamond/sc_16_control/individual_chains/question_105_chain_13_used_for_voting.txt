Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see, the question is about a star with some dark spots affecting its brightness, and how that's similar to the signal from an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Hmm, so first, I need to understand what's happening with the star. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The spots are covering one hemisphere, and their filling factor is 20%. Oh wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots, right? So 20% of the star's surface is covered in dark spots.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, which is a bit hotter than the Sun, which is about 5778K. The spots are cooler, I assume, since they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000K. So the spots must be at 6000K - 1000K = 5000K? Or wait, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000K, but doesn't specify if the spots are hotter or cooler. Oh, dark spots are usually cooler, so yes, 5000K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, the brightness variation as the spots rotate into and out of view would cause a dip in brightness each time a spot is facing us. But because the spots are only on one side, the star's brightness might dip once per rotation, but since the spots cover a hemisphere, maybe the dip is a gradual change as more or less spots come into view as the star rotates.

Wait, no, actually, when a star with spots rotates, the spots that are on the surface modulate the light. If it's a single hemisphere, then as the star spins, we see the spotted side and the non-spotted side. So the brightness variation would depend on how much of the spotted area is visible. Hmm, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the varying brightness caused by the spots is similar to the dip caused when a planet transits in front of the star.

The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet (R_pl) relative to the star's radius (R_star) such that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the spotted star's variation.

So I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation when it transits.

Let me think about light curve amplitude. The amplitude is the change in brightness relative to the star's normal brightness. For a planet transit, the dip is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but in the case of spots, the variation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are visible (facing us), the star's overall brightness decreases. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum is when the maximum number of spots are visible.

Wait, no. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots will come into view. The brightness will dip when the spots are facing us. So the variation is due to the change in the area covered by the spots as seen from Earth.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the average brightness of the star would be a combination of the normal star and the spotted areas.

But when the star rotates, the amount of spots visible will change. Wait, no. Because the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, but if the star is rotating, then only parts of it will come into view. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the star's surface is spots. So when the star is viewed such that the spots are on the limb, perhaps the variation in brightness would be based on how much of the spots are visible as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the maximum and minimum brightness. Let's approach it step by step.

First, for the star with spots. The star's total brightness without spots would be L = 4πR² * sigma * T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law), but when spots are present, the brightness is reduced.

The spots have a temperature of T_spot = 5000 K. The rest of the star is at 6000 K.

The filling factor f is 0.2, so 20% of the surface is spots. So the total flux from the star is:

L_total = f * (4πR²) * sigma * T_spot^4 + (1-f) * (4πR²) * sigma * T_star^4

We can factor out 4πR² sigma:

L_total = 4πR² sigma [ f T_spot^4 + (1-f) T_star^4 ]

So without any spots, the brightness would be L0 = 4πR² sigma T_star^4.

The spots cause the brightness to vary as the spots rotate into view. Wait, no, the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere may come into view or not, depending on the observer's perspective.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation. If the spots are on one hemisphere, then as the star rotates once, the spots will be visible and then not visible from our perspective. Wait, no, because if the spots are on a single hemisphere, then the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into view and then go out of view as the star spins.

So when the star's face with spots is facing us, the brightness is lower, and when it's the other side, the brightness is higher. So the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal-like curve with a period equal to the star's rotation period.

But wait, the star's rotation period isn't given, but perhaps it's not needed since the problem is about the amplitude, not the period.

So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the entire spotted area is facing us. Wait, but the filling factor is 0.2, meaning the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible. So the flux when the spots are fully visible is:

L_min = L0 - (f L0) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) * (1 - f) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of fractional brightness change.

The fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible would be the difference between the star's brightness with and without spots. Wait, but when the star is not rotating, we see all the spots. So the brightness is lower. But when the star rotates such that the spot is on the far side, we see the brighter, unspotted surface.

Wait, no. The filling factor f is 0.2, so 20% of the surface is spots. So the average brightness is L_avg = L0 * (1-f) (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average brightness and the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, perhaps when the star is viewed such that the spots are on the limb (edge), only part of the spots are visible. Then, as the star rotates, the fraction of the spots visible changes, leading to a varying brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is because when the star rotates, the spots are sometimes in view and sometimes not. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the variation comes from the fact that when the spotted hemisphere is moving into or out of view, the apparent brightness changes. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, no, because the spot covers a hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots would come into view only when the star is rotated such that the hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted side is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

But wait, the star is a sphere. If the spots cover a hemisphere, then when the star rotates 180 degrees, the spots would be on the opposite side. So the brightness variation would be like a sine wave, with maximum brightness when the unspotted side is fully visible, and minimum when the spotted side is fully visible.

Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower. When the opposite hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the brightness is higher.

So the brightness variation would be a sine-like curve with a certain amplitude. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the maximum brightness (or something like that).

Wait, let me think about the maximum and minimum brightness. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted part is fully visible. The minimum is when the spotted part is fully visible.

So, the maximum brightness is L_max = (1-f) * L0 + f * (L_spot), where L_spot is the flux from the spots when they are visible.

Wait, no. Let me model the star's brightness more carefully.

The total flux without any spots is L0 = 4π R² σ T_star^4.

With spots covering 20% of the surface, the average flux is:

L_avg = 0.8 * L0 * (T_star^4) + 0.2 * L0 * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) * (T_star^4) ?

Wait, no. Because the flux from the spots is 0.2 * 4π R² σ T_spot^4.

Ah, okay, so the total flux when the spots are fully visible is:

L_spots_visible = 0.2 * 4π R² σ (5000)^4 + 0.8 * 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But wait, when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 50% of the surface? Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the spots are spread over the star, not a whole hemisphere.

Wait, the question states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots, and all of that is in one hemisphere. So if the star is a sphere, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². So all the spots are within the hemisphere, which has area 2π R². So 0.8 π R² is less than 2 π R², so the spots are entirely within the hemisphere.

Wait, but that's just the layout. So when the star is viewed from the direction of the spots, the spots are on the near side, and when it's viewed from the opposite direction, the spots are on the far side.

So the brightness variation would be maximum when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. So the difference in brightness between these two states would be the amplitude of the variation.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on with respect to the spots, only part of the spots would be visible. Hmm, no, in reality, when the star is rotating, the spots would come into view and go out of view as the star rotates, leading to a varying brightness. But I'm trying to model the amplitude, which is the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. So the brightness without any spots is L0, and when the spots are fully visible, the brightness is L_spots_visible.

So the dip in brightness is L0 - L_spots_visible.

Wait, no, the dip is the difference between the maximum brightness (L0) and the minimum brightness (L_min).

Wait, when the star is in a state where all the spots are facing us, the brightness is lower, so L_min = 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 * L0 + 0.8 * L0.

Wait, no. Let me compute that.

The total flux when the entire spotted area is visible is:

L_min = (0.2) * (5000/6000)^4 * L0 + (0.8) * L0.

Wait, yes, because 20% of the star's surface is at 5000K, and 80% remains at 6000K.

So the total flux is:

L_min = 0.2 * (5000^4 / 6000^4) * L0 + 0.8 * L0.

Similarly, when the entire spotted hemisphere is not visible (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us), the flux is L0.

So the maximum dip is ΔL = L0 - L_min.

But wait, L0 is the flux when the star is all at 6000 K. So let's calculate L_min.

Compute (5000/6000)^4:

5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 = 0.6944, then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.2 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.09646.

So L_min = 0.09646 * L0 + 0.8 * L0 = (0.09646 + 0.8) L0 = 0.89646 L0.

So the difference between L0 and L_min is L0 - 0.89646 L0 = 0.10354 L0.

So the dip is about 10.354% of the star's brightness.

Wait, but wait. That's when the entire spotted area is visible. But when the star is rotating, perhaps the spots are only partially visible. Hmm, no, because the problem says the star is currently observed, and the situation is such that it can closely resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible.

Wait, but in reality, as the star rotates, the spots would come into view and the brightness would dip, but the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

So the amplitude A_spot is (L0 - L_min) / L0 = 1 - 0.89646 ≈ 0.10354, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but wait, considering that the spots are only on one hemisphere, perhaps the maximum dip isn't when the entire spotted area is visible, because when the star is viewed from the direction of the spots, the entire 20% is visible. But if the spots are on a hemisphere, perhaps when the star is viewed edge-on, only half of the spots are visible. Hmm, no, because the filling factor is 20% of the entire surface. So when the star is viewed from the direction of the spots, all 20% are visible. So the dip would be as calculated.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 10.35% of the star's brightness.

Now, for the exoplanet transit. The dip in brightness when the planet transits is given by the area blocked, which is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So the amplitude A_planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We want to find R_planet / R_star such that A_planet equals A_spot.

So,

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.10354

Taking square root,

R_planet / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and when the planet transits, the dip is the same. But the problem says that the spots cause a dip of about 10.35%, so the planet must cause the same dip.

So R_planet / R_star ≈ 0.32.

So the correct answer would be option D, ~0.32.

Wait, but let me think again. When the star has spots, the dip is 10.35%, so the planet's transit must cause the same dip. So planet radius is sqrt(0.1035) times R_star, which is approx 0.32 R_star.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere has dark spots with a **filling factor** of 20% (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total brightness without spots is \( L_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - With spots, the total brightness is:
     \[
     L_{\text{min}} = f \cdot L_0 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 + (1 - f) \cdot L_0
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
     \[
     L_{\text{min}} = 0.2 \cdot 0.4823 \cdot L_0 + 0.8 \cdot L_0 = 0.09646 \cdot L_0 + 0.8 \cdot L_0 = 0.89646 \cdot L_0
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta L = L_0 - L_{\text{min}} = L_0 - 0.89646 \cdot L_0 = 0.10354 \cdot L_0
     \]
     This corresponds to a brightness variation of approximately \( 10.35\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the radius ratio:
     \[
     A_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the spotted star (\( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.10354 \)):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10354
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10354} \approx 0.3218
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
