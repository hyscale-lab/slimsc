Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two numbers. So each option gives the KE of the muon and the neutrino, I suppose.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. I remember that neutrinos have very little mass, but in this case, since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Oh, but since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, equations time. Let's denote the rest masses as m_pi, m_mu, and m_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others, maybe we can approximate it as zero. But wait, in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can take m_nu = 0. That might simplify things.

But wait, the muon's mass is 105.7 MeV, and the pion's is 139.6, so the pion's mass is higher. The decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So the energy and momentum need to be conserved.

Let me write down the conservation equations.

Energy conservation: The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c². After decay, the energies are the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are equal, and the directions opposite.

Let me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu. The momenta as p_mu and p_nu. So p_mu = p (say), and p_nu = p as well but opposite direction.

The energy of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). Since we're working in units where c=1, maybe it's easier to ignore c for now and just use E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²). For the neutrino, if we take m_nu ≈ 0, then E_nu = p.

So the energy equation is m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

We can write this as m_pi = p + sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Let me denote m_pi as M, m_mu as m. So the equation becomes M = p + sqrt(p² + m²).

Hmm, let's solve for p.

Let me rearrange: sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p.

Square both sides: p² + m² = (M - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (M² - 2Mp + p²).

So p² + m² = M² - 2 M p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides: m² = M² - 2 M p.

Rearranged: 2 M p = M² - m².

So p = (M² - m²) / (2 M).

Plugging in the numbers: M is 139.6 MeV, m is 105.7 MeV.

So M² = (139.6)^2 ≈ 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that: 139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. Hmm, perhaps (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 ≈ 19488.16.

Wait but 139.6^2 = let me compute more accurately: 139 * 139 = 19321, 0.6^2=0.36, and 2*139*0.6=166.8. So (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16. Right.

Similarly, m^2 is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is 32.49. 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then 2 M p = 8315.67 → p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) → 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2: 279.2 * 29.7 = let's see, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So maybe around 29.7 or so.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(30-0.3) = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.3) = 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24. But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 23.43 higher. So 29.7 + (23.43 / 279.2) ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c. But wait, since we used units with c=1, the actual value would have units MeV/c, but in the equation, it's unitless, but I think I'm working in units where c=1, so perhaps the actual value is 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but in reality, when we write E = sqrt(p² + m²), the units are in MeV, p in MeV/c, so probably I should have taken that into account. Hmm, perhaps I should have kept track of units, but since all masses are in MeV/c², and p is in MeV/c, then E would be in MeV.

So, p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Then, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²). Plugging in the numbers: sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let's compute each part.

29.784^2 ≈ (30 - 0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ 887.086656.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So sum under sqrt is 887.086656 + 11172.49 = 12059.57665.

E_mu = sqrt(12059.57665) ≈ let's see, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.57) is a bit less than 110.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 = 12056.04. Hmm, that's very close to 12059.57.

So 109.8^2 = 12056.04, and the sum is 12059.57, which is about 3.53 higher. So 109.8 + delta. Let's compute (109.8 + x)^2 ≈ 12059.57.

Expanding: (109.8)^2 + 2*109.8*x + x^2 ≈ 12056.04 + 219.6 x ≈ 12059.57.

So 219.6 x ≈ 3.53 → x ≈ 3.53 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So E_mu ≈ 109.8 + 0.0161 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Wait, but the pion's mass is 139.6, and E_mu is about 109.8 MeV, which is less than the pion's mass, which makes sense because the neutrino must carry some energy.

So the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = M - E_mu = 139.6 - 109.816 ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait, earlier we found p = 29.784 MeV/c, and E_nu is p (since m_nu is negligible). So that makes sense.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is 109.816 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 ≈ 4.116 MeV.

KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu. Since m_nu is so small, we can approximate it as E_nu, so KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's close to what I've calculated: 4.116 ≈ 4.12 and 29.784 ≈ 29.8.

So the answer should be D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)) using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino's mass is assumed negligible (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
\]
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This implies that the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p.
\]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
The energy of the muon is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
For the neutrino, since \(m_\nu \approx 0\), its energy is:
\[
E_\nu = p.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]
Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
p \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
E_{\mu^+} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+}.
\]
Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = 109.816 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
KE_{\mu^+} \approx 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The energy of the neutrino is:
\[
E_\nu = p \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy:
\[
KE_\nu \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
