Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The setup: There's a spherical conductor with radius R, and it's uncharged, meaning it has no net charge. Inside this conductor, but not at the center, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance 's' away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is 'r', which is smaller than R. So the cavity is inside the conductor but not touching the center.

Now, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is 'l', and both L and l are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options give different expressions for E, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. First, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves. Also, the electric field inside a conductor is zero in electrostatic conditions. But wait, the conductor is uncharged here, so any induced charges must come from the charge inside the cavity.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, it will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Let me think. The inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the +q charge attracts opposite charges. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance that.

Wait, no. The conductor is initially neutral, so the total charge is zero. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have -q induced. Because the conductor must remain neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q, since the inner is -q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor. So the charges on the outer surface should distribute themselves spherically symmetrically. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution, so the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if the charge +q was at the center of the conductor. So, the field outside depends only on the total charge outside, which is +q.

So regardless of where the inner charge is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface will have +q, and the field outside would be the same as if the charge was at the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P should be calculated as if the charge +q was at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge creates a field as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but let me think about the setup. The cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted by s. So the charge +q is inside this cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has an induced +q. So from the outside, the field is due to this +q as if it's at the center of the conductor.

Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor would be the same as that produced by a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field there would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), right? Because that's the field of a point charge.

Looking at the options, option B is that expression.

Wait, but why are the other options present? Let me think again.

Option A: (q)/( (l - s cosθ)^2 )

Hmm, that seems like it's considering the distance from the charge inside the cavity. But wait, the charge outside is at the conductor's center, not the cavity's. So for an external point, the field is due to the outer charge, so the position of the inner charge shouldn't matter.

Wait, but the outer charge is a shell, so the field outside the shell is as if all the charge is at the center.

So the field at P would be due to the +q at the conductor's center, regardless of where the +q was placed inside the cavity. So P's distance from the center is L, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²), which is option B.

But why is l and other terms in the options? Because l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity, which is inside the conductor. But for an external point, the field shouldn't depend on where the cavity's center is, because the conductor's induced charges shield the interior.

Wait, another approach: The conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface would distribute in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. Because in electrostatics, the field inside a conductor is zero. So the point P is outside the conductor, so the field is due to the outer induced charge.

But then, the outer induced charge is +q, and it's on the surface of a sphere of radius R. So the field at any point outside is same as a point charge at the center.

So yes, E = k q / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀), so option B is correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the setup. The cavity is not at the center, so would that affect the outer induced charges? For example, in a spherical conductor, if the cavity is not at the center, would the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces be different?

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The inner surface must have a charge of -q (because the +q in the cavity induces that). The outer surface must have +q to balance, making the total conductor charge zero. But the outer charge is on the surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius R. So the outer charge distribution is symmetric, regardless of where the cavity is located.

So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the outer charge. Since the outer charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. Therefore, the position of the cavity (which is at a distance s from the center) doesn't affect the external field.

So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves a neutral, uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is not centered at the conductor's center but is shifted by a distance $s$, and its radius is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center. The distance from $P$ to the cavity's center is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) due to electrostatic induction. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, and this charge distributes uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor is therefore identical to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of the Cavity's Position**: The position of the cavity (and hence the charge $+q$ inside it) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the conductor's outer surface ensures that the field outside is solely due to the total charge $+q$, which is uniformly distributed on the outer surface.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Since the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge $+q$ at the center, and $P$ is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

Analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: This expression depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is unrelated to the electric field outside the conductor. The position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$ does not affect the external field.
- **Option B**: This matches the correct expression for the electric field outside a spherical conductor due to a point charge at its center.
- **Option C**: This expression depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also unrelated to the external field.
- **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge $+q$ at the center, and the cavity's position or angle does not affect the result.
