Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on a few factors, right?

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula, if I remember right, is something like the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size squared, divided by (distance from star)^2 or something like that. Or maybe it's more about the alignment. Oh wait, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a^2)), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on as seen from Earth. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a^2)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a^2)) ), but maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a^2)), where a is the semi-major axis. So higher R_p and smaller R_s and a would increase the probability.

Wait, but in this case, both planets have the same mass, but their radii might not be the same. Oh wait, the problem gives their masses but not the radii. Oh, wait, wait, no. The question says the planets have the same masses, but how does mass relate to radius? For gas giants, mass doesn't directly correlate with radius, but for Earth-like planets, I think density is similar, so radius would scale with mass^(1/3), since volume is proportional to mass for same density. So if both have same mass, their radii are same. So R_p is same for both.

Oh, but the stars have different masses but same radii. So R_s is same for both. So R_p/R_s is same for both.

Hmm, that simplifies things. So the probability then depends on a. P is proportional to (1/a^2). Because R_p and R_s are same, the only variable left is a.

But wait, the orbital period is given. Kepler's third law says that P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) a^3. Since P is the period, and M is the mass of the star, and m is the planet mass. But since M >> m (planets are much less massive than stars), we can approximate P^2 = (4π²/(G M)) a^3. So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M P^(2/3))^(1/3) = M^(1/3) P^(2/3 * (1/3))? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, Kepler's third law in the form a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3). So a = k * (M * P²)^(1/3), where k is some constant.

Since both planets have same mass, but their stars have different masses. Wait, no: the planets have the same mass, but the stars differ. So for each planet, a depends on their star's mass and their period.

Wait, but the given is that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

And the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

From Kepler's law: a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²). Since P is given for each, so for a1 and a2:

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2/3)^2 ) / (4π²)
a2^3 = (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / (4π² )

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ (2 M2) (P2²/9) ) ] / [ M2 P2² ) ] 
= (2 * (1/9)) ) = 2/9

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

Wait, wait: let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute 2^1/3 is about 1.26, 9^1/3 is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1/a2 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a^2), because the formula I thought earlier is P = (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a^2). Because the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance a.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The transit probability P is given by: 

P = (R_p / a)² * ( (R_s + R_p) / R_s )² ) ?

No, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / a)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / R_s )^0? No, I'm mixing it with other equations.

Wait, I think the transit probability is actually given by the ratio of the areas. The area that the planet can cover as seen from Earth is the area of the star's disk that the planet can block. The probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk. But that's only the geometric probability, which is (R_p / R_s)^2. But that's the probability only if the orbital plane is edge-on. However, the true probability depends on whether the inclination is such that the planet transits.

Wait, no, the actual probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits is given by (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the orbital plane can be at any angle. The probability is the ratio of the favorable cases (where the inclination is such that the planet's path crosses the star's disk) to the total possible inclinations.

So the probability P is approximately (R_p + R_s) / (a) * (R_s / a). Wait, no, I'm confusing more.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_s / a)^2. Or wait, I think I remember that the probability is (R_p + R_s) / (a), but I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the distance, because the orbital plane's inclination has to be within a certain range. So the probability is roughly (2 R_s) / (4 a) ) = (R_s)/(2 a), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another way: the maximum angle for transit is when the planet's orbit is edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the distance, so (2 R_s) / (4 a) ) ?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is the transit probability P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a). Wait, that would make P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a). But earlier I thought the same.

Wait, but in the question, R_p is same for both planets, R_s is same, so P is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, in the formula I've come across, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a) or something else?

Wait, let me take a step back. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. For a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s) )? Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, another way. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star (π R_s²) to the area of the sphere's cross-section (π a²). So that would be (R_s²) / (a²). Since R_s is the same for both stars, the probability is inversely proportional to a². So P ∝ 1/a².

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the inclination, I thought it was (R_s / a). Hmm, perhaps I need to get the correct formula.

Wait, I found a source in my notes: The probability of a transit is approximately (R_p + R_s) / (a), but since R_p << R_s, it's roughly R_s / a. But wait, that gives a linear relation. But another source says the probability is (R_p/(R_s))^2 * (R_s/a), which would make it (R_p^2) / (R_s a). Hmm.

Alternatively, I've seen that the transit probability is P = (R_p + R_s)/(a) * (R_s + R_p)/(a) )? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_s + R_p) / a. Because when the planet's orbital plane is inclined such that the planet passes in front, the maximum distance from the center is when the planet is at the edge of the star's disk. So the condition is that the semi-major axis a must be larger than R_s. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter (2 R_s) to the distance (2 a), which is (2 R_s)/(2 a) = R_s/a. So P = R_s / a.

Wait, that makes sense because if a is larger, it's less likely for the planet to pass in front. So the probability is proportional to 1/a.

Wait, but I've also read that the probability is approximately (R_p / (a))^2, but that seems different. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p + R_s) / a. But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

In this problem, both planets have same R_p (since same mass, assuming same density, same radius). The stars have the same radius, R_s. So R_p is same for both, R_s same for both.

So the probability for each planet depends on a. If the probability is proportional to 1/a, then the planet with smaller a has higher probability.

But from Kepler's law, a1 is about 0.6 a2. So a1 = 0.6 a2.

So P1 = (R_s / a1) = (same R_s) / a1 = 1/(0.6 a2) = 1.666... * (R_s/a2) = 1.666 * P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.66 times higher than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is preferred.

Wait, but what if the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a)? Let's see.

If P ∝ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1/a), then since R_p and R_s are same for both, P is proportional to 1/a. So same as before.

So for Planet_1: a1 = 0.6 a2. Therefore, 1/a1 = 1.666 * (1/a2). So P1 = 1.666 * P2. So the probability is higher for Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That matches 1.666, which is approximately 1.65.

Option D says ~2.7 times higher, which is not matching.

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the a1 and a2 calculations.

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3.

From Kepler's third law: a³ = (G M P²) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3) / [ M2 * P2^2 ]^(1/3)

Simplify numerator inside the cube root: 2 M2 * (P2^2 /9) = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

Denominator inside cube root: M2 P2^2.

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9) M2 P2^2 / (M2 P2^2) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So 1/a1 = 1/(0.606 a2) ) ≈ 1.649 * (1/a2).

So P1 = (R_s / a1) ≈ 1.649 * (R_s / a2 ) = 1.649 * P2.

Which is approximately 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the correct option is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_p}{a} \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of its orbit. Since both planets have the same mass and the stars have the same radius, \( R_p \) and \( R_s \) are the same for both systems. Thus, the probability depends only on \( a \), with \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M P^2 \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1, \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{(2M_2)(P_2/3)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \). Since \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \), the transit probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \approx \frac{1}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606 a_2} \approx 1.649 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2} = 1.649 P_2.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
