Okay, so there's this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to the distance to a star. The formula is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs. So as plx increases, the distance decreases, which makes sense because nearby stars have larger parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean uniformly in space, or uniformly in some other way? Oh, right, when they say uniformly distributed, I think it refers to number density, like the same number of stars per volume in space. So the number of stars in a certain volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density n is constant. Now, the question is about how the number per unit parallax range changes with plx. Let's think about how to relate parallax to the number of stars.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/d. So, as d increases, plx decreases. If I consider a shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by dr. So volume dV = 4πd² dr.

The number of stars in that shell would be the number density n multiplied by dV. So N = n * 4πd² dr.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx, which is 1/d. Let me change variables from d to plx. Let plx = p. Then d = 1/p, so when d changes by dr, p changes by dp. Let's find the relationship between dr and dp.

Differentiating d = 1/p, we get dr = -1/p² dp. Hmm, negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, which makes sense. But for the purposes of counting stars, I can take the absolute value, so dr = (1/p²) dp.

Substituting back into N:

N = n * 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p²) dp )

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The shell at distance d has a volume element dV = 4πd² dr. Since dr = (1/p²) dp, substitute d=1/p.

So d² = (1/p)^2, so dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Because dr is (1/p²) dp.

Wait, that makes dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, no. Let me redo that. dV is 4πd² dr. dr is (1/p²) dp because dr = -d (1/p²) dp (from differentiation), but we can ignore the negative sign. So dr = (1/p²) dp.

So dV = 4π (d^2) (dr) = 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p²) dp ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax p to p+dp is N = n * dV = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So it's N/(dp) = 4π n / p^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx range (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1 / plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3. So A would be the one.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the substitution? Let me think again.

Another approach: The number of stars in a certain range of parallax is the same as the number in a range of distance. So the number per unit distance is n * 4π d². Since plx is 1/d, the number per unit plx would involve how the number per unit distance changes with plx.

Alternatively, let's express the number per unit plx (dp) as N = n * 4π d² * (dr). But dr = (1/p²) dp. So substituting d = 1/p, dr = (1/p²) dp.

So, N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp) = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So N per unit dp is 4π n / p^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but why does each step make sense? Because as parallax increases (p increasing), the distance decreases, so each shell at higher p (closer in) has a larger volume but wait, no, because the shell's volume depends on d squared times dr. Since higher p is lower d, which makes d^2 smaller, but dr is larger? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, think about it in terms of how many stars there are at a given distance. If the number of stars is proportional to the volume (since n is constant), then the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d^2 dr. But when you change variables to p, since p = 1/d, the number of stars in a shell at p would be proportional to ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p² ) dp ), which is 1/p^4 dp.

So the number per unit p is ~ 1/p^4. So the correct answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density \( n \) is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (from differentiating \( d = \frac{1}{p} \)), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp,
\]

where \( n \) is the constant number density. The number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is therefore:

\[
\frac{N}{dp} = \frac{4\pi n}{p^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
