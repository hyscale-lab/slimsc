Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. Wait, in classical mechanics, you just subtract the speeds, but since these are relativistic speeds, I must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, that's because velocities don't just add up linearly when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Let me make sure I get this right. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. Wait, but from whose perspective? Oh, right, we're looking for the speed of one relative to the other. Let's say we want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So u would be the speed of B in the lab frame (0.5c), and v is A's speed (0.6c). Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem is about their relative speed. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Wait, wait, no. Because they're both moving in the same direction. So B is moving slower than A, so from A's frame, B would be approaching from behind, right?

Wait, no. Wait, actually, if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't as straightforward as subtracting. Let me get the formula right. The formula for the relative velocity u' when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction (u being the velocity of B relative to the lab, and v the velocity of A relative to the lab) is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no. Wait, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of B from A's frame. Because if you have object B moving at u relative to the lab, and the lab is moving at v relative to A, then the speed of B relative to A is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Wait, actually, wait. Let me think again. Suppose in the lab frame, object A is moving at velocity v = 0.6c, and object B is moving at u = 0.5c, same direction. So in the lab frame, B is slower than A. So from A's frame, how fast is B moving? Since they're in the same direction, we subtract. But because of relativity, it's not a simple subtraction.

So the formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, but substituting u=0.5c and v=0.6c, so u < v. So the numerator becomes negative, but speed can't be negative, so perhaps the absolute value is taken. Or maybe I got the order wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²) if we're finding the speed of B from A's perspective. Wait, no. Wait, in the lab frame, A is moving at v and B is moving at u. So in A's frame, the lab is moving at -v. So from A's frame, how fast is B moving?

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the velocity of B as observed from A's frame. The formula for transforming velocities is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, u is the velocity of B in the lab frame (0.5c), and v is the velocity of A in the lab frame (0.6c). So substituting, u' is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is (-0.1c). The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/0.7 = (-1/7)c ≈ -0.1429c. The negative sign indicates that in A's frame, B is moving in the opposite direction. But since the question asks for the relative speed, we take the magnitude. So it's approximately 0.1429c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a match.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, the system comprises two astronauts moving at those respective speeds. The total energy should be the sum of their relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy E is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for each astronaut, their energy is gamma_i * m_i c². So we need to compute gamma for each, multiply by their respective masses, add them up, and then sum.

Let me compute gamma for each.

For astronaut A: v = 0.6c. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²)/c²) ) = 1/sqrt(0.64) ) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * m_A c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: v=0.5c. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) )= 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = gamma_B * m_B c² = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute this more accurately. 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.464.

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says E=4.96. So that matches.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct option.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the relative velocity calculation. Because sometimes the order matters. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered A's frame and calculated the speed of B. Wait, in the lab frame, A is at 0.6c, B is at 0.5c. So from A's frame, the relative speed of B is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.1428c. But since speed is a positive quantity, it's 0.1428c. So yeah, that's approximately 0.14c, which matches option C.

And the energy part, 5.96 mc² is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. 

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one object moving at velocity \( u \) as observed from another object moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A moves at \( v = 0.6c \), and astronaut B moves at \( u = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since the question asks for the relative speed, we take the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### Energy of Astronaut A
For astronaut A, \( v = 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

The energy of astronaut A is:

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
For astronaut B, \( v = 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy of astronaut B is:

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
