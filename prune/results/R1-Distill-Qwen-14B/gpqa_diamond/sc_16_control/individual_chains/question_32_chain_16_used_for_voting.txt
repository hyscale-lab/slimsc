Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and this problem involves calculating energy based on relativistic speeds. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li normally has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6. But wait, let me double-check: Li has atomic number 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number is 6. But wait, I should confirm if that's correct. Oh, right, Li-6 is a stable isotope, so yeah, it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the nucleus is Li-6, and we're looking at its speed being 0.96 times the speed of light. We need to find the energy of the RHIC, which I think refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, in particle physics, when they talk about collider energy, I believe they're referring to the total energy, including rest mass energy. But wait, sometimes it might just be the kinetic energy. I need to clarify this.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC", and the options are in GeV. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). So I need to compute the total relativistic energy of the nucleus.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/(0.28) = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Each nucleon has a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), but when considering the nucleus as a whole, the mass might be slightly less due to the mass defect (binding energy). But for heavy ions, this mass defect is usually small compared to the total mass. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to approximate the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton, which is about 6 * 938 MeV/c².

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the rest mass would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV. But wait, I should remember that the exact mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of the binding energy. But if the problem doesn't provide the exact mass, perhaps they expect me to just use the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Alternatively, maybe the mass is given as the atomic mass, but I'm not sure. Wait, since the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Wait, let me think about the exact mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015121882 amu. But I need to convert that into energy in GeV.

So first, I should find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The conversion factor is 1 amu ≈ 931.5 MeV. So 6.015121882 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu.

Let me calculate that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.015121882 * 931.5 ≈ Let's compute that: 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.005121882 *931.5 ≈ about 4.76 MeV. So total is about 5589 + 9.315 +4.76 = 5603.075 MeV.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me do the exact calculation:

6.015121882 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu.

So 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015121882 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005121882 *931.5 = approximately 4.763 MeV.

So adding: 9.315 +4.763 = 14.078 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.078 = 5603.078 MeV.

Convert that to GeV: 5603.078 MeV = 5.603078 GeV.

So the rest mass energy (m0 c²) is approximately 5.6031 GeV.

Now, gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5 *5.6031 = 19.61085. The 0.0714 *5.6031 is about (approx 0.07 *5.6 is 0.392) but let me compute exactly:

0.0714 *5.6031 = ?

5.6031 * 0.07 = 0.392217.

5.6031 *0.0014 = 0.00784434.

Adding: 0.392217 + 0.00784434 = 0.40006134.

So the total E is approximately 19.61085 + 0.40006134 = 20.0109 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6031.

Let me compute 3 *5.6031 =16.8093.

0.5 *5.6031=2.80155.

0.0714 *5.6031 ≈ approx 0.400061.

Adding these together: 16.8093 + 2.80155 = 19.61085.

19.61085 + 0.400061 = 20.010911 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, our calculation gives approximately 20.01 GeV, but the option closest to that is C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me check gamma again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in gamma. Let's recalculate gamma. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2 is exactly 0.0784 because 28 * 28 is 784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.603078 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.603078 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute this as 5.603078 * (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857).

So 5.603078 *3 =16.809234.

5.603078 *0.5 =2.801539.

5.603078 *0.07142857 ≈ ?

0.07142857 is 1/14. So 5.603078 /14 ≈ 0.40022.

So adding them together:

16.809234 + 2.801539 =19.610773.

19.610773 + 0.40022 = 20.010993 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the mass should be calculated as 6 nucleons, each with their rest mass. But wait, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses minus the binding energy (mass defect). So for a nucleus, the exact mass is a bit less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons.

Wait, but in this problem, X is Li-6. So I should get the exact atomic mass.

Wait, Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.015122 amu.

So converting that to MeV:

6.015122 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu = ?

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015122 amu *931.5 MeV/amu = ?

0.015122 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute that:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315

0.005122 *931.5 = 4.760 MeV approximately.

Adding: 9.315 +4.760 =14.075 MeV.

Total: 5589 +14.075 = 5603.075 MeV =5.603075 GeV.

So that's correct. So E is 3.57142857 *5.603075 = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

5.603075 *3.57142857.

Let me think of 3.57142857 as 25/7, since 25/7 is approx 3.57142857.

Wait, 25/7 is 3.57142857...

So 5.603075 * (25/7) = ?

Multiplying 5.603075 by 25: 5.603075 *25 =140.076875.

Divide by 7: 140.076875 /7 ≈20.010982 GeV.

So that's about 20.011 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. Hmm. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the energy is calculated. Let me think: the energy required for each nucleus in the collider is the total energy, which includes rest mass. But the question is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC is a collider, so each ion is accelerated to a certain energy. But colliders typically refer to the kinetic energy, or the total energy?

Wait, I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy per particle. Or sometimes the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). Wait, I need to clarify.

Wait, in accelerators, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy. But sometimes, the total energy (gamma m c²) is used. So for example, in the case of the LHC, they say it's at 7 TeV per proton, which is the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). So perhaps in this problem, the energy is the total energy, including rest mass.

But in our calculation, we found E = gamma * m c² = 20.011 GeV. But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. So maybe I made an error in the mass calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the exact value of sqrt(0.0784). Let me check that again. 0.28 is exactly sqrt(0.0784), so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is different. Let me double-check the exact atomic mass.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.015122 amu. So that's correct.

Wait, let me compute 6.015122 *931.5 again.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015122 *931.5:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005122 *931.5 = ?

0.005 *931.5 =4.6575.

0.000122 *931.5 =0.1131.

So 4.6575 + 0.1131 =4.7706.

So 9.315 +4.7706 =14.0856 MeV.

Total: 5589 +14.0856 =5603.0856 MeV =5.6030856 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.6030856 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately:

3.57142857 *5.6030856.

Compute 3 *5.6030856 =16.8092568.

0.5 *5.6030856 =2.8015428.

0.07142857 *5.6030856 = ?

0.07 *5.6030856 =0.392215992.

0.00142857 *5.6030856 ≈0.008008 (since 5.6030856 *0.00142857 ≈0.008, since 5.6 *0.00142857 is about 0.008).

So 0.392215992 +0.008008 =0.400224.

Adding all components: 16.8092568 + 2.8015428 =19.6108 (approx).

19.6108 +0.400224 ≈20.011 GeV.

Hmm, that's still 20.011 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Maybe I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in terms of protons and neutrons, including their rest masses.

Wait, another approach: the nucleus is made up of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So the total rest mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons is:

3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) =?

3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 =2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is less than this sum due to binding energy. So the binding energy (mass defect) is 5633.511 MeV - (6.015122 amu *931.5 MeV/amu) ?

Wait, let me compute 6.015122 *931.5.

Wait, 6.015122*931.5 =5603.086 MeV.

So the mass defect is 5633.511 -5603.086 =30.425 MeV.

So the rest mass of the nucleus is 5603.086 MeV, which we have already considered.

So perhaps my initial calculation is correct, and the energy is around 20.01 GeV.

But in the options, the closest higher value is C) 20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, if the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, then Kinetic Energy (K) = (gamma -1)*m0 c².

In that case, let's compute that.

Gamma is 3.5714, so gamma -1 is 2.5714.

So K =2.5714 *5.6030856 GeV.

Compute that: 2 *5.6030856 =11.206171.

0.5714 *5.6030856 = let's compute:

0.5 *5.6030856 =2.8015428.

0.0714 *5.6030856 ≈0.400 (earlier calculation).

So 2.8015428 +0.400=3.2015428.

Total K:11.206171 +3.2015428=14.4077 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14.4 GeV. The options are 18.475, 20.132, etc. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy, so E =gamma m0 c². So 20.01 GeV.

But the options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Our calculation is 20.011 GeV, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma or the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass should be calculated differently. Let me think again: the mass of the nucleus can be approximated as the sum of the masses of the nucleons, but considering that protons and neutrons have slightly different masses.

Wait, but in that case, 3 protons and 3 neutrons would have a combined mass of (3 *938.272) + (3 *939.565) = 3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

But the nucleus's rest mass is 5603.085 MeV, as calculated earlier. So the mass is 5603.085 GeV? No, wait, 5603.085 MeV is 5.603085 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact gamma value. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's exact because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact atomic mass includes electrons. Wait, no, because the nucleus is Li-6, which for a neutral atom would have electrons, but in the case of a nucleus (like in a collider), perhaps it's the bare nucleus, so charge +3 (since Li has 3 protons).

Wait, but when considering the mass of the nucleus, electrons aren't included, right? Because the nucleus is only protons and neutrons plus the binding energy. So in that case, the mass is 6.015122 amu, which includes the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a single nucleon, which is about 938 MeV, and just uses 6 *938 MeV for the nucleus mass. Let me try that approach.

6 *938 MeV =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E =5.628 *3.57142857 GeV.

Compute that:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.628 *3.57142857 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.028 *3.57142857≈0.100 (exact: 0.028 *3.57142857=0.100).

So 2.14285714 +0.100=2.24285714.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.1 GeV.

Ah, that's about 20.1 GeV, matching option C) 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the mass of the nucleus as 6 *938 MeV, neglecting the exact atomic mass.

So using this approach, the energy is approximately 20.1 GeV, which is option C.

So why the discrepancy in the first approach? Because the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 amu, which results in 5.603 GeV, leading to E=20.01 GeV. But if the problem approximates the mass as 6 *938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV, then E=20.1 GeV, matching option C.

The options don't have 20.01 GeV, so perhaps the intended approach is to use the 6 *938 MeV approximation. So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required for a Li-6 nucleus to move at 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot m_0 \cdot c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, with a total mass number \( A = 6 \). Its atomic mass is approximately \( 6.015122 \, \text{amu} \). Converting this to energy using \( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
m_0 \cdot c^2 = 6.015122 \cdot 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5603.086 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603086 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma \cdot m_0 \cdot c^2 \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \cdot 5.603086 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \) is close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). However, if the problem approximates the rest mass of the nucleus as \( 6 \cdot 938 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV} \), the total energy becomes:
\[
E = 3.5714 \cdot 5.628 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.1 \, \text{GeV}
\]
This matches option C more closely.

### Conclusion
Given the approximations and the provided options, the energy of the RHIC is most consistent with option C.
