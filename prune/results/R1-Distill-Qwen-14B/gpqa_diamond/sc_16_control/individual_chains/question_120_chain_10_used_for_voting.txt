Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax p is inversely proportional to distance d. Like p = 1/d or something? Wait, no, I think the formula is p (in parsecs) equals 1 over d in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. So a larger parallax means it's closer.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that their actual distances are spread out uniformly, not clustered. So the number density of stars in space is uniform. So more stars are at larger distances, but spread out.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So as parallax changes, how does the number of stars in a given plx range change?

Let me think. The number of stars in a certain volume of space would be proportional to that volume. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So I should model this.

Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. But when we're considering a range of parallaxes, say from p to p + dp, that corresponds to a range of distances from 1/p to 1/(p+dp). Wait, maybe I should express it as a thin shell between p and p + dp.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of distance. If I have a small change in parallax dp, that corresponds to a change in distance dd. Since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = - d² dp. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases.

But for our purposes, maybe I can ignore the sign because we're dealing with ranges. So the change in distance between p and p+dp is approximately d^2 dp.

Wait, let me clarify. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. But since each shell is a thin shell, the volume is roughly the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume element is 4πd² dd.

But how does this relate to the parallax? Because p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So substituting, d² = 1/p², and dd = d² dp (from earlier). Wait, because dp is the change in parallax. Let me see, from p to p+dp, the distance goes from d to d - (d² dp), because dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp. So the thickness in distance is d² dp. But since we're considering a small dp, maybe we can treat the volume as 4π (d²) (d² dp) )? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the volume element is 4πd² dd. But dd is d² dp, because from p = 1/d → dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - (d²) dp.

So substituting, the volume element becomes 4 π d² * (-d² dp). The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with the magnitude, maybe we can ignore the sign and just consider the absolute value. So volume = 4 π (d²) (d² dp) ) → 4 π d^4 dp.

But since d = 1/p, substituting that in, d^4 = (1/p)^4 = 1/p^4. So the volume becomes 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. The number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform number density n (number per unit volume). So number N = n * volume = n * 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, so the number per unit parallax (dp) would be N/(dp) = 4 π n / p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per parsec of parallax) goes as 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with plx. So if plx is p, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number decreases as p increases, and increases as p decreases.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would fit.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's see again.

p = 1/d → d = 1/p.

The volume element in terms of p is the volume between p and p + dp. That volume is 4π d² dd, where dd corresponds to the change in d for a change dp in p.

Since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume element is 4 π ( (1/p)^2 ) ( (1/p²) dp ) ) → 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

Oh wait, that's the same as before. So the number of stars in the volume element is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number per unit parallax drops as 1/p^4.

So the correct option is A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). For a small change in parallax \( dp \), the corresponding change in distance \( dd \) is given by \( dp = -\frac{1}{d^2} dd \), or equivalently \( dd = -d^2 dp \). The negative sign indicates that as \( p \) increases, \( d \) decreases.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -d^2 dp \), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( p \) increases, following the relation \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
