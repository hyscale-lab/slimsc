Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx⁵. Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if N is proportional to 1/plx⁵, substituting plx with 1/d gives N ∝ d⁵. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance. But wait, they ask per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the differential, like the change in N per change in r (distance). Or perhaps they're asking about the density of stars as a function of distance.

I think I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how N relates to r. Let's break it down.

Given:
N ∝ 1/plx⁵
But plx = 1/d, so substituting:
N ∝ (d)^5 ⇒ N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

Wait, but the number of stars in a region of the sky probably depends on the volume, since stars are spread out. Volume in three dimensions is proportional to r^3. So if the number of stars increases with r^5, that feels a bit counterintuitive because normally, volume increases with r^3. But maybe this is a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (which happens at large distances), the number of stars increases. So N ∝ d^5, as plx is 1/d.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly. But wait, the question is per unit range of distance. Hmmm.

Wait maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The number of stars as a function of parallax is given. Since parallax is 1/d, perhaps I can express N in terms of d.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 → N ∝ d^5. So N increases with d^5. So for a given distance change (like moving a bit further away), the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, stars become less dense as you go further because the volume increases. But according to this, N increases. That suggests that the density isn't the issue; perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance, not the total number up to that distance.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, which would be a density. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The number of stars in a given direction (so same region of the sky) would depend on how much you can see. The more distant the stars, the fainter they appear, but the question gives a specific relation with parallax.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. Let's say the number density of stars is n(r). Then, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be n(r) * 4πr² dr. But here, the problem states that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, maybe not. Because the problem states "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N ∝ d^5.

But let's think about what N represents. If N is the number of stars in a region, then how does N relate to the volume? Well, if you have a fixed solid angle (like a specific region of the sky), then the number of stars would depend on the depth (distance) you can observe. So in that case, the number of stars in that region would be the integrated number along the line of sight.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states that N varies with 1/(plx)^5, so N = k / plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question asks, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh wait, wait. It's asking how the number changes per unit distance, so maybe it's about the derivative dN/dr.

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the change in N with distance is proportional to d^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4. So if the question is about the rate of change (like how many more stars you get per additional distance unit), then the answer would be proportional to r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as the number of stars per unit distance (number per parsec, say). So if N is the number of stars in a region at a distance r, then the number per unit distance would be N/(delta r). But that's not exactly what the question says. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of flux or density. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So N increases with the fifth power of distance.

But the question is about the change with distance. So if N = k d^5, then the derivative dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to d^4. So per unit distance, the number increases by 5k d^4. So the change (per unit distance) is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C, r^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of 'how does the number change with distance per unit range of distance', which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of stars per unit volume, which would be a density. Let's think about that.

The number density of stars (n) is N divided by the volume. Volume is 4/3 π r^3. But in this case, N is ∝ d^5. So n = N / (4/3 π r^3) = (k r^5) / r^3 = k r^2. So n ∝ r^2. But that's not one of the options for the change, but the options are about the number change.

Wait, but the question isn't about the number density; it's about the number of stars in the region varying with parallax. So perhaps the correct approach is N = k / plx^5 → N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power of the distance. But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So if the distance increases by dr, dN is 5k d^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5k d^4, meaning the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to r^4.

Alternatively, the problem could be interpreted as N being the number of stars per unit distance. That would be dN/dr, which is 5k d^4, so per unit r, the number increases as r^4.

So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(d\)), i.e., \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance (\(r\))". This implies the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\), i.e., \(\frac{dN}{dr}\). Taking the derivative of \(N \propto d^5\), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \(r^4\). Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.
