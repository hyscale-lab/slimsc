Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a glass block that's itself moving. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A, B, C, D. I remember from my classes that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Here, the medium (the glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I think I need to consider how this motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. Let me visualize this. Imagine the glass is sliding to the right (toward the observer) at speed v. The light beam inside the glass is moving to the right as well, but slower because it's in the glass. 

Wait, speed of light in glass is c/n, but in which frame? In the glass's rest frame, it's c/n. But we need to find the speed in the lab frame, where the glass is moving. So I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, the velocities here are in the same direction. So maybe I can use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the glass is moving at speed v, and the light's speed in the glass is u' = c/n in the glass's frame. So to find the speed u in the lab frame, I think the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²). But wait, wait. Because in special relativity, when you have velocities in the same direction, you add them like that. But wait, the speed of light in the glass is already slower, so does that matter?

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So the lab sees the light as moving at what speed? Let me plug in the numbers. u' is c/n. So u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c). So the denominator is (1 + v/(n c)).

Wait, but wait, I have to make sure about the units. Since c is given as 1, then the denominator is 1 + (v)/(n). So the equation becomes:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (v)/(n) )

Because c is 1, so 1/(n c) is 1/(n), and v/c² is v/(1) =v.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)). Since u' is c/n, that's (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

Substituting c=1, that becomes (1/n + v) / [ 1 + (v/(n c)) ) ].

But c is 1, so denominator is 1 + v/(n). Wait, but 1 + (v/(n c)) becomes 1 + v/(n * 1) = 1 + v/n.

So numerator is (1/n + v) and denominator (1 + v/n).

Hmm, let me factor out 1/n from the denominator. 1 + v/n = (n + v)/n. Similarly, the numerator is (1 + n v)/n.

So numerator: (1 + n v)/n; denominator: (n + v)/n. So when I divide them, the n's cancel. So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's what I got. So the speed of light relative to the lab is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

But wait, does that make sense dimensionally? Let's check. The units of velocity would be (v in velocity) but the numerator is (1 + n v): but n is dimensionless, so it's m/s (assuming v is in m/s). So the units are correct.

Wait, but what if v is a significant fraction of c? But in this problem, c is 1, so we're using natural units where c=1. So the calculation holds.

Alternatively, is there another way to think about this? Like, considering the motion of the glass and the light's velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, another approach: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, how fast is the light moving? Well, the glass is moving at v, and the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So the lab would see the light moving at v + (c/n) divided by some factor to account for relativity.

Wait, but that brings us back to the velocity addition formula. So I think the initial calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) in the rest frame of the medium, where \( n \) is the index of refraction and \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory, we must account for this motion using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( c = 1 \) (in natural units). Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot v}{1}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

And the numerator:

\[
\frac{1}{n} + v = \frac{1 + n v}{n}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the laboratory frame becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
