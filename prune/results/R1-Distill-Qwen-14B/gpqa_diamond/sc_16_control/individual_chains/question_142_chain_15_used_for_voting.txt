Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. 

Wait, the density matrix for a pure state is a projector, right? Like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of projectors. So this ρ seems to be a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ each with equal probability. Because each term is ½|0⟩⟨0| and ½|1⟩⟨1|, so the state is a classical mixture of the two basis states.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, I think when people talk about the geometry of density matrices, especially for single qubits, they often map them to points in 3D space using the Bloch sphere representation.

The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |θ, φ⟩, the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But wait, density matrices for mixed states are more complex. For a mixed state ρ, the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Specifically, the coordinates are (ρ_x, ρ_y, ρ_z), where:

ρ_x = Tr(σ_x ρ)
ρ_y = Tr(σ_y ρ)
ρ_z = Tr(σ_z ρ)

And σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. The vector (ρ_x, ρ_y, ρ_z) lies inside the Bloch sphere, with the radius equal to the purity of the state.

So, let's compute each of these for the given ρ.

First, let me write out ρ again:

ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2

Wait, wait. That's the same as (|0⟩⟨0|)/2 + (|1⟩⟨1|)/2. So each term is a pure state with 50% weight.

Alternatively, this is equivalent to the completely mixed state for a single qubit. I remember that the completely mixed state has the maximum possible distance from the origin in the Bloch sphere representation, right? Because for a mixed state, the vector would be (0,0,0) for the maximally mixed state? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, for a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (I)/2, right? Wait, wait, because for a single qubit, the identity matrix is 2x2, so (I)/2 is the maximally mixed state. Let me confirm.

The identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], which is the same as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So yes, the given ρ is the maximally mixed state.

The maximally mixed state is the center of the Bloch sphere because it has zero coherence and equal probability for all possible states. So its expectation values for the Pauli matrices should be zero.

Let me compute each component.

Compute ρ_x = Tr(σ_x ρ)
σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]
So σ_x ρ = [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by [[1/2, 0], [0,1/2]].

Wait, matrix multiplication: each element (i,j) is the sum over k of σ_x[i,k] * ρ[k,j].

So σ_x ρ = (0*1/2 +1*0, 0*0 +1*1/2) for row 1.
Wait, perhaps better to compute each element.

σ_x is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0 ],
  [0, 1/2 ] ]

Multiplying σ_x * ρ:

Element (1,1): 0*(1/2) + 1*0 = 0
Element (1,2): 0*0 + 1*(1/2) = 1/2
Element (2,1): 1*(1/2) + 0*0 = 1/2
Element (2,2): 1*0 + 0*(1/2) = 0

So σ_x ρ is:
[ [0, 1/2],
  [1/2, 0 ] ]

The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 = 0. So ρ_x = 0.

Similarly, compute ρ_y = Tr(σ_y ρ).
σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
So σ_y ρ:

Element (1,1): 0*(1/2) + (-i)*0 =0
Element (1,2):0*0 + (-i)*(1/2) = (-i)(1/2)
Element (2,1):i*(1/2) + 0*0 = i*(1/2)
Element (2,2):i*0 +0*(1/2)=0.

So σ_y ρ is:
[ [0, (-i/2)],
  [i/2, 0] ]

The trace is sum of diagonals, which is 0. So ρ_y = 0.

Now ρ_z = Tr(σ_z ρ).
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

σ_z * ρ:

Element (1,1):1*(1/2) + 0*0 = 1/2
Element (1,2):1*0 +0*(1/2)=0
Element (2,1):0*(1/2) + (-1)*0=0
Element (2,2):0*0 + (-1)*(1/2) = -1/2

So σ_z ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, -1/2] ]

The trace is (1/2) + (-1/2) = 0. So ρ_z is 0.

Wait, so all components are zero. That would make the point (0, 0, 0) in the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin. So the correct answer is option C, which lists r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options:

Option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the two basis states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \), each with a weight of \( \frac{1}{2} \). In the Bloch sphere representation, the coordinates of a density matrix are determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, given by:

\[
\rho_x = \text{Tr}(\sigma_x \rho), \quad \rho_y = \text{Tr}(\sigma_y \rho), \quad \rho_z = \text{Tr}(\sigma_z \rho),
\]

where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( \sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

1. **Calculating \( \rho_x \):**  
   \[
   \sigma_x \rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The trace is \( 0 + 0 = 0 \), so \( \rho_x = 0 \).

2. **Calculating \( \rho_y \):**  
   \[
   \sigma_y \rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\frac{i}{2} \\ \frac{i}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The trace is \( 0 + 0 = 0 \), so \( \rho_y = 0 \).

3. **Calculating \( \rho_z \):**  
   \[
   \sigma_z \rho = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The trace is \( \frac{1}{2} + (-\frac{1}{2}) = 0 \), so \( \rho_z = 0 \).

Thus, the coordinates of the density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation are \( (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This matches option **C**.
