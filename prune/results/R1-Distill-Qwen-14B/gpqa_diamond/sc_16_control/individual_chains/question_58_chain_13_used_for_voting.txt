Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization.

First, I should remember what regularization is. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math blow up. So you apply a regularization method to make these infinities manageable, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. 

The question is asking which theory never needs this. So, the theory that doesn't have these divergences, or doesn't require such techniques.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a quantum theory of gravity, and it's supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything. But wait, string theories have their own issues with divergences, right? Or... wait, maybe I'm confusing. Or perhaps because they're background-dependent, but I'm not too sure. But I think string theories actually don't require as much regularization because they have a different structure, maybe due to the higher-dimensional or stringy nature. But I'm not certain.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong force. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. Wait, I think when you calculate loop diagrams, especially at high energies or when the coupling becomes strong, you might get divergences. But wait, isn't QCD asymptotically free? So at high energies, the coupling is weak, which would make perturbation theory work. But do you still need regularization? Or maybe QCD can have problems with things like confinement. But regularization-wise, I think QCD does require it. Because when you calculate loops, you get divergent integrals that need to be regularized. So B probably requires it.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that in QED, you have processes like electron-positron pair production from photons, and when calculating loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. But the nice thing about QED is that renormalization works well. But wait, even with renormalization, you need to regularize first, right? So yes, QED requires regularization. So option C does require it.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait a minute. Classical theories don't involve quantum effects. So in classical electromagnetism, you don't have divergences in the same way because you're not dealing with things like virtual particles or loop corrections. So you don't need regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So classical ED doesn't require it.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if the theory is classical, then yes, because regularization is a quantum thing. So among the options, D is classical electrodynamics, which doesn't need it.

Wait, but the question specifies "physical theories"—so it's about which theory, in any context, doesn't require regularization. So, if the theory is classical, it doesn't have the divergences that come from quantum effects. But then, the other options are quantum theories. So the correct answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there any quantum theories that don't require regularization? Well, superstring theory—does it require regularization? I'm not entirely sure. Because string theory is a background-dependent theory, maybe it's formulated in a way that doesn't require the same type of regularization as QFT. But I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, maybe because string theory has a higher-dimensional framework, its perturbative expansions don't lead to the same type of divergences that require regularization. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps none of the quantum theories listed don't require regularization, so the only one that doesn't is the classical one, D. So the answer would be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

1. **Superstring Theory (A):** String theory is a quantum theory of gravity that incorporates higher-dimensional structures and is distinct from standard quantum field theory. While it addresses divergences in a unique way, it still involves quantum effects and may require regularization in certain formulations, though its structure reduces the need for it compared to other quantum theories.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (B):** QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, a non-abelian gauge theory. It deals with divergences in loop calculations, particularly at high energies, where the coupling becomes weak (asymptotic freedom). Regularization is necessary in QCD to handle these divergences, even though the theory is well-behaved perturbatively at high energies.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (C):** QED is the theory of electromagnetism and involves divergent loop integrals in quantum calculations. While renormalization resolves these divergences, regularization is a prerequisite for renormalization in QED.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (D):** This is a classical theory and does not involve quantum effects. Since regularization is a technique specific to quantum field theory, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

Among the options, only **Classical Electrodynamics (D)** does not involve quantum divergences and therefore never requires regularization.
