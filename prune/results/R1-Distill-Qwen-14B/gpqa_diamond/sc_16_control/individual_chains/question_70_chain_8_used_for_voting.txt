Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then breaking it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving several substances labeled A to H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll try to map out the reactions based on the information provided.

1. Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think the key here is to identify the possible compounds each letter represents. Let's go through them one by one.

Starting with Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Solid A reacting with gas B. The product is bright red. Hmm, bright red makes me think of something like sulfur or perhaps a transition metal compound. Wait, but if B is a gas, common gases are O2, Cl2, H2, maybe SO3? Let me think about the 8 equivalents. 8 is a high number, so maybe B is a diatomic gas. For example, O2 is a diatomic gas. If A is a metal reacting with O2, but wait, 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. That might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with a diatomic gas, but that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: the product C is used in subsequent reactions. Let's think about what C could be. When C reacts with water, it reforms A and two acids. One strong and one weak. So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitrate salt. Because nitrates are often involved in reactions with other substances. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate? Or perhaps it's a sulfide? Hmm.

Wait, if C reacts with water to produce two acids, maybe a strong and a weak. For example, if C is something like NaNO3, but that probably wouldn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like ammonium nitrate, but that might not fit.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of C with D. C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, maybe E is something like chlorine gas, but that's not extremely hazardous beyond what D could be. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN? Or perhaps a compound like phosgene? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's think about Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Wait, if D and B combine in 1:1, and H is a solvent, perhaps D is NH3 (ammonia), and B is HCl? Then H would be NH4Cl. But wait, ammonia is a gas at room temperature, but when combined with HCl gas, it forms NH4Cl which is a solid, not a solvent. Or perhaps B is H2O? But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if H is a solvent, maybe it's something like ethanol. Then, for D and B combining to make ethanol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. Wait, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. Let me think again.

Looking back at Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So 8 moles of B per mole of A. If B is O2, 8 O2 would be 16 O atoms. So A must be something with an oxidation state that needs 8 O2 molecules? Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with an oxidation state that requires 8 O atoms. For example, if A is Fe, but Fe typically forms FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Hmm, but 8 O2 would be 16 O atoms, so perhaps A is a metal that forms a compound with formula MO8? That's a bit unusual. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2. Then, 8 equivalents would be 8 mol Cl2 per mole of A. So if A is carbon, for example, C reacting with Cl2 in a combustion reaction? Wait, but carbon burning in Cl2 would form CCl4. But that's one mole of C reacting with two moles of Cl2. Hmm, not eight. So perhaps that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a chloride. For example, Na (solid) reacting with Cl2 gas. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 1 mole Cl2 per 2 moles Na. But that's 0.5 equivalents, which doesn't match the 8 in the problem. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about Reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

What salts hydrolyze to produce two acids? Hmm. Maybe a nitrate salt. For example, if C is ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NH4OH (which is a weak acid, but ammonia is a weak base, so perhaps NH4+ would form a weak acid) and HNO3, a strong acid. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe C is something like sodium sulfide, Na2S. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH (strong base) and H2S (weak acid). But that's base and acid, which doesn't fit F and G both being acids.

Wait another thought: maybe C is a sulfite salt. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and H2SO3. But H2SO3 is an acid, but NaOH is a base. Again, not two acids.

Alternatively, what about a carbonate? Maybe CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't do much. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate salt, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But nitrate itself in water can hydrolyze a little, but not produce a strong and a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. Or maybe a phosphate salt. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what E is. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. Perhaps E is something like hydrogen sulfide (but that's not extremely hazardous in the way the question implies). Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. But how would that form from C and D?

Wait, maybe D is Cl2. Let me think. If D is Cl2 and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form E.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece together the reactions.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). So D and B in 1:1 ratio. If H is a solvent, perhaps H is something like ethanol (C2H5OH), water (H2O), or maybe something else. Let's think about possible reactions.

If B is H2O, then D would have to be something that reacts with H2O in a 1:1 ratio. For example, D could be Cl2, but Cl2 reacts with water in a 1:1 ratio (but it's a diatomic molecule, so 1 mole Cl2 gives 2 moles HCl and HOCl). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, D could be NH3, but NH3 is a gas at room temp. If B is H2O, then NH3 + H2O → ...? Not sure.

Alternatively, if H is a solvent like ethanol, then D and B might be something like SO3 and H2O, but that's probably not right. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is something that reacts with O2 in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about H being a common solvent. For example, H could be ethanol. Then, D and B would combine to form ethanol. Possible options: Maybe D is H2O and B is ethylene (C2H4), but that's a stretch. Or perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about Reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that provides both a strong acid (like HNO3) and a weak acid (like H3PO4) upon hydrolysis. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitrate salt. For example, if A is sodium (Na), B is O2, and C is NaO2 (sodium peroxide). Then, when NaO2 reacts with water, it forms NaOH (strong base) and O2. But that's not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say A is Fe, B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas). So that's not fitting.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal reacting with a diatomic gas to form a compound C.

Wait, let me think about a reaction where a metal reacts with 8 equivalents of a gas. For example, consider the reaction of sodium (Na) with chlorine gas (Cl2). The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So, 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 2 moles of Na. But in the problem, 8 moles of B (gas) are used per mole of A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. That would mean 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 1 mole of Na, which would produce 2 moles of NaCl. Hmm, but 8 Cl2 would be 16 Cl atoms, so perhaps the product is NaCl2? No, sodium typically forms +1 ions, so that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, and B is O2. The reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 moles of O2 per 4 moles of Fe. So 0.75 equivalents, which doesn't match the 8 equivalents. So not that.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state. Let's say A is molybdenum (Mo), and B is O2. The reaction could form MoO4^2- or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, and A is a metal that forms a high chlorination product. For example, a metal reacting with excess Cl2. Let's say A is P (solid), and B is Cl2. The reaction is P + Cl2 → PCl5. But the stoichiometry is 1 P : 5 Cl2. So 5 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of P. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (S), and B is O2. The reaction could be S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But again, the stoichiometry doesn't fit 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and sulfur vapor. For example, Fe reacting with S vapor: Fe + S → FeS. But again, not sure about stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that B is a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. So if B is, say, Cl2, 8 moles would be 4 moles of Cl. So perhaps A is a metal that forms a chloride with Cl- in a 1:4 ratio. For example, something like PbCl2 (lead chloride). Wait, but PbCl2 is typically a 1:2 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a chlorate or something else. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product E. Since E is formed from C and D, and E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Or perhaps it's sarin or VX, but those are more related to organophosphates. Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas.

If E is phosgene, then what's C and D? Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a strong base, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form phosgene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like diphosphine or another compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about Reaction 4 again. D + B → H (solvent). If H is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Or H could be ethanol, which is a solvent. So D and B reacting to form ethanol. For example, D could be ethylene oxide (but that's a gas?), and B could be H2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl and B is NaOH, producing NaCl and water, but that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, maybe I should think about H being a common solvent like ethanol. So reaction 4 could be D (something) + B (something else) → ethanol. For example, maybe D is ethylene (C2H4) and B is H2O, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is SO3, but that would form H2SO4, a liquid, not a solvent in gas form.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach this differently.

Let's suppose:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
- C is a compound that upon reaction with water (Reaction 3) gives A back and two acids: F (strong) and G (weak)

So, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Let's say A is sodium (Na), B is O2. Then, C would be NaO2 (sodium peroxide). Wait, sodium peroxide is Na2O2, which is bright yellow, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, but sulfides are usually not bright red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a transition metal compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another metal oxide is red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish-brown, but perhaps not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur-based compound. Sulfur is bright yellow, but maybe in some compounds it's red.

Wait, perhaps C is CuO, but that's black. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a compound of manganese. Some manganese compounds are red. For example, potassium permanganate is dark purple, but perhaps in some form it's red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. But I'm not sure about their colors.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red color is a clue. One bright red solid I can think of is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, which is red. But I'm not sure about the reactions.

Wait, let me think about the hydrolysis reaction (Reaction 3): C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid.

If C is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, and it reacts with water, would that produce Hg, and perhaps some acids? Not really. Mercury oxide hydrolyzes to Hg and O2, I believe. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Let's say C is Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But I don't think that produces acids. Nitrate can hydrolyze a little, but not to produce a strong and a weak acid.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid (like HNO3) and a weak acid. Wait, but that's not how salts work. Salts are usually made from a strong acid and a weak base, or vice versa.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a weak base and a weak acid. When it hydrolyzes, it could produce both acids. For example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which is a salt of the weak acid HSO3^- and the strong base NaOH. Hydrolysis would produce HSO3^- (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the problem states that F and G are acids, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate salt. For example, NaHSO4. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+, HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid (stronger than water) and donate a proton to form H2SO4 (strong acid) and SO4^2- (weak acid). Wait, but that might not fit exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). But again, F and G are acids, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, benzene sulfonate. But I'm not sure how that would hydrolyze.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the acids F and G might be from the same element but different oxidation states. For example, if F is HNO3 (strong acid) and G is H3PO4 (weak acid), but I don't see a direct connection.

Alternatively, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). But how would that form from C?

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide salt. For example, if C is CuS, reacting with water might produce H2S (weak acid) and Cu(OH)2 (which would be a base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should take a different approach and think about possible compounds for E.

Since E is produced by C reacting with D in a 2:1 ratio, and E is extremely hazardous. Let's think about E possibilities.

What are some extremely hazardous compounds?

- Sarin gas (C4H8FPO3), a nerve agent.
- Phosgene (COCl2), a toxic gas.
- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), highly toxic.
- Mustard gas (C4H8S2), a vesicant.
- Ricin, a protein toxin, but that's not a compound formed from these reactions.
- VX, another nerve agent.

Hmm. If E is phosgene (COCl2), then perhaps it's formed from a reaction involving D and C. Let me think: Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a strong base, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN. To make HCN, you can react cyanide salts with acids. But in this case, C reacts with D (gas) to form E.

Wait, if D is Cl2 and C is some cyanide salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a chloride gas, but that's not extremely hazardous beyond being a irritant.

Wait, perhaps E is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), but that's not a gas and not extremely hazardous in the same way.

Alternatively, maybe E is H2O, but that's not hazardous.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about E's structure and symmetry.

The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

So, the possible symmetry groups correspond to certain types of molecules.

- C2: has a 2-fold rotational axis. Think of molecules like water (H2O) which has C2v symmetry, but perhaps in another form.
- D4h: a dihedral group with a 4-fold axis and horizontal mirror planes. Think of molecules like methane (which actually has Td symmetry, but maybe not), or perhaps something with a square planar structure.
- D∞h: an infinite symmetry group, like in a linear molecule with multiple identical atoms, such as O2, H2, etc.
- C2v: has a 2-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes. H2O has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find E's symmetry. So if I can figure out what E is, I can determine its symmetry group.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible E structures.

Wait, another thought: if C reacts with D to form E, and D is a diatomic gas, maybe E is a molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, but CO2 is a gas and not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if E is something like Cl2, but that's a diatomic with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but D∞h is the symmetry of diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, etc.

Wait, the options include D∞h and C2v. So if E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group would likely be D∞h.

But I'm not sure what E is. Another approach: perhaps E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple planes of symmetry. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry.

But I'm not certain. Let's try to think about the possible E structure.

Wait, considering that Reaction 4 is D + B → H (solvent), and H is a solvent, which is likely a liquid or a solution, not a gas.

If I can't figure out E, maybe I can think of another way. Let's think about what reaction produces a bright red product. One possibility is the formation of a chromium compound. For example, potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is orange-red, but not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitro compound, but I'm not sure about the color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but sulfides are typically not bright red unless it's a specific compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound of vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but maybe another form is red.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red product is a sulfur-based compound, but pure sulfur is yellow.

Wait, perhaps C is a cobalt compound. Cobalt(II) oxide is pink, but not bright red. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about the hydrolysis reaction again.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid.

If F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3 (also strong?), but that doesn't fit because G is a weak acid. Alternatively, F could be HCl (strong) and G H3PO4 (weak). But how would C produce these?

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate ester. For example, if C is something like trimethyl phosphate, which upon hydrolysis would produce H3PO3 (which is a weak acid) and methanol. But that doesn't fit F being a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro phosphate like POCl3. When POCl3 reacts with water, it produces H3PO4 (strong acid) and HCl (strong acid). Hmm, but both are strong acids. But the problem states F is strong and G is weak. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a chloro sulfite. For example, SOCl2. When SOCl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl (strong acid), SO2, and H2O. But that's more like decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Let's say C is CH3NO2 (nitro methane). Upon hydrolysis, it might produce HNO2 (weak acid) and CH4 (which isn't an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonamide. Upon hydrolysis, it might produce a sulfonic acid (strong acid) and an amine, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile. For example, CH3CN. Hydrolysis would produce CH3COOH (weak acid) and NH3 (weak base). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction of C with D to form E. If E is a diatomic molecule, then its symmetry would be D∞h. Alternatively, if E is something like O3 (ozone), which has C2 symmetry, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is a triatomic molecule like CO2, which is linear, but O=C=O has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is linear with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, earlier I thought E might be phosgene (COCl2), which is a triatomic molecule. COCl2 has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. Its point group is C2v. Because it has a mirror plane and a C2 axis. So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be C2v.

But wait, the options include C2v as option D. So if E is COCl2, then the answer would be D) C2v.

But wait, let's check: COCl2 has a structure where the central atom (C) is bonded to O (double bond) and two Cl atoms. The molecule is linear, but with two different substituents (O and Cl). So the symmetry group would be C2v. Because it has a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular axis (if any?), and vertical mirror planes. Alternatively, perhaps it's D2h or something else. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on point groups.

Wait, the point group for COCl2 is actually C2v. Let me recall: the molecule has a C2 axis (rotation by 180 degrees), and two vertical mirror planes containing the C-O bond and the C-Cl bonds. So yes, C2v symmetry.

So if E is phosgene (COCl2), then its point group is C2v, which is option D.

But how does this fit with the reactions?

So, let's reconstruct:

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red).

Assuming C is COCl2 (phosgene), which is actually a colorless gas, but the problem says bright red, so perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, maybe C is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But wait, in HCN, the molecule is linear, with the structure H-C≡N. So the point group is D∞h because it's linear with two different ends but with a center of symmetry?

Wait, no. For a linear molecule, the point group is D∞h only if there are no distinguishing features. But HCN has a hydrogen on one end and a cyano group on the other. So the symmetry would be C2v, because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane perpendicular to the molecular axis.

Wait, no, for HCN, the point group is actually C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (rotating 180 degrees swaps H and N), and two mirror planes: one containing the molecular axis (the C≡N bond) and another perpendicular to it. So HCN has C2v symmetry.

So if E is HCN, its point group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would E be formed? Let's see: C + D → E.

If E is HCN, then perhaps C is CN- and D is H+. But C is a product of Reaction 1. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt, and D is an acid.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 3: C reacting with water produces HCN and another acid. For example, if C is KCN, then water would hydrolyze it to HCN and KOH. But KOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if C is NaCN, hydrolysis would produce HCN and NaOH. Again, not acids.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try to think about the possible reactions again.

Let me make some educated guesses based on the information.

Assuming C is a salt that produces two acids upon hydrolysis, perhaps it's a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it produces 2 NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that's a base and an acid, not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO3Na (sodium methyl sulfonate), hydrolysis would produce HSO3H (which is a weak acid, H2SO3) and CH3OH (which is a weak acid, but more of an alcohol). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate ester. For example, if C is ROPO(OH)2, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: F and G are two different acids. One strong, one weak.

Possible pairs:

- HCl (strong) and H2S (weak)
- HNO3 (strong) and H3PO4 (weak)
- H2SO4 (strong) and H2CO3 (weak)
- HClO4 (strong) and H2S (weak)

But how would these form from C?

Alternatively, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is H2CO3. Then, C could be a carbonate sulfate, but that's more of a mineralogical compound.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Let me try to think about the possible E symmetry groups.

If E is a linear molecule, its point group is likely D∞h or C2v. If it's a triatomic linear molecule with two identical atoms, it would be D∞h. For example, CO2 is linear with O on both ends, so D∞h. But if the ends are different, like HCN, then the point group is C2v.

So if E is HCN, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D) C2v.

But earlier I thought E might be phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry. So regardless, the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Wait, but let me think about what E could be. If C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E, and E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is a nerve agent. For example, sarin (GB) has the structure (OP(O)(CH2CH2CH3)3). Its point group is C2 because it's chiral, but wait, sarin is actually a chiral molecule, so its point group is C1. But this is getting too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like phosgene or HCN, which have C2v symmetry.

Another thought: perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. O2 has D∞h symmetry, and Cl2 also has D∞h. But those aren't extremely hazardous in the way E is described. Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure, its point group is C2v. Ozone has a central O with double bonds to two other O atoms. So it's a bent structure with a C2 axis and a mirror plane, giving C2v symmetry.

So if E is O3, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But would O3 be produced from the given reactions? Let me see.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is O3, then perhaps D is O2 and C is some other oxygen compound. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O2, which has a C2v symmetry. H2O2 has two H atoms and two O atoms in a bent structure. Its point group is C2v.

But H2O2 isn't extremely hazardous, though it's a strong oxidizer.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like ClF3, but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Wait, another approach: the symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Which of these are possible for E?

If E is a diatomic molecule, symmetry would be D∞h. If it's a triatomic linear molecule, D∞h or C2v. If it's a bent triatomic, C2v.

So, for example, HCN is triatomic and has C2v. O3 is triatomic and has C2v. Phosgene is triatomic and has C2v. CO2 is linear and has D∞h.

So if E is a linear triatomic, it would have D∞h. If it's a bent triatomic, it would have C2v.

But I'm not entirely certain which one E is.

Wait, the problem states that E is extremely hazardous. Which of the options for E are extremely hazardous?

- O3 (ozone): toxic, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts.
- HCN: highly toxic, yes. So it's a possibility.
- Phosgene (COCl2): highly toxic, yes.
- Sarin: extremely hazardous, but point group is C1, which isn't in the options.

So if E is phosgene or HCN, both have C2v symmetry, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that phosgene is COCl2, which is a triatomic molecule with C2v. So the symmetry group would be C2v.

So, the answer would be D) C2v.

The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The exact identity of A, B, and C is not fully determined, but C is a compound that undergoes further reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is a highly toxic compound.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to produce these acids.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. This provides a clue about the nature of D and B.

### Key Observations:
- E is extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to compounds like phosgene (COCl₂), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or ozone (O₃).
- The molecular symmetry group of E is determined based on its structure:
  - **Phosgene (COCl₂)**: A triatomic molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. It has **C₂v** symmetry due to a C₂ axis and vertical mirror planes.
  - **Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN)**: A linear molecule with a central carbon atom bonded to hydrogen and nitrogen. It also has **C₂v** symmetry due to a C₂ axis and vertical mirror planes.
  - **Ozone (O₃)**: A bent triatomic molecule with a central oxygen atom bonded to two other oxygen atoms. It also has **C₂v** symmetry due to a C₂ axis and vertical mirror planes.
- The symmetry group **D∞h** corresponds to linear molecules with identical ends (e.g., O₂, Cl₂), which does not fit E based on its description as extremely hazardous.
- The symmetry group **C₂** corresponds to molecules like water (H₂O), which does not match the structure of E.
- The symmetry group **C₂v** matches the structure of E if it is a triatomic molecule like phosgene, hydrogen cyanide, or ozone.

### Conclusion:
Given the description of E as extremely hazardous and the analysis of its possible structures, E is most likely a triatomic molecule with **C₂v** symmetry. This corresponds to option **D**.
