Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the speed of light observed in that medium, but wait—no, actually, the speed of light in the medium depends on the medium's properties, not its velocity. Or does it?

Wait, no, that's the thing. In special relativity, speeds add differently. Normally, if you're in a train moving at speed v, and you see a light beam, it still moves at c relative to you. So the medium's motion doesn't change the speed of light as measured in that medium. But wait, in this case, the medium (glass) is moving relative to the lab frame. Does that affect the speed of light in the glass as seen from the lab?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But that's the speed in the medium's rest frame, right? So when the medium is moving, would the lab observer measure a different speed?

I think I need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Because the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame isn't just c/n plus the glass's velocity. Relativity says velocities don't add linearly.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. And the light is moving at speed u' in the glass's frame. So in the lab frame, the speed u is given by the relativistic addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

But wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n, right? Because in the glass, the speed is c/n. So u' is c/n.

So substituting into the formula: u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (c v)/(n c²) ) is v/(n c).

So denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c)

So u = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c ) ]

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: (c/n) + v = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing fractions: multiply numerator by reciprocal of denominator.

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancels. So:

u = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, that becomes [c(c + n v)] / (n c + v)

But wait, note that n c + v is the same as c n + v. So the denominator is same as numerator's (c + n v) multiplied by n? Wait, no. Hmm.

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator again.

Wait, the numerator is (c + n v) * c = c^2 + c n v.

The denominator is (n c + v) = v + n c = same as denominator.

So u = [c(c + n v)] / (n c + v )

Wait, that's c*(c + n v)/(n c + v ). Hmm.

Wait, but the denominator is n c + v. The numerator is c^2 + c n v.

Wait, can we factor out anything? Let me see:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c.

So u = c (c +n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, if I factor the denominator as (n c + v ), and the numerator as c(c +n v ), which is the same as c (n v + c ), which is the same as the denominator but with a factor of c. Wait, not exactly. Let me see.

Wait, denominator is (n c + v ). So u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm, but let me see if this can be simplified. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, the denominator is (n c + v ). The numerator is c*(n v + c ). So that's c*(v n + c )

So u = [ c (n v + c) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, wait a second. Let me write it as:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But (c +n v) is the same as (n v + c ), which is the same as (v (n) + c ), but the denominator is (n c + v ) = (v + n c ) = same as n c + v.

Hmm, so perhaps this can be written as [c (c +n v)]/(n c +v )

Wait, but if I factor the denominator:

n c + v = v + n c.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor a 'c' from the denominator: c (n + v/(c) )

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor a 'n' from denominator: n c + v = n (c + v/(n) )

Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options.

The options are:

A) (1 + n*v)/(n + v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n- v )

D) (1- n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but in the expression I have, u is [ c (c +n v) ]/(n c +v )

But in the problem statement, c is given as 1. So substituting c=1.

So u = (1*(1 + n v )) / (n*1 + v )

Which simplifies to (1 +n v ) / (n +v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass motion.

Wait, but when the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is what I just calculated. But the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but as observed from the lab, it's [ (c/n) + v ] / (1 + (c v)/(n c² )) )

Wait, but I think my initial calculation is correct.

So according to the calculation, the speed would be (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, wait, another approach. Let me think about the frame of the glass. In the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab's frame would see the light's speed as (c/n + v ) / ( 1 + (c v)/(n c^2) )

Which simplifies to [ (c +n v ) /n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) )

But since c=1, this becomes [ (1 +n v ) /n ] / [ (n +v )/(n) ) ].

Because 1 + v/(n c ) = (n + v )/(n ), since c=1.

So the division becomes [ (1+nv)/n ] * [n/(n +v ) ] = (1+nv )/(n +v )

Which is the same as option A.

So that's the correct answer. So the answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The light beam propagates through the glass, which has a refractive index \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (as given). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame. Substituting \( u' = 1/n \) (since \( c = 1 \)) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{(1/n) v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression for \( u \) becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the numerator and denominator cancels:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]
