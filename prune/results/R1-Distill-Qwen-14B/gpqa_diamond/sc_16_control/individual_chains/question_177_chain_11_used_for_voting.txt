Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. Hmm.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember from the Rayleigh Jeans law or Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because Wien's displacement law says lambda_max * T = constant. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. I think that's correct. Because if the peak wavelengths are the same, they must have the same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Now, luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So since both stars have the same temperature, but different radii, their luminosities will depend on the square of their radii times T^4. Since the T is the same, L is proportional to R².

Wait, but wait again. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So substituting into the luminosity equation, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T^4 = (2.25) * 4π R2² σ T^4. And L2 is 4π R2² σ T^4. So L1/L2 is (2.25) * (L2)/(L2) )= 2.25. So the luminosity ratio is 2.25. So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

But wait, the question mentions that the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Hmm, but how does that affect luminosity? Because luminosity as computed by blackbody radiation depends only on radius and temperature. Unless the radial velocity affects the observed brightness through Doppler shift or something else?

Wait, but in this problem, the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars are blackbodies. So the fact that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s must not affect the intrinsic luminosity. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, whereas radial velocity affects observed quantities like brightness. Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed brightness could change due to Doppler boosting or something. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming they're black bodies. So perhaps the radial velocities are given to throw us off, or maybe they are part of the calculations somehow.

Wait another thought: Maybe the radial velocity affects the observed temperature because of the Doppler effect? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the light we receive is Doppler shifted. Oh right! The Doppler effect would change the observed wavelength, but in the problem statement, the peak wavelengths were found to be the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift introduced by the radial velocity is somehow accounted for, but in our case, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed, so maybe the velocities affect the temperature.

Wait, let's think. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so the observed wavelength is shorter. Conversely, if moving away, redshifted. But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So let's say Star_1 has velocity 0, so no shift. Star_2 has radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume that velocity is non-relativistic because 700 km/s is about 0.0023c, which is small. So maybe we can approximate the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ' = λ (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards. Wait, or is it (1 - v/c) for approaching? Let me think: if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), where β is v/c. But for non-relativistic speeds, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - v/c). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Wait, but in the problem, both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So their rest wavelengths must have been adjusted by their respective velocities.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: no velocity, so observed wavelength λ1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2: velocity v = 700 km/s, so observed λ2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c) or something like that.

Wait another approach: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So,

λ1_rest * (1 + v1/c) = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so v1 is 0. Star_2 has v2 =700 km/s, but we don't know if it's moving towards or away. Wait, radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. But in astronomy, the radial velocity is usually given as a positive number regardless of direction, but sometimes the sign matters. But the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700, but we don't know direction. Oh wait, the problem says 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. So perhaps Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

But regardless, the key is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest (1 + v1/c) = λ1_rest (since v1=0) = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 + v2/c). But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v2/c).

But wait, from Wien's law, lambda_max * T = b (a constant). So T = b / lambda_max.

If the observed lambda_max is the same, but the rest lambda_max is different because of Doppler shift, then the actual temperatures of the stars would be different.

Wait, so Star_1's rest frame: T1 = b / λ1_rest.

Star_2's rest frame: T2 = b / λ2_rest.

But because of the Doppler shift, the observed lambda_max is the same, so λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v2/c).

Wait, perhaps substituting.

Alternatively, since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, which is the same for both. Let's call this observed wavelength lambda. Then,

lambda = λ1_rest (1 + 0) = λ1_rest.

And lambda = λ2_rest (1 + v2/c).

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v2/c).

But according to Wien's law, lambda1_rest = b / T1.

lambda2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v2/c) )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c)

So,

T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c )

But wait, v2 is Star_2's radial velocity. Let me substitute v2 as 700 km/s. Wait, but I need to convert that to a fraction of the speed of light, c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v2 = 700 km/s is about 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...c.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333 + ... ) approximately. Using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

So T1 ≈ T2 (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

Hmm, but wait, that would make T1 slightly less than T2. But earlier, when I thought the temperatures were the same, I assumed that the observed lambda_max is the same, but that's only if their rest temperatures are the same. But now, considering the Doppler shift, the rest temperatures are different.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. So when computing L, would they use the observed temperature or the rest temperature?

Ah, that's a key point. So if the star is moving, the observed temperature would be different. Because the observed wavelengths are shifted, which affects the calculated temperature.

Wait, but how does this affect the calculation of luminosity?

In the problem, the astronomers are treating the stars as blackbodies and have computed the luminosities based on their observed properties.

So, for each star, they would measure the peak wavelength, use Wien's law to get the temperature, and then compute the luminosity using R and T.

So let me model this.

For Star_1: observed lambda_max is lambda. So using Wien's law, T1_observed = b / lambda.

For Star_2: observed lambda_max is the same lambda. But Star_2 is moving, so its rest lambda_max is different.

Wait, no. Because the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars, but the rest lambda_max and thus the rest temperatures are different.

So the observed lambda for both is lambda.

So T1 as observed is b / lambda.

T2 as observed is b / lambda.

But wait, that can't be right because Star_2 is moving, so its rest temperature is different.

Wait, perhaps the observed wavelength is lambda, so the observed temperature for each star would be the same. But in reality, their rest temperatures are different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me think again. The observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. So the observed temperature would be the same for both? Because T = b / lambda_obs. So if lambda_obs is same, then T_obs is same for both.

But that can't be, because if Star_2 is moving, its rest temperature would be different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think: each star emits a blackbody spectrum. Due to their velocities, the observed spectrum is Doppler shifted.

The observed peak wavelength for Star_2 is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), assuming it's moving away. Because if moving away, the wavelength is stretched (redshifted), so lambda_obs is longer. Wait, but the problem states that lambda_obs is the same as Star_1. So if Star_1 has v=0, then lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c).

But according to the problem, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda.

So,

lambda = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c)

But lambda_rest2 = lambda / (1 + v/c )

So, in the rest frame of Star_2, lambda_rest2 = lambda / (1 + v/c )

But the actual rest temperature of Star_2 is T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

So substituting,

T2 = b / (lambda / (1 + v/c )) ) = (b (1 + v/c )) / lambda.

But for Star_1, T1 = b / lambda_obs1 = b / lambda.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Ah, so the rest temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1.

Wait, because if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which would make it appear cooler (since lambda_max is larger, T is lower). But wait, in this case, the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same, so Star_2's rest frame must have a shorter lambda_max (and thus higher T) because it's moving away, which would make the observed lambda longer. But the observed is same, so Star_2 must have higher T.

Wait, let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda_max is longer than its rest frame. So, for observed lambda_max to be same as Star_1's (which is at rest), Star_2 must have a shorter rest lambda_max. Which implies higher temperature.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ) ≈ T1 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

But wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. So for each star, they would compute L as 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4, but using the observed T.

Wait, no. Because the observed T would be the same for both stars, since lambda_obs is same. So T1_obs = T2_obs.

But in reality, T1_rest = T1, and T2_rest = T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ) ≈ 1.002333 T1.

So when computing luminosity, would the astronomers use the observed T or the rest T?

Wait, the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So probably, the astronomers used the observed T, because that's what they measure. Because when you look at the spectrum, you observe the peak wavelength, which gives you T_obs. So if both have same observed T, but different R, then L is proportional to R^2. So the initial approach I thought would apply.

But wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving, the observed T is T_obs = T2_rest * (1 + v/c )^{-1} ?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me use the exact formulas.

The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And z = v/c for small velocities.

So for Star_2: lambda_obs = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c ). But since lambda_obs is same as Star_1, lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs/(1 + v/c ) = lambda_rest1/(1 + v/c )

Because Star_1 has no velocity, so lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / (1 + v/c )

Wien's law: lambda_rest = b / T_rest.

Thus, lambda_rest2 = b / T2_rest.

Similarly, lambda_rest1 = b / T1_rest.

So,

b / T2_rest = (b / T1_rest ) / (1 + v/c )

Cancel b,

1/T2_rest = (1/T1_rest) / (1 + v/c )

Multiply both sides by T2_rest * (1 + v/c ) * T1_rest,

T1_rest = T2_rest / (1 + v/c )

So,

T2_rest = T1_rest * (1 + v/c )

So Star_2's rest temperature is higher than Star_1's.

But when the astronomers compute the luminosity, which T do they use? The observed T or the rest T?

The problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming the stars are blackbodies. So the observed T would be used, because that's what's measured. Because when you observe the spectrum, you determine the peak wavelength, then calculate T_obs.

Wait, so for each star, T_obs = b / lambda_obs.

Since lambda_obs is same, T_obs is same for both. So when computing L, they use T_obs for each star.

So L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T_obs^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T_obs^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2)/(R2^2) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But wait, that's the initial approach. But earlier when considering Doppler shift, I thought that T_obs would be same, but the rest T would differ. So the luminosity depends on the actual T_rest, not T_obs.

Wait, no. Because the problem says the luminosity is computed based on the observed properties. So the assumption is that the observed T is same for both, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But wait, the problem says that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which would affect the observed brightness. Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. Observed flux would be affected by distance and Doppler factors, but the problem says that the luminosity is computed assuming blackbody, so perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't directly influence the luminosity calculation, as the observed flux might be adjusted to account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the steps again.

1. Both stars observed to have same peak wavelength (lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda).

2. So, using Wien's law, T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T, because lambda is same.

3. For each star, the astronomers compute their luminosity as L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, for Star_1, L1 = 4 pi (1.5 R2)^2 sigma T^4.

For Star_2, L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T^4.

Thus, L1/L2 = (2.25 R2^2) / R2^2 = 2.25.

So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But earlier I thought the radial velocity would affect the rest temperature, but since the luminosity is computed using the observed T, which is same for both, the ratio is simply (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is the radial velocity given then? Because if the problem didn't involve it, then it's just extra information. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: The calculation of luminosity might involve the star's rest frame. So if the star is moving, the observed flux is affected by the Doppler effect. But the problem says that luminosity is computed assuming blackbody. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the luminosity is calculated using the star's rest frame. So if Star_2 is moving, the observed flux would be different. But the problem says they computed the luminosities, so perhaps the calculation accounts for the Doppler shift.

Wait, but how would that affect the luminosity?

Wait, luminosity is intrinsic, so the observed flux F is related to L and distance. But in this problem, the distance isn't given, so perhaps it's not relevant.

Alternatively, when calculating the luminosity from observed quantities, the Doppler effect may affect the observed flux. So the observed flux F is F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + z), where z is the redshift, but I'm not sure about the exact relation.

Wait, no, the Doppler effect affects the observed flux. For a source moving towards us, the flux increases due to the Doppler boosting. The formula is F_obs = F_rest ( (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ) ). But for non-relativistic speeds, the sqrt term is approximately 1, so F_obs ≈ F_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, but in this problem, the luminosity is the intrinsic property, so the observed flux would be F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + v/c )^{-1} if moving away. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that the luminosities were computed assuming the stars are blackbodies. So perhaps they used the observed fluxes and adjusted for Doppler effects to find the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosities based on the observed properties. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

If the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, then using Wien's law, the observed temperatures are the same. So the ratio of the luminosities would depend on the ratio of R^2, which is (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But the given options are A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23, etc. So option A is 2.25.

But another thought: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, which the astronomers would use to compute luminosity. Wait, but luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so perhaps the computed luminosity would be the same as before, because the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the intrinsic L is R²T⁴.

Wait, I think the key here is that the observed peak wavelengths are same, so the observed temperatures are same, and so when computing luminosities, both would have same T_obs. Thus, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, so the answer is A.

But wait, the radial velocity is given, so perhaps the problem expects us to include it in the calculation. Maybe I'm supposed to account for the Doppler effect on the observed temperature, which would change how the luminosity is calculated.

Let me try that approach.

For Star_2, the observed temperature is T_obs = T_rest2 * (1 + v/c )^{-1}, assuming v is positive when moving away.

Wait no, earlier when I considered that, I found that T_rest2 = T_obs * (1 +v/c )

So T_obs = T_rest2 / (1 +v/c )

But if the astronomers are using the observed T (same for both stars) to compute the luminosity, which would be based on the same T, so again, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But perhaps the astronomers are using the rest T, which would be different.

Wait, but the problem says the luminosities were computed assuming the stars are blackbodies. So they would calculate luminosity based on the observed T and observed R. Or, no, the observed R?

Wait, no, R is measured via other methods, like angular size and distance. So the radius R is the actual radius, not affected by Doppler shift. Because even if the star is moving, its actual size doesn't change. So when computing L, R is R_rest, and T is T_rest.

Wait, but then how would the Doppler shift affect the calculation? Because the observed T would be different from the actual T_rest.

So if the observed T is same for both stars, but their actual T_rest is different because of Doppler shift, then the computed L would be different.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If the astronomers are using the observed T (from the peak wavelength) to compute the luminosity, then for each star, L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_obs^4.

But since R is the actual radius (not affected by Doppler), and T_obs is the same for both, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. So answer A.

But if they are using the true T_rest, which is different for each star, then:

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1_rest^4

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2_rest^4

But T2_rest = T1_rest * (1 +v/c )

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) * (T1_rest^4) / (R2^2 T2_rest^4 )

= (2.25) * ( T1_rest^4 / (T1_rest^4 (1 + v/c )^4 ) )

= 2.25 / (1 + v/c )^4.

So,

v =700 km/s. c=3e5 km/s. v/c=700/3e5 = 0.0023333.

So (1 +v/c )^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.002333 + ... ≈ 1.009333.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009333 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, now I'm getting a different result because I'm considering the actual T_rest for each star.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so the astronomers would use the observed T, not the rest T. So which approach is correct?

The question says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, they computed the luminosities based on their observed properties (wavelengths and sizes). So they would use T_obs, which is same for both.

Thus, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So answer is A.

But why is the radial velocity given? It must be part of the calculation somehow. Maybe because the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift, which changes the observed L.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to account for the fact that when a star is moving, the observed flux is different, which affects the luminosity calculation.

Wait, the luminosity is an intrinsic property. The observed flux F is related to luminosity by F = L / (4 pi d^2). But if the star is moving, the observed flux can be affected by Doppler shifting.

The formula for flux considering Doppler effect is F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v/c)^2 / (1 - v^2/c^2 )^0.5.

But for non-relativistic speeds, v << c, so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1, so F_obs ≈ F_rest (1 + v/c )^2.

But F_rest is L/(4 pi d^2), so F_obs ≈ (L/(4 pi d^2)) (1 +v/c )^2.

But without knowing the distance, I can't relate F_obs to L.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor, so perhaps they have considered the Doppler shift when calculating the luminosity.

Wait, wait. Let's think about this.

The flux F_obs is proportional to L (1 + v/c )² /4 pi d².

But without knowing d, I can't relate F_obs to L. But perhaps the problem is assuming that the Doppler effect is already accounted for in the observed flux, so when they compute the luminosity, they have to adjust for the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is F_obs = F_emitted * (1 + v/c ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v/c )^2, and since F = L / (4 pi d^2 ), but without knowing d, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the observed flux is F_obs = F_rest (1 + v/c )^2, where F_rest is the flux at rest. So the observed flux would be higher if the star is moving towards us.

But again, without knowing the distance, I can't directly relate F_obs to L.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effect on the observed flux due to Doppler shift. For example, if a star is moving towards us, it emits more flux because of the blueshift.

But in the problem, the radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1, and 700 km/s for Star_2. Assuming Star_2 is moving away.

So, Star_2's observed flux F_obs2 = F_rest2 * (1 + v2/c )^2.

Star_1's F_obs1 = F_rest1.

But since F = L / (4 pi d^2 ), and if both stars are at the same distance, then L1 = F_obs1 * 4 pi d^2.

L2 = F_obs2 * 4 pi d^2.

So,

L1/L2 = (F_obs1) / (F_obs2 )

But F_obs2 = F_rest2 * (1 + v2/c )^2.

But F_rest2 = L2/(4 pi d^2 )

So,

F_obs2 = (L2/(4 pi d^2 )) * (1 + v2/c )^2.

Similarly, F_obs1 = L1/(4 pi d^2 )

So,

L1/L2 = [ (L1/(4 pi d^2 )) ] / [ (L2/(4 pi d^2 )) (1 + v2/c )^2 ) ] 

= ( L1 / L2 ) / (1 + v2/c )^2.

But from earlier, when not considering Doppler, L1/L2 is 2.25.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 * L2/L2 ) / (1 + v2/c )^2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c )^2.

But wait, that's a bit of a loop.

Wait, perhaps I should express L1 and L2 in terms of their rest fluxes.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, which in turn affects the calculation of luminosity. So if we assume that the observed fluxes are the same, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about the observed flux. It only says that the peak wavelengths are same, and the radial velocities are given.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure whether the Doppler shift affects the calculated luminosity. The problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming blackbody radiation. So I think the correct approach is to use the observed T (same for both) and the actual R to compute L.

So, since R1 is 1.5 R2, and T_obs is same, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So answer is A.

But why is the radial velocity given? Because if the observed T is same, then it's same as using the observed data. But perhaps the radial velocity is a red herring, or perhaps it's a clue that the observed T is same, but the real T is different, which affects the luminosity.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The problem says: "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, the computed L is based on the observed properties.

So, if the observed T is same for both, then L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

Thus, the answer is A.

But earlier when I considered the rest T, I found a factor of about 2.23, which is option D.

But that would be the case only if the astronomers used the rest T, which would be different due to Doppler shift.

But the problem says they computed luminosity based on observed properties, so they would use observed T, which is same.

Thus, I think the correct answer is A) ~2.25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their observed properties. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, implying the same observed temperature. The radial velocity of Star_2 is given as 700 km/s, but this does not directly affect the calculation of intrinsic luminosity, which depends on the radius and temperature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Observed Temperature and Wavelength**:  
   Since the observed peak wavelengths of both stars are the same, their observed temperatures are identical. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), the observed temperature \( T_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   Since the observed temperature \( T_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of their luminosities depends only on the ratio of their radii squared:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2
   \]

3. **Radius Ratio**:  
   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)). Substituting this into the luminosity ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]

4. **Radial Velocity Consideration**:  
   The radial velocity of Star_2 (700 km/s) could affect its rest temperature due to Doppler shifts. However, the problem specifies that the luminosities are computed based on observed properties, meaning the observed temperature \( T_{\text{obs}} \) is used. Thus, the rest temperature difference caused by the radial velocity does not influence the calculated luminosity ratio.

5. **Final Ratio**:  
   Based on the observed temperature and radius ratio, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A) ~2.25**, as the observed temperature is the same for both stars, and the luminosity ratio depends solely on the radius ratio squared.
