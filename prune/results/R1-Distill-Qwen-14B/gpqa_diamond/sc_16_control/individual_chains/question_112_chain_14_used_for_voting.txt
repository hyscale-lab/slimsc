Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about an electron's state and some measurements. Let me try to break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I need to normalize this state because when dealing with quantum states, they must have a norm of 1. 

Wait, the question says it's proportional, so maybe I should normalize it first. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let's compute the coefficients: (1+i) and (2-i).

The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly for (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state would be [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

But wait, the state is already given as proportional. So when calculating probabilities, I can just compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients divided by the sum of squares. So the probabilities for |up> and |down> would be 2/7 and 5/7, respectively. Because 2 +5=7.

Wait, let me compute that again. (1+i) has a magnitude squared of (1)^2 + (1)^2 =2. Similarly, (2-i) has (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5. So yes, 2 and 5. So the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7. That's about 0.2857 and 0.7143. Wait, but the options don't seem to have these numbers directly. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which are close to 2/7 (~0.2857) and 5/7 (~0.7143). So maybe that's part of the answer.

But wait, the question isn't only about measuring the spin in the z-direction. Oh, right, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write that matrix. Since it's a 2x2, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

This is the matrix of the operator. Hmm, what's the significance of this matrix? It looks like it's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, yes, because the Pauli matrices are defined as sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the superpositions |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x flips the spin in the x-direction.

So when the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, it's asking for the probability of getting +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 when measuring A.

But to find these probabilities, we need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, the state |alpha> is already in the z-basis. So perhaps we can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in the state |alpha>.

Let me think about how to approach the measurement probabilities.

First, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but normalized. So I need to normalize first.

Compute the normalization factor. The magnitude squared is |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2 = (1^2 +1^2) + (2^2 +1^2) )= 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, to express this state in terms of |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of these.

Let me denote |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

So, substituting:

a |+x> + b |−x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [a + b]/sqrt(2) |up> + [a − b]/sqrt(2) |down>.

Set this equal to |alpha>, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So,

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( a − b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 − i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

1. (a + b) = (1 + i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2. (a - b) = (2 - i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Now, I can solve for a and b.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [3 ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (1−2) + (i +i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (-1) + 2i ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|²:

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )
The magnitude squared is [ (3 sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ] = (9 *2 ) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. Hmm, looking at the options:

Option A has 0.64, which is close to 9/14. Let's check 9/14 is 0.642857, so 0.64 is close.

Now, compute |b|²:

b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The numerator's magnitude squared is | (-1 + 2i ) |² = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5.

So |b|² = (5) * (2) ) / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ] * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7))²? Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, b is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

So the magnitude squared is | (-1 + 2i ) |^2 * ( sqrt(2) )^2 / (2 sqrt(7))^2.

Which is (5) * (2) / (4 *7) )= 10 /28 = 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that makes sense.

So the probabilities of measuring +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 are 9/14 (≈0.6429) and 5/14 (≈0.3571) respectively. So in terms of the options, let's see.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

Hmm, 0.64 is 9/14≈0.6429, and 0.36 is 5/14≈0.357. But wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, so 0.36 is close. Also, the probabilities sum to 1, so that's correct.

But let's check the average value part.

The average value of the operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

The state |alpha> is in the z-basis, so perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> as <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

Compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * sigma_x * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, sigma_x as a matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply sigma_x with the state vector (which is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T), we get [ (2−i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then the bra is [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2−i)/sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (1+i)/sqrt(7)

Multiply each term:

First term: (1-i)(2−i) /7
= [ (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i*2) + (-i)(-i) ] /7
= [ 2 -i -2i + i^2 ] /7
i^2 is -1, so:
= [ 2 -3i -1 ] /7 
= (1 -3i)/7.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) /7
= [2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i ] /7
= [2 + 2i +i +i^2 ] /7
= [2 +3i -1 ] /7 
= (1 +3i)/7.

Add the two terms:

(1 -3i + 1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says average is hbar/7, which matches this result.

Wait, but earlier, the probabilities I calculated were 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So the options with 0.64 and 0.36 (which is a sum of 1.00) are option A. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are 0.6429 and 0.3571.

But option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close enough. So the average is hbar/7, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me recalculate the probabilities.

Wait, my initial approach was to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and the coefficients' squared norms give the probabilities. But perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, when I solved for a and b, I had:

a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7))
b = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

So |a|² is (3^2 * 2) / (4 *7) )= (9*2)/(28) )= 18/28=9/14≈0.6429.

|b|² is | (-1 +2i ) |² * (2) / (4 *7) )= (5 *2) / (28) )=10/28=5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So the options need to have these values.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64 and 0.36. 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is approx 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A matches the probabilities and the average.

Wait, but option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which are 2/7 and 5/7, but these are the probabilities in the z-basis, not the A operator's eigenbasis. So option C is not the correct one.

So according to this, the correct answer should be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar / sqrt(7)

The average would have to be hbar/7 as I calculated. 3hbar/sqrt(7) is about 3 * 1.2247 ≈3.674, but hbar/7 is about 0.1428 hbar. So option B's average doesn't match.

Option C: 0.28 (2/7), 0.72 (5/7), average hbar/sqrt(7)= approx  0.37796 hbar. Wait, but our average is hbar/7, which is about 0.1428 hbar, so that's different.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7). The average is 2hbar/sqrt(7), but we have hbar/7. So not matching.

So the only option that matches the average value of hbar/7 and the probabilities of approximately 0.64 and 0.36 is option A.

The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5

The total squared norm is 2 + 5 = 7. Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩
\]

### Step 2: Probabilities in the eigenbasis of A
The operator A has matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩)
\]

Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = a |+x⟩ + b |-x⟩
\]
Substitute \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \):
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩) + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩)
\]
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} |up⟩ + \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}} |down⟩
\]
Equate coefficients:
\[
\frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

Solve for \( a \) and \( b \):
1. \( a + b = \frac{(1+i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}} \)
2. \( a - b = \frac{(2-i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}} \)

Add and subtract the equations:
\[
2a = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}, \quad 2b = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \):
\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{18}{28} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429
\]
\[
|b|^2 = \left(\frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{10}{28} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

### Step 3: Average value of A
The average value of \( A \) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle
\]
Using \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), compute \( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \):
\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{(2+i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}}
\]
\[
= \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7}
\]
\[
= \frac{(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is \( \hbar/7 \). These match **Option A**.

Answer: A
