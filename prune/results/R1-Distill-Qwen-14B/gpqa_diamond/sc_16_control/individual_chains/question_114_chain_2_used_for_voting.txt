Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. So the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through nucleophilic addition. So for the first part, butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (like NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think the first step in such a reaction is adding a cyanide to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but then what's reagent A? Because I think that after adding the cyanide, you might need an acid to protonate or something. Oh right, when you add a nucleophile like CN- to a ketone, you get an addition product, which is a cyanohydrin. But I think the reaction actually is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So for that, the conditions are usually acidic. So reagent A must supply the H+ ions. Like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, for example) or something else that can protonate.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ because the reaction needs to be under acidic conditions. Because when you have a ketone reacting with NaCN, it's typically done in a solution where the cyanide is the nucleophile and the conditions are acidic, maybe. Wait, wait. No, wait. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a solution, if you have a ketone and add NaCN, the CN- will attack the carbonyl, forming the cyanohydrin. But then why is the product a nitrile group?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Another possibility is that the reaction is an enamine formation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and adding NaCN in presence of something else could lead to a nitrile.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- to it, you get (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh, that makes sense. So the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol with a nitrile group.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Okay, so the reaction conditions for that. I think the cyanide is added to the carbonyl, and then the workup is done in acidic conditions, or maybe it's done under basic conditions. Wait, no, the addition of CN- to the ketone would proceed under basic conditions, but wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the nucleophilic addition of CN- to a ketone. The ketone is a good electrophile. So CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the oxygen becomes O-, which needs to get protonated. So if the solution is acidic, the O- is protonated to form OH, which then leaves as H2O, but wait, no, because the product is a cyanohydrin. So perhaps the conditions are such that the solution is acidic to protonate the O- intermediate.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done under basic conditions, but let me think. Wait, when you add NaCN to a ketone, you typically need a base because the solution is made basic. Wait, but if you have NaCN, which is a source of CN-, but maybe it's in a solution that's made basic with something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, but the product is a cyanohydrin, which is the addition product. So the reaction is probably done under acidic conditions. Because in acidic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack. After the attack, the O- would get protonated, leading to the formation of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- in solution. So if the solution is acidic, say with H3O+, then the CN- would be deprotonated? Because in solution, H3O+ would donate a proton to CN- if it can, but wait, CN- is a weak base. Hmm, maybe the conditions are such that the solution is acidic, so that after the addition, the O- is protonated.

Wait, perhaps in the first step, the reaction is done under basic conditions, but no, the reagent A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let me look at the options.

The options are A, B, C, D. The first reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The second reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. The product is a cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. How is this done?

I think that the reaction of ketones with NaCN under acidic conditions produces the cyanohydrin. Because under acidic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, resulting in the tetrahedral intermediate. The leaving group (water) would then depart, but wait, in this case, the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So perhaps in the workup, it's acid-catalyzed.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is done in a basic solution, but then I'm not sure why A would be H3O+.

Wait, another approach: the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, forming the tetrahedral intermediate. Then, to get rid of the leaving group (like hydroxide), you need to protonate it. So in acidic conditions, the O- would pick up a proton to become OH, which then leaves as H2O, but wait, that would form a nitrile, right?

Wait, but the product is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl, leading to the tetrahedral intermediate, and then under acidic conditions, the O- picks up a proton, making OH, and then the water leaves, leading to the nitrile.

Wait, but in that case, the product would have the nitrile where the carbonyl was, and the hydroxyl comes from the other side. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CN-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is correct.

So that reaction requires acid for the protonation. So reagent A would be something that provides H+ ions, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So that would narrow it down to A or B.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but how? The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent. The product is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. But what's the usual reagent for that? I think under acidic conditions, with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or other such oxidizing agents. But in this case, the reagent B is H2O, but wait, the question says reagent B is added with H2O.

Wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under certain conditions.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can produce different products depending on the conditions. For example, under acidic conditions, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, but under basic conditions, they might form amines or amides, or other products.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So the molecule has a structure where the nitrile group is attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group. So it's something like RC(OH)CN. When this is treated with water and a reagent B, it becomes RCOOH (or RCOO^-).

So perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. But under what conditions does that happen?

Nitrile to carboxylic acid usually requires strong oxidizing conditions. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But the reagent in this case is B with H2O. So perhaps B is a strong acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So HCl is a strong acid, while CH3COOH is a weak acid.

So for the second reaction, to oxidize the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, perhaps the conditions are acidic. So the nitrile would be hydrolyzed in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe with H2O and heat, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Wait another angle. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is that the nitrile group is attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and a butane chain (but in reality, it's a four-carbon chain, but I'm not going to get into that). So the molecule is R-C(OH)-CN, where R is 4-benzylphenyl.

When this is treated with H2O and reagent B, it becomes R-COOH.

So perhaps the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being hydrolyzed, but under what conditions?

Wait, wait. Another thought: the nitrile group can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to give a carboxylic acid. But for that, you'd need something like HCl (a strong acid) and heating. Or maybe using a base and then acidifying.

Wait, but the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. So if B is HCl, then in the presence of water, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe the presence of HCl (as a catalyst) facilitates this.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis where the nitrile is converted to an amide first, then to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the product, the nitrile has become a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. To do that, the conditions must be such that the nitrile is oxidized.

Wait, but oxidation of nitriles requires strong oxidizing agents. For example, KMnO4 in acidic conditions. But the reagent B here is either HCl or CH3COOH. So perhaps the reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about nitrile hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, but typically, this requires heat and a catalyst like HCl. Under basic conditions, they hydrolyze to amines, but that's if you have a lot of base.

Wait, but in this case, reagent B is H2O, and the reagent is either HCl or acetic acid. So if B is HCl, then the solution is acidic. That would promote the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. On the other hand, if B is acetic acid, which is a weak acid, maybe it's not enough to drive the reaction to completion, but I'm not entirely certain.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D). So if in the second reaction, HCl is used, then it's a strong acid that would facilitate the hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

Putting it all together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ (so A is H3O+). That would be options A or B.

Second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid, which requires HCl as the reagent (B is HCl). So options A or C.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

Wait, but earlier I thought that for the first reaction, A would be H3O+. So option A and B have A as H3O+. But if the second reaction requires HCl, then the correct option would be A.

So option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Let me double-check. The first reaction is formation of cyanohydrin, which requires acidic conditions. So A is H3O+ (so options A and B are possible). The second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid, which needs an acidic environment (HCl), so B is HCl. That points to option A.

Alternatively, wait—could the first reaction involve a different reagent? Could the first reaction be using H2SO4, but in the options, H3O+ is provided by H3O+ (like H2SO4, which is H+ and SO4^2-). Alternatively, maybe the first reaction uses NaHSO3. Wait, but what's NaHSO3 used for?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to give a diol. Wait, no, that's when the nitrile is treated with NaHSO3 and water, which leads to the formation of a ketone or a secondary alcohol. Wait, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, but in the first reaction, we're adding NaCN to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin. So the reagent is NaCN and H3O+ (acid) for the first step. So the first part is correct.

So the first reagent A is H3O+. The second reaction's reagent B is HCl, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, while the second reaction involves the oxidation of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Reaction 1: Formation of Cyanohydrin
Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of CN⁻ to the carbonyl group of the ketone, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. To complete the reaction, acidic conditions are required to protonate the intermediate and stabilize the hydroxyl group in the final cyanohydrin product. Therefore, reagent A must provide H⁺ ions, such as H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2: Oxidation of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. This typically requires acidic conditions to facilitate hydrolysis. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is more effective than CH₃COOH (a weak acid) in driving the reaction to completion. Thus, reagent B must be HCl.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This is consistent with the requirements for both reactions. Acidic conditions (H₃O⁺) are needed for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in the second reaction.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is typically used for nitrile hydrolysis, not cyanohydrin formation.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Similar to Option C, NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
