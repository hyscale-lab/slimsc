Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of matrices and their applications in QM. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Then, there are four statements (A to D), and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm. Let's think about each option one by one.

First, let me recall some concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Unitary matrices are used for the time evolution of a quantum state, so the evolution operator must be unitary. Also, the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Oh right, because if A is anti-Hermitian (A† = -A), then exp(A) is unitary.

So, starting with the matrices:

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Wait, no, wait, the first line is (0,0,1), second (0,1,0), third (1,0,0). So W is a 3x3 matrix. Let me check if it's Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. W's elements are all real, so its conjugate transpose is just its transpose. What's W's transpose?

W^T would be:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Which is the same as W. So W is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So W is Hermitian. 

X is:
i  -1  2i
1  0   1
2i -1 -i

Wait, let me write it out properly. Rows are separated by semicolons. So first row: i, -1, 2i; second: 1, 0, 1; third: 2i, -1, -i.

I need to check if X is Hermitian. For X to be Hermitian, X† should equal X. Let's compute X†.

X's elements:

Row 1, column 1: i → when transposed, becomes column 1, row 1, which is i's conjugate. i's conjugate is -i.

Row 1, column 2: -1 → becomes row 2, column 1. Its conjugate is -1 (since it's real).

Row 1, column 3: 2i → becomes row 3, column 1. Conjugate is -2i.

Row 2, column 1: 1 → becomes row 1, column 2. Its conjugate is 1.

Row 2, column 2: 0 → becomes row 2, column 2. Conjugate is 0.

Row 2, column 3: 1 → becomes row 3, column 2. Conjugate is 1.

Row 3, column 1: 2i → becomes row 1, column 3. Conjugate is -2i.

Row 3, column 2: -1 → becomes row 2, column 3. Conjugate is -1.

Row 3, column 3: -i → becomes row 3, column 3. Conjugate is i.

So putting this together, X† would be:
Row 1: [-i, 1, -2i]
Row 2: [ -1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [ -2i, -1, i ]

Wait, let me write this correctly. So X† is:

- First row: X's first column elements' conjugates. 

So X's first column is i, 1, 2i. Their conjugates are -i, 1, -2i. So first row of X† is [-i, -1, ...? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you take the conjugate transpose, each element [j,k] in X becomes [k,j] in X†. So, for X†, the (1,1) element is (X's (1,1))† which is (i)* = -i. (1,2) is (X (2,1))† which is 1. (1,3) is (X (3,1))† which is (2i)* = -2i.

Similarly, second row: (2,1) is (X (1,2))† → (-1)* = -1. (2,2) is (X (2,2))† → 0. (2,3) is (X (3,2))† → (-1)* = -1.

Third row: (3,1) is (X (1,3))† → (2i)* = -2i. (3,2) is (X (2,3))† → 1. (3,3) is (X (3,3))† → (-i)* = i.

So X† is:

[ -i   -1    -2i ]
[  1    0     1 ]
[ -2i  -1    i ]

Now, let's compare X with X†. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, X† is not equal to X. For example, the (1,1) element of X is i, while (1,1) of X† is -i. So X is not equal to its conjugate transpose. So X is not Hermitian. So X is not an observable.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating X†? Let me double-check. Let me write out X and its conjugate transpose step by step.

X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, the conjugate of X (X*) would be:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose that. So the conjugate transpose, X†, is the transpose of X*. So, the (j,k) element of X* becomes the (k,j) element of X†.

X* is:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

So, when you transpose it, the first row becomes the first column.

So, X† is:

Column 1: -i, 1, -2i → Row 1: -i, 1, -2i?

Wait, no: when you take the transpose, the first column of X* becomes the first row of X†.

Wait, X* is:

Row 1: a, b, c → becomes columns a, b, c.

So, the first column of X* is [ -i, 1, -2i ].

So, when transposed, the first row of X† is [ -i, 1, -2i ].

Second column of X* is [ -1, 0, -1 ] → becomes second row of X†: [ -1, 0, -1 ].

Third column of X* is [ -2i, 1, i ] → becomes third row of X†: [ -2i, 1, i ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The third column of X* is [ -2i, 1, i ].

So when you transpose, each column becomes a row. So the first row is the first column, which is [ -i, 1, -2i ].

Second row is second column: [ -1, 0, -1 ].

Third row is third column: [ -2i, 1, i ].

So, X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Comparing to X:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is definitely not equal to X, so X is not Hermitian. So X is not an observable.

Wait, but what about if X is anti-Hermitian? An anti-Hermitian matrix satisfies X† = -X. Let's check:

Is X† equal to -X?

Looking at elements:

X is:

i, -1, 2i

1, 0, 1

2i, -1, -i

-X would be:

- i, 1, -2i

-1, 0, -1

-2i, 1, i

Which is actually equal to X†. Because X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i → same as -X's row 1.

Row 2: -1, 0, -1 → same as -X's row 2.

Row 3: -2i, 1, i → same as -X's row 3.

So yes, X† = -(-X) → wait, no, X† = -X ?

Wait, no, because X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i → same as -X's row 1.

Row 2: -1, 0, -1 → same as -X's row 2.

Row 3: -2i, 1, i → same as -X's row 3.

So X† equals -(X). So X is anti-Hermitian.

So, X is anti-Hermitian. Therefore, exp(X) would be unitary. Because the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Since unitary matrices have the property that their inverses are their conjugate transposes, this is important for the time evolution operator.

Now, looking at the options, let's proceed.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is a unitary matrix. Unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors. So multiplying by e^X (which is unitary) should preserve the norm of any vector. So there does not exist such a vector that when multiplied by e^X, the norm changes. So statement A is false. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. But here, the expression is (e^X) Y (e^{-X}).

Wait, e^{-X} would be the inverse of e^X, since e^X is unitary (and unitary matrices have inverses equal to their conjugate transposes). So, (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation of Y by e^X. But Y is a given matrix.

Wait, what's Y? Y is:

0.5, 0.1, 0.2

0.1, 0.25, 0.1

0.2, 0.1, 0.25

Hmm, let's check if Y is Hermitian. All elements are real, so Y† is the transpose of Y. Let me compute Y's transpose:

Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2 → same as Y's first column.

Wait, Y's first column is 0.5, 0.1, 0.2. Transpose would make that the first row. So Y is symmetric. So Y is Hermitian.

So Y is Hermitian, but is it a density matrix? To be a density matrix, it must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1.

Trace of Y: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So trace is 1.

Is Y positive semi-definite? Let's compute its eigenvalues. Alternatively, check if all the leading principal minors are positive.

Compute the first minor: 0.5 > 0.

Second leading minor: determinant of top-left 2x2:

(0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.1) = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115 > 0.

Third leading minor is the determinant of Y itself. Let me compute it.

Y is:

0.5 0.1 0.2

0.1 0.25 0.1

0.2 0.1 0.25

The determinant can be computed as follows. Let's expand along the first row.

0.5 * det( [0.25, 0.1; 0.1, 0.25] ) - 0.1 * det( [0.1, 0.1; 0.2, 0.25] ) + 0.2 * det( [0.1, 0.25; 0.2, 0.1] )

Compute each part:

First part: 0.5 * (0.25*0.25 - 0.1*0.1) = 0.5*(0.0625 - 0.01) = 0.5 * 0.0525 = 0.02625.

Second part: -0.1 * (0.1*0.25 - 0.1*0.2) = -0.1 * (0.025 - 0.02) = -0.1 * 0.005 = -0.0005.

Third part: 0.2 * (0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2) = 0.2 * (0.01 - 0.05) = 0.2*(-0.04) = -0.008.

Adding them all together: 0.02625 -0.0005 -0.008 = 0.02625 -0.0085 = 0.01775. So determinant is positive.

Since all leading minors are positive, Y is positive definite, hence positive semi-definite. So Y is a valid density matrix, representing a quantum state.

Now, the expression (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation. Since e^X is unitary, the transformed matrix Y' = e^X Y e^{-X} is similar to Y. Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. Since Y is positive definite, Y' will also be positive definite. Also, the trace is preserved under similarity transformations. Y had trace 1, so Y' will too. So Y' is also a density matrix, hence represents a quantum state.

Wait, but wait. The expression in option B is (e^X)* Y * (e^{-X}), so the same as e^X Y e^{-X}, which is Y' as I said. So since Y' is a density matrix, option B claims that it represents a quantum state, which is correct. So option B is correct.

But let me not jump to conclusions yet. Let me check the other options.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

We already saw that X is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian, so X is not an observable. What about Z?

Z is:

3, 2i, 5

-2i, -2, -4i

5, 4i, 4

Let me check if Z is Hermitian. Z† would be the conjugate transpose.

Original Z:

Row 1: 3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row 3:5,4i,4

Z† is the conjugate transpose. So:

First, take the transpose of Z.

Z^T:

Row 1: 3, -2i,5

Row 2: 2i, -2,4i

Row 3:5, -4i,4

Now, take the conjugate of each element.

So Z† would be:

Row 1: 3, 2i,5 → because (Row 1 of Z^T: 3, -2i,5) → conjugate: 3, 2i,5.

Row 2: 2i → becomes -2i (Wait, Row 2 of Z^T is 2i, -2, 4i. Conjugate each: (2i)* = -2i, (-2)* = -2, (4i)* = -4i. So row 2 of Z†: -2i, -2, -4i.

Row 3:5→5, -4i→4i,4→4. So Row 3 of Z^T:5, -4i,4 → conjugate:5,4i,4.

So Z† is:

3, 2i, 5

-2i, -2, -4i

5,4i,4

Wait, comparing to Z:

Z is:

3, 2i,5

-2i, -2, -4i

5,4i,4

Yes, Z equals Z†. So Z is Hermitian. So Z is an observable. But X is not. So the statement in option C says Z and X are observables. But X is not, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is a unitary matrix. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, W: is it unitary?

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

To check if W is unitary, compute W† W and see if it's the identity matrix.

W is symmetric, as we saw earlier, so W† = W.

W† W = W^2.

Let me compute W^2:

W^2 = W * W.

Compute each element:

Row 1 of W: [0,0,1]

Multiplying by each column of W:

Element (1,1): [0,0,1] * [0,0,1]^T = 0*0 + 0*0 +1*1 =1

(1,2): [0,0,1] * [0,1,0]^T = 0 +0 +0=0

(1,3): [0,0,1] * [1,0,0]^T = 0 +0 +0=0

So row 1 of W^2 is [1,0,0]

Row 2 of W: [0,1,0]

Multiply each column:

(2,1): 0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0

(2,2): 0*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1

(2,3): 0*1 +1*0 +0*0 =0

So row 2: [0,1,0]

Row3: [1,0,0]

Multiply each:

(3,1): 1*0 +0*0 +0*1 =0

(3,2):1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0

(3,3):1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1

So row3: [0,0,1]

So W^2 is:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1 → which is the identity matrix.

So W is unitary. So W is a valid evolution operator.

What about X? Earlier, I found that X is anti-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary. But is X itself unitary? Let me check.

Wait, X is anti-Hermitian, so X† = -X. So W is unitary, but X? Let me compute X† X and see if it's identity.

Compute X† X.

X is:

i, -1,2i

1, 0,1

2i,-1,-i

X† is:

-i, 1, -2i

-1, 0, -1

-2i, 1, i

So, X† X:

Compute each element:

Row 1 of X† times columns of X.

(1,1): (-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i) 

Let me compute each term:

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

(1)(1) =1.

(-2i)(2i)= -4i²= -4*(-1)=4.

So (1,1) = 1 +1 +4=6.

(1,2): (-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(-1)

= i +0 + 2i → 3i.

(1,3): (-i)(2i) + 1*(1) + (-2i)(-i)

= (-2i²) +1 + (2i²)

= (2) +1 + (-2) = 1.

Wait, let me see:

(-i)(2i) = -2 i² = 2.

(1)(1) =1.

(-2i)(-i) = 2 i² = -2.

So total 2 +1 -2 =1.

So first row of X†X is [6,3i,1].

Wait, that can't be right. Because for X†X to be identity, (1,1) should be 1, but it's 6. So X is not unitary. So X itself isn't unitary, but its exponential is.

So for option D: W and X are evolution operators. But X is not unitary, only e^X is. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing X†X. Let me recheck:

Compute X† X:

First, X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Multiply X† (3x3) with X (3x3):

Compute element (1,1):

(-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)

= (-i²) + 1 + (-4i²)

= (1) +1 +4 =6.

Because i squared is -1, so (-i)(i)= -i²=1.

Similarly, (-2i)(2i)= -4i²=4.

So (1,1)=6.

Which is not 1, so X† X isn't identity. So X isn't unitary. So option D is incorrect.

So, back to option B: (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state. As I thought earlier, Y is a density matrix, and similarity transformations by unitary matrices preserve the density matrix properties (positive semi-definite and trace 1). So the transformed matrix is also a valid density matrix, hence represents a quantum state. So option B is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Because e^X is unitary, right? Because X is anti-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary. Therefore, the transformation is a unitary conjugation of Y. So Y' = e^X Y e^{-X} is similar to Y, so same eigenvalues. Since Y is a density matrix, Y' is too. So it's a valid quantum state.

So, option B is correct. The other options (A, C, D) are incorrect.

Wait, but looking back, option B says (e^X)* Y * (e^{-X}). But e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X, which is (e^X)†.

So it's (e^X) Y (e^X)†. Which is the same as e^X Y e^{-X}, since (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X} because X is anti-Hermitian.

So yes, the expression is correct.

So the correct statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


In quantum mechanics, the properties of matrices are crucial for understanding their roles in the theory. Here, we analyze the given matrices \( W \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) to evaluate the correctness of the statements provided.

### Key Analysis of the Matrices and Statements:

#### **Matrix \( W \):**
\[
W = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\]
- \( W \) is symmetric and real, so it is **Hermitian**.
- \( W^2 = I \) (identity matrix), so \( W \) is **unitary**.
- Therefore, \( W \) can represent the evolution operator of a quantum system.

#### **Matrix \( X \):**
\[
X = \begin{pmatrix} 
i & -1 & 2i \\ 
1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
2i & -1 & -i 
\end{pmatrix}
\]
- \( X \) is **anti-Hermitian** because \( X^\dagger = -X \).
- The exponential \( e^X \) is **unitary**, as the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary.
- However, \( X \) itself is not unitary, as \( X^\dagger X \neq I \).

#### **Matrix \( Y \):**
\[
Y = \begin{pmatrix} 
0.5 & 0.1 & 0.2 \\ 
0.1 & 0.25 & 0.1 \\ 
0.2 & 0.1 & 0.25 
\end{pmatrix}
\]
- \( Y \) is symmetric and real, so it is **Hermitian**.
- The trace of \( Y \) is 1, and all leading principal minors are positive, so \( Y \) is **positive semi-definite**.
- \( Y \) is a valid **density matrix**, representing a quantum state.

#### **Matrix \( Z \):**
\[
Z = \begin{pmatrix} 
3 & 2i & 5 \\ 
-2i & -2 & -4i \\ 
5 & 4i & 4 
\end{pmatrix}
\]
- \( Z \) is symmetric and real, so it is **Hermitian**.
- \( Z \) is not unitary, as \( Z^\dagger Z \neq I \).

### Evaluation of the Statements:

#### **Option A:**  
" There exists a vector to which if one multiplies \( e^X \), the norm of the vector changes."  
- \( e^X \) is unitary because \( X \) is anti-Hermitian. Unitary matrices preserve the norm of any vector.  
- Therefore, this statement is **false**.

#### **Option B:**  
"\( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a quantum state."  
- \( e^X \) is unitary, so \( e^{-X} = (e^X)^\dagger \).  
- The expression \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is a similarity transformation of \( Y \) by \( e^X \).  
- Since \( Y \) is a density matrix (Hermitian, positive semi-definite, trace 1), and similarity transformations preserve these properties, \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is also a valid density matrix.  
- Therefore, this statement is **true**.

#### **Option C:**  
" \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables."  
- Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices.  
- \( Z \) is Hermitian and represents an observable.  
- \( X \) is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian, so it does not represent an observable.  
- Since \( X \) is not Hermitian, this statement is **false**.

#### **Option D:**  
" \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of some quantum system."  
- The evolution operator must be unitary.  
- \( W \) is unitary and can represent the evolution operator.  
- \( X \) is not unitary, only \( e^X \) is unitary.  
- Therefore, this statement is **false**.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a valid quantum state.

**Answer: B**
