Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the value of 'a'. Hmm, let's think about what I know.

The problem says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when you measure the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square magnitude gives the probability density, and if the wave function is zero, the probability is zero there.

So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, actually, the wave function in quantum mechanics is usually a complex function, but the square of the absolute value gives the probability. But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex number. But for the wave function to be a valid solution, I think the modulus squared should integrate to 1, because the total probability must be 1.

But wait, the wave function is given as a function of x. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. Let me think: if the wave function is zero for x<1 and x>3, then the region where the wave function is non-zero is between x=1 and x=3. So the given wave function must represent that.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but where is this valid? It must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the given wave function is actually only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. But the problem says that none were found at x<1 and x>3, so that's correct.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the wave function is a combination of real and imaginary parts. In reality, the wave function for a particle in a potential that confines it to a region would have a real part, but sometimes could have an imaginary part. But for a stationary state, the wave function is either real or has a time-dependent exponential factor. Hmm, perhaps this is a time-independent case, so maybe the imaginary part comes from an exponential factor.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about normalization. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1. Because the wave function must be normalized.

So |ψ(x)|² is the square of the modulus. So ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real and -0.5i is imaginary. So when squared, the cross terms would involve 2 * (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) which when multiplied by their conjugate would be zero? Wait, no, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So:

|ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + [ (-0.5) ]^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of this expression must equal 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx, from 1 to 3.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the modulus is | (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i | squared. So that's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but that seems a bit strange because the first term is a function of x, and the second is a constant. Let me compute these integrals.

The first integral is a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluated from 1 to 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the sum is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What is ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. Then a² ≈ 0.721 → a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is approximately this value. So the answer should be B.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually expressed as a function that's either real or purely imaginary because time dependence is handled by a phase factor. But in this case, it's a combination of real and imaginary parts. Hmm, but if the wave function is a sum of real and imaginary parts, then when we compute the modulus squared, it's just the sum of squares of each component. But I think that's correct as I did earlier.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculation. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² ln(2) + 0.5. So setting that equal to 1:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Calculating that:

ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and it is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability is 1, which means:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

We split this into two integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. The first integral is:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+3) - \ln(1+1)\right] = a^2 \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. The second integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
