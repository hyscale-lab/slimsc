Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm. Wait, wait. The structure of the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene rings are numbered in a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if it's 1-bromo and something else at position 2, then maybe the structure is a bromobenzene with another substituent at position 2. Oh, but the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it's 2-bromo-1-dimethylamino benzene? Wait no, wait. Wait, perhaps the "d" stands for something. Oh, I think the correct IUPAC name would be 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene. Or maybe it's 2-dimethylaminophenyl bromide? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 on the benzene ring each have substituents. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, the "d" in the name might be a typo. But let's proceed assuming that the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethylamine, which would be 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Sodium amide is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in elimination reactions. Wait, but wait. Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base and can abstract protons, leading to elimination or possibly aromatic substitution.

Wait, considering that the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative. When you have a bromobenzene ring with a strong base like NaNH2, it's possible that an elimination reaction occurs, especially if there's a possibility for forming a double bond or some kind of conjugated system.

But wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reactions of bromobenzene derivatives with strong bases. Another possibility is nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups. Wait, the substituent in position 2 is a dimethylamino group. Amino groups are strong activating groups, especially when they are in the ortho or para positions. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it's abstracting a proton leading to some kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps the dimethylamino group is a leaving group? No, that's not likely because amines are not good leaving groups. Wait, but I'm mixing things up. Wait, the bromide is a good leaving group, so perhaps a substitution reaction is possible.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that usually involves adjacent leaving groups. Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure again. The bromine is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group is at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent on the benzene ring. So perhaps when NaNH2 is added, it abstracts a proton beta to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, in benzene, the ring is already conjugated. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about aromatic substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, so perhaps the base is abstracting a proton alpha to the amino group, leading to some kind of aromatic rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a benzyne intermediate. Wait, that's a possibility. Benzynes are typically formed when two adjacent substituents are removed, leading to a triple bond on the ring. So if we have a bromine and another leaving group adjacent (like in 1 and 2 positions), treatment with a strong base could eliminate both groups, producing a benzyne intermediate. But in this case, the substituents are bromine and dimethylamino. Wait, the dimethylamino group isn't a leaving group, but perhaps if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to both groups, leading to elimination.

Wait a second, let me think: if you have a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a strong activating group (like -N(CH3)2) at position 2, and you treat with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps the NH2- acts as a base and abstracts a proton that's para to the amino group. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's ortho to the amino group, leading to some kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps the correct reaction is aromatic substitution. Let's consider that the amino group is strongly activating, so it directs incoming groups to the para position relative to itself. But wait, the bromine is at position 1, which is adjacent to the amino group (position 2). So if the reaction is a substitution, perhaps the bromide leaves, but I don't think NaNH2 is a good nucleophile for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation type of elimination to form a triple bond.

Wait, another thought: if the ring has Br at position 1 and a strong activating group (like the amino) at position 2, perhaps the base will abstract a proton from position 3, leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate. But for benzyne formation, you usually need two adjacent leaving groups. In this case, perhaps the Br and a hydrogen adjacent to it are removed. Wait, but the amino group is at position 2, so perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2, leading to elimination of Br from position 1 and H from position 3. That would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, making a benzyne.

Once benzyne is formed, it can undergo various reactions, such as cycloaddition reactions, but in this case, perhaps the benzyne can react with the ammonia (NH3) or the solvent, which is condensed ammonia, to form different products.

Wait, but how many products can form from this benzyne intermediate? Benzyne is symmetric, so when it reacts, it can lead to different substitution patterns depending on where the attack happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via benzyne. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to imagine the structure again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons. So positions 1 (Br) and 2 (N(CH3)2) are adjacent.

In such a case, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it's possible that the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond. But wait, the amino group is activating, which could facilitate the elimination.

So if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 (which is meta to the amino group and adjacent to position 2?), wait, no, position 3 is next to position 2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (where the amino group is) and position 4, perhaps.

Wait, but eliminating H from position 3 and Br from position 1 would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, creating a benzyne (aryne) structure. So the benzene ring would become highly strained with a triple bond between C1 and C2, making it a diradical or an aryne intermediate.

Once the benzyne is formed, it can react with a nucleophile, like ammonia. But in this reaction, the solvent is condensed ammonia. So perhaps the ammonia acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, benzyne can react with ammonia to form different products. Let me recall: benzyne can react with ammonia to form benzene rings with two amino groups added. But wait, how does that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo [2+2] cycloaddition with ammonia, but that might not be the case here. Alternatively, the benzyne might undergo ring-opening reactions, adding substituents in a way that depends on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can add two ammonia molecules, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne intermediate can dimerize or form different products, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of aniline derivatives.

Wait, but let me step back. How many products would form from this reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the reaction is an elimination to form benzyne, which can then add ammonia in two different ways, leading to two products. But wait, how?

Wait, another angle: in the presence of a strong base, a possible reaction is the formation of aniline via elimination of HBr. But that doesn't seem right because the amino group is already present. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between substitution and elimination.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from the benzylic position, but in benzene, the positions are sp2 hybridized, so there's no benzylic hydrogen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the aromatic ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires electron-withdrawing groups. However, the dimethylamino group is an electron-donating group, which makes the ring more activated towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's deprotonating the dimethylamino group, but that would be difficult because amines are generally not deprotonated under such conditions. Wait, but wait. NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating the dimethylamino group, turning it into a strong base. But dimethylamine is a weak base, and NaNH2 is a stronger base, so maybe it can deprotonate it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts a proton alpha to both the Br and the amino group, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond, but that's unlikely in a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), which can then react further.

If benzyne is formed, then the reaction with ammonia (NH3) could lead to different products. Benzyne can react with one equivalent of ammonia to form aniline derivatives, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think when benzyne reacts with ammonia, it can add two ammonia molecules across the triple bond, leading to a 1,2-diaminobenzene (o-phenylenediamine). But wait, that would require two ammonia molecules adding. Alternatively, perhaps benzyne can add one molecule of ammonia to form an intermediate which then loses a hydrogen, leading to a single amino group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces either para-phenylenediamine or some other isomer, but given the starting structure, perhaps only one product is formed. Or maybe two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can react in two different positions, but given the symmetry, maybe it leads to only one product.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. When the benzyne forms, the positions where the triple bond is would be between C1 and C2. Then, when the ammonia attacks, perhaps the addition can happen in such a way that the amino groups add to C1 and C2, leading to a 1,2-diaminobenzene derivative.

But then, where is the dimethylamino group in this scenario? Wait, no, the starting material has a dimethylamino group at position 2. Oh wait, perhaps after elimination, the dimethylamino group is removed as part of the elimination process. So when the benzyne forms, the starting substituents (Br and N(CH3)2) are eliminated, perhaps.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, elimination would involve losing H and Br from adjacent positions. So perhaps the dimethylamino group is not directly involved in the elimination. Wait, no, the dimethylamino is at position 2, and the Br is at position 1. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then Br at position 1 and H at position 3 are eliminated, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But then, the dimethylamino group remains at position 2.

Wait, but wait, after elimination, the dimethylamino group would be at position 2, and the triple bond is between 1 and 2, so the ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a dimethylamino group on C2.

But that would make the benzyne structure a bit different, perhaps leading to different reaction pathways.

Once the benzyne forms, treatment with ammonia might lead to different products depending on where the attack occurs. But since the benzyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a dimethylamino at C2, perhaps the addition of ammonia is directed to specific positions.

Wait, but the ring is now highly strained due to the triple bond, so it's more reactive. The attack of ammonia could happen on either end of the triple bond, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the dimethylamino group directs the attack to the para position, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but after elimination, the remaining substituent is the dimethylamino group at position 2. So when the benzyne forms, perhaps the triple bond is between positions 1 and 2, and the dimethylamino is on position 2.

When the benzyne reacts with ammonia, the nucleophile (NH3) could attack either end of the triple bond. Since the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the dimethylamino is on C2, perhaps the attack occurs at C1 (which was the original position of the Br) or at C3 (but wait, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, so the adjacent positions are C3 and C6 for C1, and C3 and C2 for C2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to draw this mentally.

After elimination, the structure would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a dimethylamino group at C2. So the ring looks like:

Positions:
1 (triple bond to 2)
2 (triple bond to 1 and has N(CH3)2)
3 (adjacent to 2)
4 (opposite 2)
5 (opposite 1)
6

So the triple bond is between 1 and 2. The attack by ammonia could happen at either end of the triple bond. So if it attacks at C1, then a new C-N bond forms there, and perhaps another attack could happen elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the ammonia adds across the triple bond, forming a single bond and releasing some product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of two ammonia molecules across the triple bond, leading to a single bond. So the product would have two amino groups added, but where?

Wait, if the triple bond is between positions 1 and 2, then adding two NH3 molecules would lead to substituents at positions 1 and 2. But the dimethylamino group is already at position 2, so that's not possible. So perhaps the addition occurs at positions 1 and 3, but that doesn't align with the triple bond structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack happens at position 3, which is adjacent to the dimethylamino group at 2, leading to a different product.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products instead.

If the benzyne forms and then reacts with ammonia, how many different products can form? Considering the structure of the benzyne, perhaps two different products are possible due to the positions where the ammonia attacks. But wait, if the ring is symmetric in some way, maybe only one product is formed.

Wait, in this case, the benzyne has a substituent (dimethylamino) at position 2, and the triple bond between 1 and 2. So when ammonia attacks, it can attack either end of the triple bond. If the attack is at position 1, perhaps one product forms, and attack at position 2 (but position 2 already has the dimethylamino group, so perhaps that's not possible). Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs at position 3, but that's not on the triple bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a single product. Or perhaps two products.

Wait, when the benzyne is formed, it's highly strained and can undergo various additions. If it reacts with ammonia, maybe it adds two amino groups in such a way that the product has amino groups at positions 1 and 2, but that would mean the dimethylamino is replaced, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the dimethylamino stays, and the new amino groups are added elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed through benzyne. Maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group. So perhaps the base causes a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced by an amine. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) would require a good leaving group and a strong activating group. Wait, Br is a good leaving group, but the ring is activated by the amino group. So perhaps the Br is replaced by something else, like NH2.

Wait, but in this case, the solvent is ammonia. So perhaps the NH2- acts as a nucleophile, substituting the Br. So the product would be 2-dimethylaminoaniline (but wait, that's aniline with another substituent). Or perhaps the product is 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Wait, but would that substitution occur under these conditions? SNAr typically requires deprotonation of the ring to form a Meisenheimer complex, but I'm not sure if NaNH2 in ammonia would facilitate that. Also, the amino group is a strong activating group, making the ring susceptible to electrophilic substitution but not nucleophilic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the amino group, making it a better leaving group, but I'm not sure that's feasible.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination to form benzyne, which then can undergo [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions, but that would require a diene, which isn't present here. Alternatively, maybe the benzyne is trapped by ammonia, leading to the formation of aniline derivatives.

But I'm not confident about the exact number of products. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the reaction forms a benzyne intermediate, and then ammonia adds to it, perhaps the product is 1,2-diaminobenzene (o-phenylenediamine). But wait, in our case, the starting material has a dimethylamino group at position 2. After elimination, that group would be gone, right? Or does it stay?

Wait, no, elimination would remove the Br and a proton, but the dimethylamino group would remain. So the benzyne would have the dimethylamino group at position 2 and a triple bond between 1 and 2. So when ammonia attacks, perhaps the amino groups add at positions 1 and 3, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne structure would allow for two possible products when adding ammonia, but given the substituents, maybe only one product is formed.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via benzyne at all and instead undergoes a different mechanism, like substitution, leading to a single product.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products of each scenario.

Scenario 1: Benzyne formation leads to two possible products. But due to the substituent, only one product is possible.

Scenario 2: Substitution reaction leads to a single product.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne leads to one product, making the total number of products one.

Wait, but the starting material is a mono-substituted bromobenzene with a dimethylamino group, which is a strong activating group. So the possibilities are:

1. Elimination to form benzyne, which reacts with ammonia to form a single product.

2. Substitution of Br with NH2, leading to a single product.

But in the conditions given (NaNH2 in ammonia), the reaction is more likely to favor elimination (dehydrohalogenation) rather than substitution because NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile.

So if elimination occurs, forming benzyne, which then adds ammonia in a certain way.

But how many products result from that?

Wait, perhaps the benzyne can form two different products based on where the ammonia attacks. But considering the substituents, maybe only one product is possible.

Wait, let me think about the benzyne structure again. The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the dimethylamino group is at C2.

When the triple bond is present, the ring is highly strained, so ammonia can attack either end. But because the dimethylamino is at C2, the attack on C1 might be more favorable due to the steric effects or electronic factors. Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs symmetrically, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the dimethylamino group directs the attack to a specific position, leading to a single product.

Wait, but if the attack occurs at C1, then the product would have an amino group at C1 and the dimethylamino at C2. That would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Alternatively, if the attack occurs at C3, perhaps due to some symmetry, leading to another product.

But wait, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, so the positions adjacent are C3 and C6 for C1, and C3 and C2 for C2.

Wait, maybe the attack can happen at either end of the triple bond, leading to different substituents. So if the attack is on C1, you get a product with amino at C1 and dimethylamino at C2. If the attack is on C2, but C2 already has N(CH3)2, that's not possible, so perhaps the attack occurs on C1 or C3.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other possibilities.

Another possibility: the reaction could deprotonate the dimethylamino group, but I'm not sure under what conditions that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, leading to the formation of benzene with a triple bond, which would be a very reactive intermediate. But without knowing the exact pathway, it's hard to say.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products. If the reaction forms a benzyne intermediate, which can react in two different ways, leading to two products, then the answer would be C) 2.

But another possibility is that only one product is formed, so the answer would be B) 1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the loss of Br and the dimethylamino group, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, wait! Maybe the reaction doesn't form benzyne at all. Perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the Br is replaced by an amine group. So the product would have an amino group where the Br was, and the existing dimethylamino group. So the product would be 2-dimethylaminoaniline (but wait, that's 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene).

But in that case, how does the substitution occur? Because NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Also, the ring is activated by the amino group, making it more susceptible to electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic.

Hmm. I'm still stuck. Maybe I should think of the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and is often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic systems. So perhaps the reaction is elimination, not substitution. That would suggest the formation of a benzyne intermediate.

If benzyne is formed, and then it reacts with ammonia, perhaps it adds two amino groups, but where?

Wait, another thought: when benzyne reacts with ammonia, two equivalents of ammonia can add across the triple bond, leading to the formation of 1,2-diaminobenzene (o-phenylenediamine). But in this case, the starting material has a dimethylamino group at position 2, so perhaps the addition occurs at positions 1 and 3, leading to a different product.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of benzyne with ammonia leads to the formation of a single product, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two products due to different sites of attack, but considering the substituent, maybe only one product is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any products, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two products: one with the amino group at position 3 and another at position 4, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product because the benzyne is symmetric, so the attack can only happen in one way, leading to one product.

Wait, but the presence of the dimethylamino group at position 2 would break the symmetry, so attack could happen in two different ways, leading to two different products.

So, if the benzyne is formed and adds ammonia in two different positions, leading to two products, the answer would be C) 2.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via benzyne and instead via a different pathway, leading to a single product.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, forming a triple bond which then loses the dimethylamino group, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a phenylium ion, which then could lose a proton to form a benzene ring with a hydrogen lost, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction of bromobenzene derivatives with NaNH2 in ammonia. Let me think. Oh wait, I'm just trying to imagine what I know. In typical conditions, NaNH2 in ammonia is used for dehydrohalogenation of bromobenzene to form benzene rings with triple bonds (benzyne), which can then undergo various reactions.

So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, the reaction with NaNH2 would eliminate H and Br to form a triple bond between C1 and C2, creating benzyne. The presence of the dimethylamino group at C2 would direct the reaction in a certain way.

Once the benzyne is formed, it can react with ammonia. Benzyne reacts with ammonia to form o-phenylenediamine (1,2-diaminobenzene) when two equivalents of ammonia are added across the triple bond.

But wait, in our case, the starting material has a dimethylamino group. So when the benzyne forms, does the dimethylamino group remain, or is it lost during elimination? I think it's lost because the elimination involves losing H from C3 (adjacent to C2) and Br from C1, forming the triple bond between C1 and C2. So the dimethylamino group at C2 would no longer be present because that's where the H is abstracted. Wait no, the dimethylamino is at C2, and the H is abstracted from C3. So the dimethylamino group remains at C2, and the triple bond is between C1 and C2.

So the benzyne would have the triple bond between C1 and C2, and the dimethylamino group at C2.

When this benzyne reacts with ammonia, each attack could occur at either C1 or C2. But since C2 already has the dimethylamino group, perhaps the attack occurs at C1 and another position.

Wait, perhaps the attack occurs at C2, but that's where the dimethylamino is. Alternatively, perhaps it attacks at C3, which is adjacent to C2.

Wait, another thought: the benzyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a dimethylamino group at C2. When ammonia attacks, it could add across the triple bond, leading to a single bond and two new C-N bonds. But considering the structure, perhaps the attack can happen in a way that adds an amino group at C1 and another at C3, leading to a 1,3-diaminobenzene structure.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs at C1 and C2, but with the dimethylamino group already at C2, that would lead to a structure that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the replacement of the dimethylamino group with an amino group. But that doesn't seem right.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

- Starting material: 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

- Reaction: NaNH2 in ammonia → elimination to form benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C2), dimethylamino at C2.

- Benzyne reacts with ammonia → possible addition of NH3 across the triple bond.

If two ammonia molecules add across the triple bond, the product would have amino groups at C1 and C2, but since C2 already has the dimethylamino group, perhaps this isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps only one equivalent of ammonia adds, leading to a single amino group at C1, making the product 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

But then, another equivalent of ammonia could add elsewhere, perhaps leading to another product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of the dimethylamino group and the addition of two amino groups, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but if the benzyne structure is symmetric in some way, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can't react under these conditions, so no product forms, but that's unlikely.

Another possibility: the reaction leads to the substitution of the Br by an amino group, making 2-dimethylaminoaniline. But that would require a nucleophilic substitution, which I'm not sure NaNH2 would facilitate.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to two possible products, the answer would be C)2. If only one product forms, the answer is B)1.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a single product via benzyne, which then adds ammonia in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne is symmetric, leading to only one product when reacting with ammonia.

But the presence of the dimethylamino group at C2 would break the symmetry, so perhaps two products are possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of only one product because the attack can only happen in one position due to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps when the benzyne forms, the only possible site for attack is position 3, leading to a single product.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent on this, maybe I should make an educated guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethylamine (1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene) with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia. Sodium amide is a strong base, and such conditions typically favor elimination reactions, particularly dehydrohalogenation, to form a benzyne intermediate. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2, which are adjacent on the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Formation of Benzyne Intermediate**:  
   The strong base (NaNH₂) abstracts a proton β to the bromine atom, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. This creates a benzyne intermediate with the dimethylamino group remaining at position 2.

2. **Reactivity of Benzyne**:  
   Benzyne is a highly reactive intermediate due to its strain and electrophilic nature. In the presence of ammonia (NH₃), the benzyne can react via nucleophilic attack. Ammonia, acting as a nucleophile, can add across the triple bond, leading to the formation of substituted aromatic products.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - **Product 1**: Ammonia can attack the benzyne at position 1, resulting in the formation of 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.  
   - **Product 2**: Ammonia can attack the benzyne at position 3, leading to the formation of 3-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.  

   These two distinct products arise due to the different positions of attack on the benzyne intermediate, which is influenced by the dimethylamino group at position 2.

4. **Symmetry Consideration**:  
   The dimethylamino group at position 2 breaks the symmetry of the benzene ring, making the two possible attack positions (at C1 and C3) distinct and leading to two unique products.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces two possible organic products due to the different sites of nucleophilic attack on the benzyne intermediate. 

Answer: C
