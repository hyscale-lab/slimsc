Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X, which then reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what X is first, and then what happens when it reacts.

Let me start by looking at the IR and NMR data provided. 

The IR data has strong peaks. The big peaks in the 3400-2500 cm-1 region suggest there's an -OH group or maybe an alkyne. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be even broader, maybe around 2500-3000, and a peak at around 1700. But the 1720 is a bit higher, which makes me think it's an ester or maybe a ketone. Then, 1610 and 1450 cm-1—those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So compound X probably has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an -OH proton. So maybe it's a phenol? But wait, if the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring. Because a carboxylic acid would have an -OH around 10-12 ppm. Oh, but the IR didn't show a very broad peak, it's in the 3400-2500 which might suggest an alcohol or maybe an O-H in a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows 10.5 ppm as broad, which is more like an -OH in a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But then the IR has 1720, which could be a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoic acid. Because benzoic acid has both a carbonyl (around 1680-1720) and an -OH.

Looking at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest two substituents opposite each other. So maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a para-substituted benzoic acid.

But wait, the integration for each is 2H, so maybe each substituent is connected to the ring in a way that gives two doublets. For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is opposite another. So perhaps, there are two substituents on the ring, one is the carbonyl group (like a COOH) and another is an alkyl group.

Wait, looking at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, probably from a CH group adjacent to another CH2 or something. Maybe a CH connected to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet integrating to 2H. Could this be a CH2 connected to something, maybe part of a chain attached to the ring.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Like a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group? Or maybe a methyl group attached to a double bond? Wait, no, more likely a CH2 where one of the H's is split into a doublet. Or perhaps it's an isopropyl group. Wait, no, isopropyl would have a septet maybe, but this is a doublet. Hmm.

Wait, 1.4 ppm as a doublet for 3H suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3) group? Or a -CH(CH3)2? No, that would be more like a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. Let me try to piece together the NMR.

So, aromatic ring with two substituents, one being a carbonyl group (like COOH) and another being an alkyl group.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a ketone group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a phenolic -OH. Or maybe an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are around 9-10, but singlet. But aldehyde would be a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons, but maybe it's a benzaldehyde. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH.

Wait, let me think about the integrations:

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) ⇒ so each is a doublet, integrating to 2H each. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene, with substituents in positions 1 and 4. So the substituents are in para positions.

So, perhaps the substituents are a COOH group and a branched alkyl group attached to the ring. Let's imagine the structure: para-(substituent1 and substituent2) benzene. One substituent is a COOH (since the IR has a strong carbonyl), and the other substituent is an alkyl chain.

Looking at the other signals:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), that's a methine (CH) group. Maybe part of a chain attached to the benzene. So the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, for the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): that's a CH3 group attached to a CH2, because the splitting is a doublet, which implies it's next to a CH with one proton. So perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or maybe a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- something? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group?

Wait, let me think about the substituent. If the substituent is a chain like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That's a CH2CH2CH3 group. So that's a terminal CH3, so that suggests a -CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)3CH3 group attached to the ring, but that would be a pentyl group, but maybe branched.

Wait, but the substituent on the ring is at the para position, so perhaps it's a sec-butyl group or something like that. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the structure. So, the benzene ring has a COOH group and a substituent R. The substituent R is attached to the ring, and it's branching into a CH group that has a CH3 group attached.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is two protons, so perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH connecting to another CH2 or something. Let me try to sketch this.

Perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, the signals don't quite match. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group, but that would split the signals differently.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3) which is itself connected to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group but with a branch. Wait, the substituent on the ring is perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a secondary carbon.

Wait, let me think about the integrations:

Total protons in NMR:

10.5 ppm: 1H (the OH)

8.0 ppm: 2H

7.2 ppm: 2H

2.9 ppm: 1H

1.7 ppm: 2H

1.4 ppm: 3H

0.9 ppm: 3H

Total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3=14 H. Hmm, but wait, that's 14? Let me recount: 1 + 2=3, +2=5, +1=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14. So the molecule has 14 hydrogens.

Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each substituent contributes some H. For instance, if one substituent is a COOH group (which doesn't contribute H in the NMR because it's deprotonated? Or does it? Wait, the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is probably the -OH of the COOH group. So the substituent on the ring is a COOH, and the other substituent is a branched alkyl group.

So the substituent R is an alkyl group attached to the ring. Let's think about the Hs in R. The R group has:

- 1H (from 2.9 ppm)

- 2H (from 1.7 ppm)

- 3H (from 1.4 ppm)

- 3H (from 0.9 ppm)

Wait, that sums to 1+2+3+3 = 9 H. So the R group is a 4-carbon group, perhaps?

Wait, maybe it's a propyl chain with a branch. Let me think:

From the NMR:

- The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H): probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the end is a CH2CH2CH3, which is a -CH2CH2CH2- group, but attached to something else.

Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. So maybe it's a CH2 connected to another CH, which is connected to a CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Let me try to break it down:

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, but that doesn't fit because the carbonyl would need to be on the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2CH3 group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Let me think about the NMR for that.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The CH2 would be split into a triplet, but in the NMR, I see a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the terminal CH3. The CH2 adjacent to the CH(CH2CH3) would be a quartet, maybe around 1.7 ppm? Or perhaps the CH itself is at 2.9 ppm.

Wait, the sec-butyl group structure is:

R-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no, the substituent is on the benzene. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the -CH2- would be attached to the benzene, then the CH is attached to that CH2, and the CH has a CH2CH3 group attached.

In that case, the -CH2- would have a triplet integrating to 2H (coupled with the adjacent CH), but in the NMR, I see a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) and another at 2.9 ppm (1H). So maybe the CH is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? So the substituent is a isopropyl chain attached to the ring via a CH2. No, not sure.

Wait, let me look at the options. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me see what they are.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2-COOH attached to a benzene that has an ethyl group in the para position. But the NMR would show perhaps different peaks.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl on the benzene ring.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Let's imagine the structure: the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. So the substituent R is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent R is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be:

Ph–COOH and Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

So, the NMR for the R group: the -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene. The CH2 would be split into a quartet, perhaps. The CH would be split into a multiplet, and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals for a sec-butyl group.

For a sec-butyl group:

The structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

The protons on the CH2 (attached to benzene) would be adjacent to the CH group. So the -CH2- would have two protons, which would be split by the neighboring CH group. The CH group has two neighboring groups: the CH2 and the CH2CH3. So the CH's proton would be a multiplet. The CH2CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to the CH.

So in the NMR, the signals would be:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene): perhaps a quartet (coupled with the CH), integrating to 2H.

- The CH: a multiplet (maybe 1H, integrating to 1H).

- The CH2CH3: a triplet, integrating to 3H at around 1.2 ppm? But in our data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which is more typical of a terminal CH3 group, like in a -CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the CH2CH3 is attached to the CH, which is attached to the CH2. So the CH2CH3 would be a triplet, but perhaps at a lower ppm.

Wait, in the given data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, probably a -CH2CH2CH3. So that would mean that the substituent R has a longer chain.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a tert-pentyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the substituent R is a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent R is: -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So, on the benzene, the substituents are COOH and -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Let me break down the NMR signals for this substituent:

The -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

The -CH2- would be adjacent to the benzene. Let's say that the CH2 is next to the benzene. So the -CH2- would have two protons, coupled with the CH. The CH would have one proton, coupled to the CH2 and the adjacent CH2CH3.

The CH2CH3 would be a triplet, because the CH2 is connected to the CH which has one proton.

So in the NMR:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene): quartet (J= coupling with CH), 2H around 1.7 ppm (as in the data).

- The CH: multiplet, 1H around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3: triplet, 3H around 0.9 ppm.

So that fits with the data provided. Let's check:

In the data:

At 0.9 ppm: triplet (3H) → matches CH2CH3.

At 1.7 ppm: multiplet (2H) → matches the CH2 next to benzene.

At 2.9 ppm: multiplet (1H) → matches the CH.

So that fits for the R group being a sec-butyl group.

Additionally, the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would be the -COOH proton, but wait, the -COOH is deprotonated in the NMR if it's in an acid form. Wait no, the singlet at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which suggests it's an -OH group, perhaps from a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid's -OH is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which fits.

Wait, but in benzoic acid, the -COOH is deprotonated when in solution, but maybe in the NMR, if it's in a less acidic environment, it would show. Alternatively, if the solution is not strongly acidic, the -COOH may not be fully deprotonated, leading to a peak around 10.5 ppm. So in that case, the IR's peak at 1720 would be a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which aligns with a carboxylic acid.

So putting it all together, compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That matches with our analysis.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, in this case, X is a benzoic acid. So what reaction occurs?

Wait, no, Clemmensen reduces ketones. But benzoic acid has a carboxylic group. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction of the carbonyl group. Wait, but HI with red phosphorus is also used for the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones and aldehydes, and it forms the corresponding hydrocarbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the reagents mixed up. Red phosphorus and HI is used to reduce alkenes, perhaps. Or maybe it's for the replacement of a hydroxyl group with iodide.

Wait, or perhaps it's the Mitsunobu reaction, but that's for forming ethers. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride or something else.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carbonyl group to perform a reduction. Wait, but in the case of a carboxylic acid, the reaction might be more complex.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible reaction of a benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. HI is a source of H+ and I-.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. The -COOH group could be converted to an iodide. But I don't recall that specific reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is reduced.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps X is a benzophenone, but the NMR doesn't support that. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit that either.

Wait, maybe I should think of the reaction as a replacement of the carbonyl group. For example, if X is a benzophenone, treatment with HI and red phosphorus would reduce the ketone to a methylene group. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid.

Wait, another approach: When a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it forms the corresponding acid iodide. But how?

Wait, I think I might be confusing reactions. Let me think: Red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce carbonyl groups. For a ketone, it would reduce it to an alkane. For an aldehyde, similarly. For a carboxylic acid, perhaps it would reduce the carbonyl to a CH2 group.

Wait, but carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under Clemmensen conditions. Wait, carboxylic acid under strong reducing conditions might form the corresponding CH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH group is replaced with an iodide. For that, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the substitution of an -OH group with an iodide. But in this case, the -OH is part of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the -COOH is converted into a iodide, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the carboxylic acid group but on the substituent. Wait, but substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a hydrogen on the benzene ring. But in that case, the product would have an iodine attached. But the options don't show any iodine.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → has a COOH group and an ethyl in para.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → that's cumene, with isobutyl and methyl.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → same as X.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → a substituent on the benzene.

Wait, but the product after reaction. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an alkyl halide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then after reduction, the COOH group becomes CH2OH or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact product.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. The question asks for the final product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Another approach: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration-oxidation? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the -COOH is converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methylene group. So the COOH (RCOOH) becomes RCH2-. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl-CH2 group. But that doesn't seem to fit any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is the same as X. So the reaction must change X into another structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the carbonyl group but on the substituent. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, maybe the reaction is the removal of the hydroxyl group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution of the -OH, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent R is being modified. For example, the CH2CH(CH2CH3) group might undergo some change.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the reaction.

Another possibility: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a nitrile to produce an amine, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH for an iodide group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group. So the COOH becomes CH2OH? Or CH3? Hmm.

Wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. For a carboxylic acid, maybe it's more like a decarboxylation. Wait, no, not exactly. Or perhaps it's a replacement of the carbonyl O with H.

Wait, for a carboxylic acid, RCOOH, the reduction with HI and P might convert it into RCH2I. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen in the carbonyl is replaced by iodide. So RCOOH → R-C≡I. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack. The -OH in the COOH is a good leaving group under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the -COOH into an acid chloride, but that usually involves SOCl2 or similar reagents, not HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

The options after reaction are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (same as X)

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the benzene ring. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is not a leaving group. Unless the COOH is somehow converted into a better leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternative approach: Perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzene ring's substituent. For example, if the substituent were an alkyne, it would be hydrogenated, but in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not on the substituent but on the aromatic ring. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, but I don't see the conditions favoring that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a coupling of the acid with another molecule, but again, not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but again, not matching the options.

Another approach: What if the reaction is the conversion of the -COOH into a methyl group? For example, if the carbonyl is reduced to a methyl group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D? Because option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Let me check.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4: a sec-butyl and a methyl group.

So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (which has the COOH at position 4), and the reaction reduces the COOH to a CH3 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (since the numbering would place the methyl at position 4 and the sec-butyl at position 1, but I'm not sure about the numbering).

Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH is in position 4, and the substituent is in position 1? No, wait, the substituent is at position 4 as well. Oh, wait, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have the COOH group at position 4 and the sec-butyl group also at position 4? No, wait, wait—para substitution is when substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So in X, the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl in para positions.

So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the structure is:

Positions 1: H, position 4: COOH and sec-butyl. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, actually, in para substitution, the substituents are on opposite carbons. So if one substituent is at position 1, the other is at position 4. So in X, the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl in the para positions.

So if the COOH is at position 1, the sec-butyl is at position 4. Or vice versa.

So when X reacts, if the COOH group is reduced to a methyl group, the product would have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)-toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's option D.

So the reaction reduces the COOH group to a methyl group. How does that happen?

Wait, the reduction of a carboxylic acid to a methyl group requires a strong reducing agent. Red phosphorus and HI might be capable of that. For example, the benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes.

Wait, I think the reaction might be a Barton reduction or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but with HI and red phosphorus, that's less likely.

Wait, another angle: If the -COOH is reduced to a CH2 group, then the product would have a CH2 instead of COOH. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, but option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is cumene. That's a benzene with isopropyl and methyl groups. But our substituent is a sec-butyl, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, but that would require a good leaving group. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. But in that case, the -COOH would need to be an acid chloride, which it isn't.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the reaction part. Let me recap:

X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reaction with red phosphorus and HI → ?

Looking at the options, option C is the same as X. So if X hasn't changed, that can't be the product. So the product must be another structure.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoin condensation isn't applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. But that doesn't make sense with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration. But again, not matching.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is not a benzoic acid but a benzaldehyde. Let me re-examine the NMR data.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is broad, which is more characteristic of a phenol or a carboxylic acid. Benzaldehyde's aldehyde proton appears as a singlet around 9.5-10 ppm, but it's usually a sharp singlet, not a broad one. So the broad singlet suggests -OH, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.

But in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so it's more likely a carboxylic acid than a ketone or ester.

So I think X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Now, the reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to CH2I. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the -OH. But the -OH is part of the carboxylic acid, which is a poor leaving group. So that's unlikely.

Another angle: Maybe X is not a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me think again. If the IR peak at 1720 is from an ester, then the structure would be different.

But in the NMR, we have a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would correspond to an -OH group. Esters don't have an -OH group, so that would suggest that the peak is from a phenol or carboxylic acid.

So, I think X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So, the reaction: X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) → product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, I think I might be missing a key reaction here. Let me think about the possible products in the options.

Looking at option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

But how would X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) become that?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group to CH2, but that would require a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is being modified. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). If under certain conditions, that group is converted into something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the elimination of CO2, converting the COOH group into a CH2 group. But that's more like a decarboxylation, which would need specific conditions, like heating with a base, but I'm not sure with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is reduced to a CH3 group. So RCOOH → RCH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the COOH is reduced to a CH2 group, but that would produce RCH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not indicated.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a coupling where the carboxylic acid forms an ester with HI, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: The reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that usually involves Mg, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the reaction part. Let me try to think of what each option's structure would look like.

Option C is the same as X, so reaction must change X into another structure.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. But I don't see how X would become that.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with substituents isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with substituents sec-butyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction replaces the COOH with a methyl group, then the product would have a methyl and a sec-butyl in para positions. So that would be 4-(sec-butyl)-toluene, which would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

So the reaction reduces the COOH group to a methyl group. How does that happen?

Red phosphorus and HI might be used in a reduction. So perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. But how?

Wait, I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), it is reduced to the corresponding primary alcohol. But in this case, the reagent is HI and red phosphorus, which is a milder reducing agent. I'm not sure if it can reduce a carboxylic acid to a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a two-step process: first, the carboxylic acid is converted to an acid chloride, then reduced. But without Cl in the product, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an iodide, but again, no iodide in the options.

Wait, I'm going to make an educated guess here. Since the reaction uses red phosphorus and HI, which are a reducing agent, and the product needs to be an aromatic compound with a methyl and a sec-butyl group, perhaps the COOH is reduced to a methyl group, giving option D.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C → after reaction, option D.

Wait, but wait. The IR data of X shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is the carbonyl. After reaction, if the COOH is reduced to a CH3, the IR would no longer show that peak. But the options don't have an IR.

But the question is to choose the product structure, regardless of the spectroscopic data after reaction. So, based on the reaction, I think the product would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Compound X is identified based on the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and an O-H stretch in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid. The NMR data further supports this: a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic region (8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H) indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. The remaining signals (2.9 ppm, m, 1H; 1.7 ppm, m, 2H; 1.4 ppm, d, 3H; 0.9 ppm, t, 3H) correspond to a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Thus, X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). This results in the formation of **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, where the benzene ring has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. This matches **Option D**.

**Critical analysis of the options:**
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid):** Does not match the structure of X or its expected product after the reaction.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene):** Incorrect, as the substituent is an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid):** This is the structure of X, not the product after the reaction.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene):** Correct, as it is the product formed after the reduction of the carboxylic acid group in X.
