Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two spatial dimensions, right? Because it's only got dx and dy. So probably, this is a 2-dimensional spacetime or maybe a spatial slice? Or perhaps it's a metric in some other context like a surface embedded in higher dimensions. Not sure yet.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Pseudosphere, oh right, that's a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given might be describing such a surface. I remember that for a pseudosphere, the metric can be written in terms of coordinates, perhaps like Poincaré coordinates or something similar.

Wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic space) is usually written in terms of a parameter like u, or maybe using an exponential function. Like, for example, the metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (du² + dv²) / u², but that's for the hyperbolic plane. But here, the given metric has a denominator of (4 - x² - y²), which is different.

Wait, perhaps this is a conformally flat metric since it's written as a function times dx² + dy². So conformal to the Euclidean metric. For 2D, the area element would be the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. The determinant of a diagonal metric like this (A dx² + B dy²) is AB. So in this case, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the problem is asking for the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. I think the pseudosphere (in 2D) would have an infinite area because it's a surface with negative curvature, right? Like the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. But wait, maybe the radius here comes into play.

Wait, in the metric given, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Hmm, 4 is 2 squared, so perhaps r² where r=2. So that term being (4 - x² - y²) is similar to 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ), which could be like a scaling factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if this metric represents a pseudosphere, then the area would be calculated using the area element I mentioned earlier. But wait, the pseudosphere is a surface, so perhaps I'm integrating over all x and y where the denominator is positive? Because the metric would only be valid where 4 - x² - y² is positive, otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would cause problems.

So the domain of the metric is where 4 - x² - y² >0, which is x² + y² <4. So it's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, if that's the domain, then the area would be the integral over x and y of sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]²? Wait, no, for a 2D metric, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))²? Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] * (dx dy matrix...).

So the components are g_xx = 32/(4-x² - y²), g_yy same as g_xx, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, for a metric in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. But the determinant is already (32/(4-x² - y²))², so sqrt of that is (32/(4 - ... )).

Wait, no, sqrt of (A²) is |A|, so 32/(4 -x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 -x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, if the metric is conformally flat, then the area element is just the square root of the determinant times dx dy. The determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))², so the square root is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, if the domain is x² + y² <4 (since 4 - x² - y² >0), then the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But that integral might diverge. Let me think. Let's switch to polar coordinates. x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. And x² + y² = r². So the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to 2π, r=0 to 2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So factor out constants:

32 * 2π ∫ from 0 to 2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ (-1/2) du/u.

The limits change: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So integral from u=4 to u=0 of (-1/2) du/u.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 → (-1/2)( ln 0 - ln4 ). ln 0 is -infinity, so this becomes (-1/2)(-infinity - ln4) → infinity.

So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So I think the area of the pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic space) is indeed infinite. Because for hyperbolic geometry, each "ball" of radius R has an area proportional to e^{2R}, leading to infinite total area as R approaches infinity. But in this case, the radius is fixed at 2, but the metric's domain is up to r=2 (since denominator goes to zero at r=2). Hmm, wait no, because in hyperbolic space, the radius is a parameter, but here the radius in the denominator is 2.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a 2D surface) of radius r. The metric in some coordinate system might have a term scaling with (r² - x² - y²), but perhaps. Alternatively, the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) could be represented in Poincaré coordinates as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - (r²)/(R²))), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's written differently.

Wait, another approach. The Gaussian curvature K of a 2D metric ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is given by some formula involving the Laplacian of ln f. Specifically, K = - (1/(2 f)) Δ ln f, where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D. So let's compute that for our metric.

Wait, f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²) → let me write f as 32 (4 - r²)^{-1}, where r² = x² + y².

So ln f = ln 32 - ln(4 - r²). The Laplacian of ln f is the Laplacian of ln(4 - r²). Since ln(4 - r²) is a function of r, the Laplacian in 2D is (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr ln(4 - r²)) ). 

So compute that:

d/dr ln(4 - r²) = (-2r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) = (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Then take derivative w.r. to r: d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ].

Let me compute that. Let me call u = r², so expression is (-2 u)/(4 - u).

du/dr = 2r. So derivative is [ (-2 (4 - u) ) - (-2 u)(-1) ] / (4 - u)^2 ) * 2r.

Wait, perhaps better to compute directly:

d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-4 r)(4 - r²) - (-2 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, more accurately, using the quotient rule:

d/dr [ numerator / denominator ] = (num' * denom - num * denom') / denom².

So numerator = -2 r² → num' = -4 r.

Denominator = 4 - r² → denom’ = -2 r.

So putting it together:

[ (-4 r)(4 - r²) - (-2 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify numerator:

(-4 r)(4 - r²) = -16 r +4 r³.

(-2 r²)(-2 r) = 4 r³.

Wait, wait, the second term is subtracted, because of the minus sign in the denominator's derivative? Let me re-do the calculation.

Wait, the formula is [ (num’ * denom) - (num * denom’ ) ] / denom^2.

So num’ is -4r, denom is 4 - r², num is -2 r², denom’ is -2r.

So:

[ (-4r)(4 - r²) - (-2 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Compute each part:

First term: (-4r)(4 - r²) = -16 r +4 r^3.

Second term: (-2 r²)(-2 r) = 4 r^3.

Wait, but wait: it's [ (num’ * denom) - (num * denom’ ) ] → so the second term is (num * denom’ ), which is (-2 r² ) * (-2 r ) = 4 r^3.

So the numerator becomes:

(-16 r +4 r^3) - 4 r^3 = -16 r.

So the Laplacian is (1/r) * [ -16 r ] / (4 - r²)^2 ) → (1/r) * (-16 r ) / ... → -16 / (4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian of ln f is -16/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by - (1/(2 f)) * Laplacian of ln f.

So f is 32/(4 - r²), and Laplacian is -16/(4 - r²)^2.

Thus,

K = - (1/(2 * [32/(4 - r²) ] )) * ( -16 / (4 - r²)^2 )

Simplify:

Negative of 1 over (2*(32/(4-r²)) ) → 1/(64/(4 - r²)) ) = (4 - r²)/64.

Multiply that by -16/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let's compute step by step:

K = - (1/(2 f)) * ( -16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= - [ (1/(2*(32/(4 - r²)) )) ] * ( -16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) ] * ( -16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= (4 - r²)/(64) * 16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= [ (4 - r²) *16 ] / [64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

= 16 / [64 (4 - r²) ) ]

= (1/4) * [1/(4 - r²) ]

Wait, so K = 1/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, but K is the Gaussian curvature. For a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature, this should be constant. But here, it's dependent on r. That's confusing. Did I make a mistake in computation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the metric given isn't a pseudosphere but some other surface. Because the curvature isn't constant, but depends on r.

Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the given metric is indeed that of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, maybe the area is infinite because the integral diverges, as I found earlier.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +∞

So the area must be one of these. The integral for the area I computed led to infinity, so the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the metric is part of a pseudosphere with finite area? No, that doesn't make sense. A pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface of infinite extent, so its area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not for the entire pseudosphere but just a part of it. But the question is about the entire pseudosphere, so the area would be infinite.

Hmm, but wait, in some models, the pseudosphere is represented in a certain coordinate system which only covers a part. For example, the Poincaré disk model covers the entire hyperbolic plane in a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because the metric blows up at the boundary.

So in this case, the area integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy would indeed be infinite. Hence, the area is +infty, so option D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. The problem asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we use the area element derived from the metric. For a conformally flat metric \( ds^2 = f(x, y) (dx^2 + dy^2) \), the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det g = f(x, y)^2 \). Here, \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), so:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of the metric is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must remain positive. To compute the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln u \right]_0^4 = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \ln 4 - \ln 0 \right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 = -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

The options provided are:

- **A)** \( 0 \): Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B)** \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \): Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C)** \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \): Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D)** \( +\infty \): Correct, as the area integral diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
