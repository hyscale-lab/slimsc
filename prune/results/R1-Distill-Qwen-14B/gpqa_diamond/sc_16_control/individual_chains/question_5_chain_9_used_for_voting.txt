Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about eigenvectors of a spin operator, I think. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking for the normalized eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz are involved in calculating spin states. The operator P here is similar to the spin angular momentum operator. So, maybe P is the spin operator for a muon, which has spin-1/2.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. Let me jot those down.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. So that's the Pauli sigma_x matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times the sigma_y matrix, which has [0,-i] in the first row and [i,0] in the second. And Pz is (ħ/2) times sigma_z, which is diagonal with [1,0] and [0,-1].

So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n is given by the vector dot product of n with the vector of these components. So P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz.

But wait, the direction n lies in the x-z plane. That means the y-component is zero. So n is in x-z plane, so n_y =0. So the operator P simplifies to P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Hmm, but wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the general form would be n_x and n_z such that n_x² + n_z² =1, since it's a unit vector.

But wait, the problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n. So perhaps the eigenvector depends on the angles theta and phi, but since n is in the x-z plane, maybe phi is zero or something else.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction n can be represented using theta and phi. But since it's in the x-z plane, that implies that the y-component is zero. The x-z plane corresponds to phi=0 or pi, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is where y=0, so phi is 0 or perhaps pi, depending on the convention.

But maybe I don't need to get into that. Let me think again.

The eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the operator P acting on the eigenvector |v> gives (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component along any direction are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalue here is positive, so it's the spin-up state along the direction n.

To find the eigenvector, I think I need to write the matrix for P and then find its eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Because for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvectors can be written in terms of the direction of spin quantization. The general form is something like cos(theta/2) in the first component and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) in the second component, but that depends on the direction.

Wait, let me think. The eigenvectors for spin along direction (theta, phi) are given by:

|+> = [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]^T

Similarly, the |- > state is [ -i sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T or something like that.

But in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, which means that phi is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0, because phi is measured from the x-axis. So, if I'm right, the eigenvector would have e^{i phi} = 1, because phi=0.

So the eigenvector would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. But wait, I'm not sure about the phase factor. Alternatively, since phi is zero, maybe it's just [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But wait, let me think about the matrix for P. The operator P is n_x Px + n_z Pz. Let's write that out.

Px is (ħ/2) [[0 1],[1 0]], Py is (ħ/2)[[0 -i],[i 0]], but since n_y=0, we don't have Py here. So for P, we have n_x times [[0,1],[1,0]] plus n_z times [[1,0],[0,-1]], all multiplied by ħ/2.

So P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, because:

n_x * [[0, 1],[1,0]] gives the off-diagonal elements as n_x in both positions.

n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] gives the diagonal elements as n_z and -n_z.

So putting it together, the matrix is:

[[n_z*(ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2)], 
[(n_x ħ/2), (-n_z ħ/2)] ]

Wait, no, that's only if we're considering the operators multiplied by their respective factors. Wait, no, n_x is a scalar, so when we multiply the matrix, each element is multiplied by n_x or n_z.

Wait, let me re-do that. Each term in the matrix is multiplied by the respective component.

Wait, Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when n_x is multiplied, it's (n_x * (ħ/2)) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly, Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by n_z, it's (n_z * (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So adding them together, P is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z *1, n_x *1], [n_x *1, (-n_z) *1] ]

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix P is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix with elements [n_z, n_x; n_x, -n_z].

We are looking for the eigenvector |v> such that P|v> = (+ħ/2)|v>.

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), so:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rewrite these equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Hmm, I can write this as a system of linear equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b =0

n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b =0

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. So the determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero.

The coefficient matrix is:

[ (n_z - 1)   n_x ]

[ n_x        (-n_z -1) ]

The determinant is [ (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) ) - (n_x^2) ] = 0.

Let me compute this determinant:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) ) = (-n_z^2 + 1 )

So determinant becomes (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 =0

Which implies (1 -n_z^2) -n_x^2 =0 → 1 = n_z^2 +n_x^2.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1. So this condition is satisfied, which indicates that the equations are consistent and there's a non-trivial solution. So the eigenvectors exist.

Now, let's find the eigenvector. Let's pick equation 1:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ (-n_x) / (n_z -1) ] b.

Let me express a in terms of b. Let me factor out:

Let me write a = k * b, where k is a constant.

So from equation 1: (n_z -1) k + n_x =0 → k = -n_x / (n_z -1 )

Wait, that's substituting a =k b into equation 1.

Wait, equation 1 is (n_z-1)a +n_x b =0 → (n_z-1)(k b) +n_x b =0 → [ (n_z-1)k +n_x ] b =0.

Since b is not zero (non-trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

So (n_z -1)k +n_x =0 → k = (-n_x)/(n_z -1 )

Hmm, perhaps another approach is better. Let me suppose that the eigenvector has components [a, b]^T. Let's express a in terms of b from equation 1.

From equation 1: a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Similarly, equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → substitute a from equation 1:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b =0 → [ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] b =0.

Since b isn't zero, the term in brackets must be zero:

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] =0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ) =0.

Let me compute (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ) = (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z-1) ) = (-n_z^2 +n_z) -n_z +1 )= (-n_z^2 +n_z -n_z +1 )= (-n_z^2 +1 ).

So the equation becomes:

- n_x^2 + (-n_z^2 +1) )=0 → -n_x^2 -n_z^2 +1=0 → n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, which holds true because n is a unit vector.

So, this doesn't give any new information. So, I can express a in terms of b.

Now, the eigenvector is [a, b] = [k b, b] where k = (-n_x)/(n_z -1).

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to parametrize n in terms of an angle theta. Since n is in the x-z plane, let's define it as n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

Wait, normally in spherical coordinates, a point on the unit sphere can be written as (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta)), but since phi=0 (since in x-z plane), then n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, but wait, in standard terms, when phi=0, the point is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), but perhaps sometimes theta is measured from the z-axis. So, in that case, yes.

So, substituting n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So, let's plug these into a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

So, a = [ - sin(theta) / (cos(theta) -1) ] b.

Hmm, cos(theta) -1 = -2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, let's compute this:

a = [ - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ - 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] * b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels.

So, [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2).

So, let me write a = cot(theta/2) b.

So, the eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) b, b ].

We can factor out b and write in terms of a parameter, say, let b=1 (or any non-zero constant), then a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but the eigenvectors are defined up to a multiplicative constant, so we can choose b=1 for simplicity.

So, the eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, cot(theta/2) can be written as cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So, the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ].

To normalize, we need to ensure that the sum of the squares of the components equals 1.

Compute the normalization factor:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ (cos^2(theta/2) )/ sin^2(theta/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] / sin^2(theta/2 ) ) = 1 / sin^2(theta/2 )

So, the normalization factor is sqrt( sin^2(theta/2) ) = |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is an angle between 0 and pi (as it's a unit vector in x-z), sin(theta/2) is positive, so we can write it as sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) / (1/sin(theta/2)), 1 / (1/sin(theta/2)) ) ].

Wait, that's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because:

The first component is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by sin(theta/2) (the normalization factor), which gives cos(theta/2).

The second component is 1 multiplied by sin(theta/2), giving sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but this is getting me a vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and option D has some sqrt factors multiplied by hbar, but I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector components. Because eigenvectors are dimensionless; the operator has units of ħ, so the eigenvector is just a direction.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

But wait, in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane, so e^{i phi} would be 1, making option B's second component sin(theta).

Wait, but the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which matches option C.

But let me look at the other options.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar multiplied by sin(theta/2). But eigenvectors have no units, so hbar shouldn't be there. So D is likely incorrect.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar, but again, units don't make sense for a normalized vector. So probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). Since phi=0, it's (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which is the polar form of a point on the unit circle, but for spin-1/2, the eigenvectors are more like (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). So option B's form is for theta being twice the angle we usually have in spin states.

So, the correct option would be C, which matches [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but another thought: the operator P is in the direction n, so the eigenstate is |+n>, which is written as [ cos(theta_n/2), e^{i phi_n} sin(theta_n/2) ]^T, where theta_n is the polar angle of n, and phi_n is the azimuthal angle.

Since n is in x-z plane, phi_n=0, so e^{i phi_n}=1.

So, components are [ cos(theta_n/2), sin(theta_n/2) ]^T.

Which is exactly option C.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we analyze the problem as follows:

The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$, where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given in terms of $2 \times 2$ matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and the operator simplifies to $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting the given components, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation $\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$ leads to the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \\
n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

Here, $|v\rangle = [a, b]^T$ is the eigenvector. Solving these equations, we find that $a/b = \cot(\theta/2)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle defining the direction $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ in the x-z plane.

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we verify that the components satisfy the condition $|\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1$, confirming that the vector is already normalized.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors. Hence, this is incorrect.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This form corresponds to a different parametrization, typically used for spherical coordinates, but it does not match the eigenvector derived for spin-1/2 systems. Additionally, $\phi = 0$ for $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, making this option unsuitable.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector exactly. It is consistent with the spin-1/2 formalism and the normalization condition.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  Similar to Option A, this includes $\hbar$, which is not part of the normalized eigenvector. Thus, this is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
