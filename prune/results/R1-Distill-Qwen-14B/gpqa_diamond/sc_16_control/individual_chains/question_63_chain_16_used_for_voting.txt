Okay, I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

So the question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They use the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a bit more advanced than the rigid rotor model because it accounts for the bond's possible stretching. Oh right, the rigid rotor assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally excited) one allows for changes. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. For a diatomic, this would be the ground state with the lowest possible vibrational and rotational energy levels. But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm thinking that the next state must involve either a change in vibrational or rotational energy, or maybe both. But the problem specifies the lowest possible energy increase, so perhaps it's the first excited state in either vibration or rotation.

Wait, the options are about the momentum of a photon. So the molecule absorbs a photon, and this causes a transition to the next state. I need to find the photon's momentum. Momentum p is related to the photon's energy and wavelength. Remember that the momentum p = E/c, where E is the energy and c is the speed of light. But maybe I'll get to that later.

The problem gives me Mx (mass of X) as 20 amu, My as 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

So, what's the next state? The fundamental state is the lowest, which is the first vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I think. Wait, no. Actually, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have both vibrational and rotational contributions. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be either n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). Which of these requires less energy? Because the question asks for the photon with the lowest possible energy, which would correspond to the smallest energy transition.

Wait, the problem says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so the next state in terms of the lowest total energy. Or, perhaps, the transition with the least energy. So I'm thinking that the vibrational energy levels are quantized and have higher spacing than rotational ones. Because for a typical diatomic, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational. So the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher state would require either a vibrational or rotational change. Which one has a lower energy difference?

Let me think: the energy of a photon is E = hν = ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The energy spacing for a vibrational transition (from n=0 to n=1) would be ΔE_vib = hω. For rotational transitions, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ΔE_rot = (ħ² / (2μ R²)) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J-1) ) ] / something. Wait, perhaps I should recall the rotational energy formula. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2μ R²)) J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = [ (ħ²/(2μ R²)) (1*2) ] - [0] = (ħ²/(2μ R²)) * 2 = ħ²/(μ R²).

Hmm, so the vibrational transition energy is hω. Which is bigger, hω or ħ²/(μ R²)? Let's compute both.

Given:
h = Planck's constant ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s
ω = 4e14 rad/s
μ (reduced mass) = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) ≈ 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert μ to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.015, so 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So calculate ħ²/(μ R²). Let's see:

ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

μ R squared is (3.015e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/(μ R²) = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ approx 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the unit would be J, correct. Now, compare this with hω. 

hω = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

So hω is about 2.65e-19 J, whereas the rotational energy difference is about 9.21e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires a lot less energy. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next state would be the one where J=1, because that would require a lower energy photon.

Wait, but wait. Because in quantum mechanics, transitions are governed by selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So J can go from 0 to 1. But wait, is this allowed in the vibration-rotation model? Because in pure rotational transitions, yes, but in the vibration-rotation model, it's possible to have rotational transitions accompanied by vibrational changes. Hmm, but the question is about the lowest possible energy change. So the photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that causes the least energy increase. So if the rotational transition requires 9.21e-23 J and the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J, the rotational change is much smaller. So the photon would be for the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' Hmm. Or perhaps, the next state is the one with the next higher energy, but the smallest possible increment. So, which transition gives the smallest energy difference?

Yes, so the rotational transition is smaller. So the photon's energy is the rotational energy difference. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state could be either J=1 (v=0) or v=1 (J=0). The energy of the first is lower, so the photon needed would have lower energy. So the molecule would preferentially absorb that photon.

But wait, in the real world, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones. So perhaps the first transition is the rotational one, but in the question, the given options are all in the ballpark of 1e-27 kg·m/s or so, which is a momentum of 1e-27 Ns.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. The question is about the photon's momentum. So the energy of the photon is E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light (3e8 m/s). So p = E/(c).

So if I find the energy of the photon needed, I can compute p.

Earlier, I thought that the rotational transition requires E_rot = ħ²/(μ R²) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So p_rot = E_rot / c ≈ 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. That's four orders of magnitude higher. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Let me re-calculate the rotational energy difference.

E_rot = (ħ²/(2μ R²)) [ J (J+1) - (J-1) J ] for ΔJ=1. Wait, no, when J goes from 0 to 1, the energy goes from 0 (E0 = 0) to E1 = ħ²/(2μ R²) * (1)(2) ) = 2 ħ²/(2 μ R²) ) = ħ²/(μ R²).

Wait, I think I got that right earlier. So E_rot = ħ²/( μ R² )

So let's recompute that.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So E_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.206e-46) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So p_rot = E_rot / c = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But the options are much larger, like 1e-27. Hmm. So 3e-31 is way smaller than 1e-27. So maybe I'm wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a vibrational transition. Let's compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = h ω = 6.626e-34 Js *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

p_vib = E_vib / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s. Hmm, that's about 8.8e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is smaller than that. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is close. Hmm, but 8.8e-28 isn't among the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27
C) 1.1e-27
D)1.4e-28

Wait, 8.8e-28 is about ten times larger than option D. So none of the options exactly match. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations. Let's compute E_vib again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.
ω =4e14 rad/s.
E = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s. So approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. None of the options match exactly. But wait, perhaps the model considers the next state as a change in both vibration and rotation, leading to a transition with higher energy. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the energy levels.

Wait, another thought: in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state could be n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. But which of these has the lower energy? Since the vibrational energy spacing is much larger than the rotational, the n=1 transition would require a higher energy photon than the J=1 transition. So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon in the rotational transition.

But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition's photon has a momentum of ~3e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than the options given. The vibrational photon's momentum is about 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which isn't exactly an option, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But that's getting complicated, and I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I confused the energy units. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the state that is the next higher in energy. So I need to find the transition with the smallest energy difference.

So the vibrational transition's energy is 2.65e-19 J, and the rotational transition's energy is 9.21e-23 J. So the rotational transition is much smaller, so the photon for that would have lower energy. But in the options, the momenta are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. But my calculation gives the rotational photon momentum as 3e-31, which is four orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest option.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula for the rotational energy. Let me rederive the formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ²/(2μ R²)) J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = (ħ²/(2μ R²)) (1*2 - 0) ) = (ħ²/(2μ R²)) * 2 = ħ²/(μ R²). So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact numbers instead of approximations.

Let me compute μ more accurately.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.8181818 amu.

Convert μ to kg:

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.8181818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute 1.8181818 * 1.66053906660e-27:

1.8181818 * 1.66053906660 ≈ approximately 3.015e0 (wait 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.015, yes). So 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 *1e-68 = approximately 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So E_rot = ħ²/(μ R²) = (1.112e-68) / (1.206e-46) = 9.22e-23 J.

So p_rot = E_rot / c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, that's 3.07e-31 Ns. None of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, and the calculation I did was correct, but perhaps the given options have a typo or I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck E_vib.

E_vib = hω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p_vib = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is option D (1.4e-28), which is about an order of magnitude smaller. Hmm. Did I perhaps mess up the calculation? Let me compute 2.65e-19 /3e8.

3e8 is 3 *1e8 = 3e8.

2.65e-19 / 3e8 = (2.65/3) * 1e-27 = approximately 0.883 * 1e-27 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

So 8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the next state which is the first state higher in energy, regardless of whether it's vibration or rotation. But which transition is allowed? Because sometimes, in molecules, certain transitions are allowed based on selection rules.

The selection rules for vibrational transitions usually require Δv = ±1. For rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1, but they can only happen if there's a simultaneous vibrational change (Δv = ±1), or in pure rotation, but I think in pure rotational transitions, the vibrational state must remain the same. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, a photon can cause a transition that changes both vibrational and rotational states. For example, a photon can cause a vibrational transition (Δv=±1) and a rotational transition (ΔJ=±1). So the energy of the photon would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy differences.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), then the next possible state could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1) or even (v=1, J=1). But the energy required for (v=1, J=0) is E_vib (2.65e-19 J), while for (v=0, J=1) it's E_rot (9.22e-23 J). So the minimal energy is E_rot, but according to the selection rules, can the molecule undergo a pure rotational transition without a vibrational change?

Wait, the selection rules for pure rotation in diatomic molecules usually require that the vibrational quantum number remains the same, Δv=0. But in the presence of a vibration-rotation coupling, perhaps a vibrational transition can accompany a rotational transition.

Wait, another thought: the selection rule for vibrational transitions (infrared) is Δv=±1, and for rotational transitions in microwave spectra, it's ΔJ=±1 with Δv=0. But for a photon causing a transition that changes both vibrational and rotational states, perhaps that's allowed. But I'm not certain about that.

In any case, the question is about the photon's momentum that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy transition would be the rotational one.

But according to the calculations, the rotational photon's momentum is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state (n=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1), but including a change in rotational state. But that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy levels as a combination of both. The total energy is E_total = E_vib + E_rot. The ground state is (n=0, J=0) with E=0. The next state could be (n=1, J=0), which would have E=E_vib. Or (n=0, J=1), E=E_rot. Or (n=1, J=1) which would have E=E_vib + E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = E_vib + (something).

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the smallest ΔE. So (n=0, J=1) is lower than (n=1, J=0), as E_rot is smaller than E_vib. So the photon needed would be for the rotational transition.

But then, the problem's options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps using R in different units. Oh wait, R is given in angstroms, but I used 2e-10 meters, which is correct. Because 1 angstrom = 1e-10 meters. So that's right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model used is the rigid rotor model, which assumes fixed bond length. Wait, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So bond length R can change, but for the purpose of these calculations, perhaps R is treated as fixed. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational energy is being considered, and that the rotational energy is part of the same transition.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of considering the rotational energy, the question is about the vibrational energy.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state usually refers to the ground state, which is the lowest energy state. So in that case, the next state would be the first excited state. But the first excited state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute both the energy differences and see which photon momentum is required.

In my earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum ~3e-31 kg m/s, and the vibrational transition requires ~8.8e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options match these. So perhaps the question is considering the transition from the rotational ground state to the next rotational state, but the molecule is vibrating as well. Or perhaps it's considering the transition as a vibrational transition with the same J state.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy again, but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition to the first excited vibrational state, which requires a photon of momentum 8.8e-28 kg m/s. But the options don't include that.

Looking at the options, they are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me recompute E_rot more precisely.

Wait, E_rot = ħ²/(μ R²).

Let me compute each term.

ħ = h/(2π) = 6.62607015e-34 J·s / (2 * 3.1415926535) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So 20 *2 =40, 20+2=22, so 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.8181818 amu.

μ = 1.8181818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = let me compute 1.8181818 *1.66053906660.

1.81818 *1.660539 = let me compute:

1.8 *1.6605 is about 2.9889. 0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.0302. So total around 2.9889 + 0.0302 = 3.0191. So μ ≈3.0191e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

So R² =4e-20 m².

μ R² =3.0191e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.20764e-46 kg m².

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.1120008e-68 (J·s)^2.

So E_rot = ħ²/(μ R²) = (1.1120008e-68) / (1.20764e-46) = 9.207e-23 J.

So p_rot = E_rot / c = 9.207e-23 /3e8 = 3.069e-31 kg m/s. Still way too small.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which requires a photon of momentum about 8.8e-28 kg m/s. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but let's think again.

Wait, the problem statement says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which implies that both rotational and vibrational energies are considered. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next state could be (n=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition, but the energy is lower than a vibrational transition (n=1, J=0). So the photon for the rotational transition is needed.

But according to the calculations, the momentum is way too small. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, which assumes fixed bond length. But the given question says it's the rotation-vibration model, which is non-rigid. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses R in a different way, but I think I used it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational angular frequency. Because sometimes, the rotational constant is related to the vibrational frequency.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by ħ/(2μ R² c), perhaps? Or another formula.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by (h/(8π² μ c R²)).

Wait, let me compute B first.

B = (h)/(8 π² μ R² c). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the rotational constant B is given by (h/(8 π² μ R²)).

Wait, perhaps the formula for rotational constant is B = (h/(8 π² μ R²)).

Let me compute that.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

8 π² ≈ 78.9568352.

μ is 3.0191e-27 kg.

R² =4e-20 m².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (78.9568352 * 3.0191e-27 *4e-20 )

Calculate denominator: 78.9568352 *3.0191e-27 = appr 78.9568 *3.0191 = about 238.576e-27.

Multiply by 4e-20: 238.576e-27 *4e-20 = 954.3e-47 = 9.543e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 / 9.543e-45 ≈ 6.94e10 1/s.

Wait, but perhaps the rotational constant is expressed in cm^-1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy difference in terms of B.

The rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = B (1*2) - B (0*1) )= 2 B.

So E_rot = 2 B.

So with B ≈6.94e10 1/s, E_rot = 2 *6.94e10 Hz.

Wait, 6.94e10 Hz is a frequency. Energy E= h * frequency.

So E_rot = h * 2*6.94e10 = 6.626e-34 * 1.388e11 = approx 9.23e-23 J. Same as before.

So the same calculation. So p_rot is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all about 1e-27, so perhaps the problem is considering a different process. Maybe the photon is causing a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes, but that would require the sum of both energies. But that would make the energy even larger, so the momentum would be larger than 8.8e-28, which again doesn't fit any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental vibrational state to the next vibrational state, regardless of rotation, so it's a purely vibrational transition.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have this, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. That's about a fifth of my calculated 8.8e-28. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the units of R. Oh wait, R is given in angstroms. Did I convert it correctly?

Yes, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the model. Let me think. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, sometimes the vibrational energy is considered along with rotational, and the energy levels are a combination. But in that case, the first excited state is a combination of both, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which is (v=1, J=1), but that would require both a vibrational and a rotational transition. The energy would be the sum of the two.

E_total = E_vib + (E_rot from J=1 - J=0 )= 2.65e-19 J + 9.22e-23 J ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

So the momentum would be p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s. Again, same as before.

Hmm. None of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the selection rules for vibrational transitions, which require a change in the vibrational state. So the molecule can only absorb a photon that causes a vibrational transition, possibly without changing the rotational state. Wait, but the question says the molecule 'switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy'. If the next state is a vibrational excitation (n=1, J=0), then the energy is higher than a rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the photon must cause a transition that changes both states, but I don't have enough information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach and expects the use of the vibrational energy only. Then the answer would be 8.8e-28 kg m/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is not about the quantum rotation-vibration model but the simple vibration model. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational energy.

p = E_vib / c = 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the problem intended to use the rotational transition, but the given options are wrong.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm. Maybe I should recompute E_vib but perhaps I used the wrong frequency. Wait, the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the frequency ν = ω/(2π) ≈ 4e14 /6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

Wait, that's different. Because E_vib = h ν, not h ω.

Wait a big mistake here! Oh no, I think I messed that up. The energy is E = h ν, where ν is the frequency in Hz (s^-1). But the given value is ω=4e14 rad/s. So ν = ω/(2π) ≈4e14 /6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So then E_vib = h * ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.222e-20 J.

Then, p_vib =4.222e-20 /3e8 ≈1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Ah, that's option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by using ω as the frequency instead of converting it to ν. Because in the formula E = hν, ν is in Hz, which is cycles per second, whereas ω is in radians per second.

So the correct calculation is:

ν = ω/(2π) =4e14 / (2 *3.1416) ≈4e14 /6.283 ≈6.366e13 Hz.

E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.222e-20 J.

p_vib = E_vib /c =4.222e-20 /3e8 ≈1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Which matches option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences associated with vibrational and rotational transitions. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, and the fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy is either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Since the vibrational energy spacing is much larger than the rotational energy spacing, the rotational transition requires less energy.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu R^2} J(J+1)
   \]
   The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{\mu R^2}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   - \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
   - \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)

   Compute \( \mu R^2 \):
   \[
   \mu R^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]
   Compute \( \hbar^2 \):
   \[
   \hbar^2 = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 1.112 \times 10^{-68} \, \text{J}^2\text{s}^2
   \]
   Compute \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{\mu R^2} = \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The momentum of the photon for the rotational transition is:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]
   This value is far smaller than any of the given options, so the rotational transition is not the correct choice.

2. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   The vibrational energy spacing is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu
   \]
   where \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \) is the frequency in Hz. Substituting the given values:
   - \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
   - \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{6.283} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz} \)
   - \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)

   Compute \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.222 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.222 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]
   This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The photon momentum required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy is \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), corresponding to the vibrational transition.
