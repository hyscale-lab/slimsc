Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Two astronauts with different masses are moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and total energy. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativity of velocity. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula for relativity.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, wait, I should check the direction. Both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed will be the difference between their speeds divided by that factor. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait no, actually, the problem says "relative speed" between them. So I think I should compute the relative velocity of one with respect to the other. Let me recall the formula correctly. So if A is moving at v and B at u, both in the same direction, then the relative speed as seen from A would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, wait, no, that depends on the frame. Let me think again. The formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, but sometimes I get confused about which one is subtracted from which.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula correctly. Let me think of it as: from the perspective of the first astronaut (say, the one moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c in the same direction). Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, the relative speed depends on the frame. But the question just asks for the relative speed, regardless of direction, so maybe it's the magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the relative velocity using the formula. Let me assign u as 0.6c (Astronaut A) and v as 0.5c (Astronaut B). So from A's frame, what is B's velocity? The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). So plugging in, (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: -0.1 c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the speed is (-0.1 c)/(0.7) = -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since they are moving in the same direction, from A's frame, B is moving slower. So the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that would be one of the options. Checking the options, option C and D have v_rel=0.14c.

So now the next part is the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but wait, the total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each has their own relativistic energy.

The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding these together: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So the total energy is about 5.96 m c², which matches option C: E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, but what about the rest mass energy? Wait, the rest energy is m c². But for each astronaut, their rest mass is 2m and 3m, so their rest energies are 2m c² and 3m c². But when they are moving, their total energy includes their kinetic plus rest energy.

So the calculations I did before correctly include their rest energies. So the total energy is indeed around 5.96 mc².

Putting it together: the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
