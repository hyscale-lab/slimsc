Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me think through it step by step.

The problem states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, we have to consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with momenta that cancel each other out.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, right? Or at least, for these purposes, we can consider it as such because its mass is negligible. So the muon would have some kinetic energy and the neutrino would carry away some energy as well.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's stationary. So, E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass energy, plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is all kinetic since it's massless.

So, E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

But energy is conserved, so E_final = E_initial. Therefore, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy E_mu is m_mu c² + K_mu, where K_mu is its kinetic energy. So substituting, E_final becomes (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu = 139.6.

So, 105.7 + K_mu + E_nu = 139.6 → K_mu + E_nu = 33.9 MeV.

Now, considering momentum conservation. The initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must cancel. Let me denote the magnitudes. Let's say the muon has momentum p, and the neutrino has momentum p as well, but in the opposite direction.

The muon's energy is the total energy, which is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units might be a bit tricky here. Alternatively, using natural units where c=1, so E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So for the muon: E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2).

The neutrino's energy is just p, since it's massless.

So, the total energy equation becomes:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, now I need to solve for p. Let's write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Squaring both sides:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p².

So, p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p + p².

Cancel p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p.

Let me compute the squares:

105.7^2 is approximately, let's calculate that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms are 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 ≈ (100 +5.7)^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49=11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: 140^2 is 19600, subtract 0.4*(2*139.6 +0.4) → wait, perhaps better to compute it directly.

139.6 * 139.6: Let's see, 140*140=19600. Subtract 0.4 * (139.6 +140) * 2? Wait, maybe a better approach. Alternatively, 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So (140 -0.4)^2 =140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4² =19600 - 112 + 0.16=19488.16.

So, substituting into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Rearranging:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2:

Hmm, 279.2 * 29.8 is about 279.2 *30=8376, but that's a bit higher. Let's compute 29.8 *279.2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 279.2 * 29 = (280-0.8)*29=280*29=8120, minus 0.8*29=23.2 → 8120-23.2=8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Alternatively, using calculator steps:

8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's approximate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is more than 8315.67. So 30 gives 8376, which is 8376-8315.67=60.33 too much.

So, it's 30 minus (60.33 /279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 → 29.784.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p (since E=p for massless particles). So E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt(29.784^2 +105.7^2).

Compute 29.784^2: approximately 29.784 squared. 30^2 is 900, so 29.784^2 is about (30-0.216)^2=30² - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2=900 -12.96 +0.046656≈887.0866.

105.7^2 is 11172.49, as earlier.

So sqrt(887.0866 +11172.49)=sqrt(12059.5766)= approximately 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy is 109.81 MeV, which would make its kinetic energy K_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

So the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculated values.

So the correct option is D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of a stationary positive pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a positive muon (\( \mu^+ \)) and a neutrino (\( \nu \)). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
\]
Since energy is conserved, \( E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}} \). The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} = 105.7 + K_{\mu^+}.
\]
The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic since its mass is negligible:
\[
E_\nu = K_\nu.
\]
Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
105.7 + K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 139.6.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
The pion is initially at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of the muon's momentum be \( p \), and the neutrino's momentum is also \( p \) (since it is massless). The muon's total energy is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} = 105.7 + K_{\mu^+} \), we get:
\[
105.7 + K_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
The neutrino's energy is \( E_\nu = p \), so the total energy equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \( p^2 \) from both sides:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p.
\]
Substituting \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \) and \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \):
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot p.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
279.2 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Finding Kinetic Energies
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating \( 29.78^2 \approx 887.09 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
