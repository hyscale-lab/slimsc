Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think they're asking for the number density or something like that. Like, how many stars are there per unit distance, as you move further out.

Let me get this straight. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5? But wait, the question is asking how N changes with distance. Does that mean the derivative of N with respect to d? Or is it a change in N per unit distance?

Wait, the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe I should think in terms of differential number. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr at distance r. So that would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell, but wait, no, because the number is given as varying with plx, which is 1/d.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with r (distance). So if N increases with r^5, then with each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. But wait, that's the N as a function of r. But the question is about the change per unit range of distance. Hmm, maybe it's about the gradient, the rate of change. So dN/dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N = k * r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in N per unit change in r would be proportional to r^4. Wait, but that would make the option C, which is r^4, the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's not about the derivative but about the number in a shell. Let me consider that.

In a shell between r and r + dr, the volume is 4πr² dr. But wait, this is a solid angle, but the question is about a specific region of the sky, so maybe it's a fixed area. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up the way number counts work in the universe.

Wait, the number of stars you can see in a certain direction (like in a specific region) depends on the density and the volume along that line of sight. But in this problem, they're giving a specific relation between N and parallax. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, N = k * d^5.

But how does this translate to the number per unit distance? Well, if you think of N as the total number of stars within a certain distance, then the number per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d. But wait, in the question, N is the number of stars varying with plx as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N is the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of stars per unit area in the sky, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's break it down. The number of stars observed in a region of the sky as a function of parallax. Parallax is 1/distance. So if you have more stars at a larger distance, that's because the number increases with distance.

Wait, wait. Let's think of flux or density. Suppose the number density of stars is n(r) = some function. If N is the number of stars in a volume V, then N = n(r) * V. But the actual relation given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝d^5. So N increases rapidly with distance.

But the question is about how N changes with distance per unit range. So, if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N for a small change dr would be approximately dN = 5k d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be C.

But wait, let me think again about the setup. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / (plx)^5 = k d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. So for each unit increase in distance, the number increases by r^5. But the question asks how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps the number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5 k r^4. Hence, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking the functional form of N versus r, but the wording says "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So that would imply dN/dr, which would be 5k r^4, so proportional to r^4. So the answer is C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~r^4. So that's the correct answer.

The question asks how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(d\)), we can write \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\(r\)), we interpret this as the rate of change of \(N\) with respect to \(r\), or \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). If \( N = k \cdot r^5 \), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = 5k \cdot r^4
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
