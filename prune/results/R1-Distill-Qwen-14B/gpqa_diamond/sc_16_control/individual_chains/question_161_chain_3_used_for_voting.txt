Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The reason for doing this is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment to get better electron microscopy results. But even with that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the compartment. But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't the same as λ1. The temperature is the same, so that's not changing. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path of gas molecules is influenced by the pressure. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. 

In this case, the vacuum is very high (ultra-high), so the pressure is low. Initially, the mean free path would be λ1. But when the electron beam is on, what changes? Well, the electron beam is a source of energy. The electrons have high energy because of the 1000 kV accelerating voltage. When the electrons hit the gas molecules, they might cause ionization or excitation of the gas particles.

Wait, so the gas molecules might become charged. If they are ionized, their behavior changes. Neutral gas molecules would have a different mean free path compared to charged ones. But how does that affect the mean free path?

I recall that charged particles (like ions) would interact differently with the electric fields, perhaps. But wait, the electron beam itself is moving, so maybe the ions are accelerated or something.

Alternatively, another factor is that when gas molecules are ionized, they might gain charge, which affects their scattering from the electron beam. But does that affect the overall mean free path in the chamber?

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. If the gas is now ionized, perhaps the effective cross-section (d²) for collisions changes. But wait, the formula uses d, the diameter. If the molecules are charged, maybe they have a larger effective diameter because they can interact with each other through electrostatic forces, not just via collisions.

So if the cross-section increases (d² is effectively larger), then the mean free path would decrease. Because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases (because of charge), λ decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, I should think again. Mean free path is about the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the number of collisions increases, the mean free path is shorter. So if the gas becomes ionized, the effective collision cross-section might increase. That would mean more frequent collisions, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So λ2 would be less than λ1. So the correct answer would be option C, λ2 < λ1.

But wait, what's the exact process when the electron beam is on? The electron beam is generating X-rays when it interacts with the sample, right? Or maybe the gas molecules are bombarded by the electrons. This could cause them to ionize, creating ions and electrons in the compartment.

But how does that affect the number of gas molecules? Well, if the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum, there's not many gas molecules, so the electron beam might cause them to be ionized, but I don't think that would change the number of gas particles significantly. The mass spectrometer detected some gas, so maybe ionization isn't removing them but just changing their charge state.

Another angle: the presence of the electron beam itself could cause the gas to become partially ionized. When a gas is partially ionized, the mean free path changes. Oh, wait, in a plasma, the mean free path is much longer because the primary interactions are between electrons and ions rather than neutral molecules. But wait, in a plasma, the electron mean free path is longer, but the gas here is not fully ionized. Or does the situation here create a plasma?

Wait, the electron beam has a high energy, so the gas might become a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the charged particles might move more freely, but wait, the mean free path for neutral gas would be λ1. But if the gas is ionized, perhaps the neutral molecules are less, and the charged particles have a longer mean free path. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, no. The mean free path for the gas molecules (the neutral ones) would be affected by other factors. If the gas is partially ionized, the neutral molecules might have a longer mean free path because there are fewer neutral molecules to collide with. Wait, no. If some molecules are ionized, they might not collide as much as neutral ones. So the remaining neutral gas molecules would have a lower number density, which would increase the mean free path.

Wait, the mean free path λ = 1/(√2 * n * d²), where n is the number density. If the number of neutral molecules decreases because some are ionized (thus not contributing to neutral collisions), then n decreases. So 1/(n) increases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. Then, this would mean λ2 > λ1, so the correct option would be A, since λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the mean free path would decrease. Hmm. So perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong.

Let me think again. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the number density of the gas. If some gas molecules are ionized (assuming they don't contribute to the collisions between neutral molecules), then the effective number density of neutral molecules decreases. So λ increases because n decreases.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1. Then, looking at the options:

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Option C says λ2 < λ1.

So which is correct?

Wait, but the presence of the electron beam changes the gas in another way. The beam's electrons might cause the gas molecules to be bombarded, leading to more collisions, which would decrease the mean free path. Or perhaps it's the other way.

Alternatively, the presence of charged particles (ions) in the chamber would cause them to interact with the electron beam, but that's perhaps more about electron scattering rather than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.

Wait, no. The mean free path Mike is measuring is of the gas molecules, not the electrons. So the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path in the presence of the electron beam.

Wait, but the electron beam's presence might affect the gas in different ways. Let's think: when the electron beam is off, we have a certain number of gas molecules, and their mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the electrons interact with the gas. The electrons have a much higher energy, so they can ionize the gas molecules.

So the gas is being ionized. Let's say that in the presence of the beam, a fraction f of the gas molecules get ionized. Then, the number of neutral gas molecules would be (1-f) times the original number. So n' = (1-f) * n.

The mean free path would then be λ2 = λ1 / (1-f).

Since f is positive (some ionization occurs), (1-f) <1, so λ2 > λ1.

So λ2 is larger than λ1. So the mean free path increases.

But wait, in reality, when a gas is partially ionized, the neutral species are fewer, so their number density is lower. Thus, their mean free path increases.

So in this case, λ2 would be greater than λ1, so λ2 >= 1.22 λ1? Or could it be any amount greater than λ1?

Looking back at the options, option A is λ2 >=1.22λ1, option C is λ2 <λ1.

Hmm. So the question is, does the ionization cause the mean free path to increase or decrease.

Wait, another angle: the gas in the ultra-high vacuum is at very low pressure, so the mean free path is already large. When the electron beam is applied, the gas becomes partially ionized. The ions and electrons would have their own dynamics, but for the neutral gas molecules, their number density is lower, so their mean free path increases.

So λ2 > λ1. So the correct option is A, since λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.

Wait, but why 1.22? Hmm. I think 1.22 might come from the factor when considering the effect of ionization on the number density. Let me think about it.

If the ionization reduces the number of neutral gas molecules by a factor, say, 1/1.22, then the mean free path would increase by 1.22. So suppose that the ionization reduces the number of neutral molecules to 1/1.22 times the original. Then λ increases by 1.22.

But why would the ionization fraction be exactly 1/1.22? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of the electron beam, the gas is ionized, and the neutral molecules' number density decreases, so the mean free path increases. It might be more than 1.22 times, but the options don't specify the exact factor.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So if the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, leading to a lower number density of neutral gas, then the mean free path increases. So λ2 > λ1. The question is, does it go beyond 1.22λ1?

In the scenario, when Mike initiates the electron beam, he finds that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but λ2. The question is whether λ2 is greater or less than λ1.

In the given options, only option C suggests λ2 is less, others suggest greater. So the correct conclusion should be that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the answer would be either A or D.

But the question says Mike observed that the mean free path was λ2, even though the temperature remained the same. So the change is due to the electron beam.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, electrons are moving and can cause gas molecules to be displaced, but perhaps the gas density isn't the only factor. Maybe the electron beam causes some heating or other effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which introduces more charged particles into the system. These charged particles (ions and electrons) might have a different impact on the gas's mean free path.

But wait, the presence of charged particles could lead to different collision dynamics. For instance, electrons are much lighter than gas molecules, so they might have a different effect on collisions.

Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me take a step back.

The mean free path of gas molecules (neutral) is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 * n * d²), where n is the number density and d is the molecular diameter.

If the number density n decreases, λ increases. So the question is, does the number density of neutral molecules decrease when the electron beam is on?

If the electron beam is causing ionization, then n decreases, so λ increases.

So λ2 > λ1.

So the options are A, B, C, D. B says λ2 equals λ1, which would mean Mike's observation is wrong, but the question states that he did observe a change, so B is probably incorrect.

So between A and D, which are λ2 >=1.22λ1 or 1.22λ1>λ2>λ1.

Wait, but why would it be 1.22 times? I'm not sure about that factor. Maybe it's not necessary for the answer, just that λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the options don't have a "greater than λ1" without a specific factor. So the options are:

A: lambda2 >= 1.22 lambda1

C: lambda2 < lambda1

So according to our analysis, lambda2 is larger than lambda1, so C is incorrect.

But in the options, the only ones that suggest lambda2 > lambda1 are A and D.

Wait, the problem said that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1. So it could have increased or decreased.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being bombarded and scattered by the electrons. This could cause more frequent collisions between the gas molecules, effectively increasing the collision rate, which would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, but the collision rate is determined by the number density and cross-section. If the number density of gas molecules decreases (due to ionization), then the collision rate would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path.

But if the gas is ionized, the neutral density is lower, so the mean free path of the neutrals is longer.

Wait, but in the scenario, the electron beam is causing the gas to be active, but perhaps it's also creating more gas particles, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the electron beam is causing more gas to enter the compartment, but the scenario says the pumps are creating an ultra-high vacuum, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam adds more energy to the system, causing the gas molecules to move faster. Since mean free path also depends on temperature, but the temperature is the same.

Wait, no. The formula for mean free path I thought of earlier is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). Alternatively, another form is λ = 1/(√2 * n * d²), where n is number density.

Since T is the same, any change in λ can only come from n or d. If the electron beam causes ionization, the number of neutral molecules n decreases, so λ increases.

So λ2 is bigger than λ1. Therefore, the correct answer is A or D.

But why choose between A and D?

The question says Mike accurately determined the mean free path when the electron beam was off. Then, when the beam was on, the mean free path became λ2. So what changes when the electron beam is on?

If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, then n decreases, so λ increases.

Wait, but could there be another effect? For example, the electron beam may cause the gas to heat up, increasing the temperature, but the problem states that the temperature remained the same. So T is the same.

So the only change is n, the number density of neutral gas.

So, n decreases when the beam is on, leading to λ2 being greater than λ1.

So the options are A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1 or D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

But why is 1.22 a key factor here?

Wait, perhaps because the ionization changes the effective cross-section. Oh, wait, when a molecule is ionized, it becomes charged, so the cross-section for collisions might be different. But I'm not sure. If the ionized particles have a larger effective diameter, then d² would be larger, leading to a smaller λ. But if the number density n decreases, λ increases.

Hmm, so two effects: n decreases (increasing λ), but d² could increase (decreasing λ).

Which effect dominates?

If the number density n drops by a certain factor, and d² increases by another, the net effect on λ depends on which effect is stronger.

But without knowing the exact changes in n and d, it's hard to say.

But since the problem doesn't mention any other factors, perhaps we can assume that the change in n is the dominant factor.

So if n decreases, then λ increases. So lambda2 is bigger than lambda1. Therefore, options A or D.

But the options don't say what the actual factor is. So perhaps the correct answer is A, indicating that the mean free path is at least 1.22 times longer.

Wait, but why 1.22? That number is familiar from the context of increased mean free path due to lower pressure. Maybe in this case, the change in number density leads to a factor of about 1.22 increase, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is not that large, but the question is just asking whether it's larger or smaller. Since the options only have A and C as possibilities (with others being D and B), and the correct conclusion is that it's larger, so the answer is either A or D.

Wait, let's think about the actual physical scenario. When the electron beam is on, the gas becomes partially ionized. The neutral gas density decreases, so their mean free path increases. At the same time, the ionized gas (ions and electrons) might have a different mean free path because they are charged and perhaps move faster or interact differently with the walls or other particles.

But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, which are mostly neutral. Or perhaps Mike is measuring the mean free path of the gas, regardless of whether they are charged or not.

Wait, the problem states that Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules (presumably the neutral ones) as λ1. When the electron beam is on, the same gas molecules are ionized, so the number of neutral molecules decreases, leading to a longer mean free path.

So in this case, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So looking at the options, the possible answers are A and D. However, since option D suggests that λ2 is less than 1.22λ1, but we don't know the exact factor, perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, but the options don't have a "greater than λ1" without more info.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are A, B, C, D. So if the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, then among the options, A and D are the possibilities.

But why would it be exactly 1.22 or less than that?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, because the electron beam causes more scattering, leading to a shorter mean free path. But I thought earlier that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose in a vacuum, the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, gas molecules are being hit by electrons, causing more collisions. So the gas molecules might collide more often, reducing the mean free path.

Wait, but wait—when the electron beam is on, the gas is being ionized, so the number of neutral molecules decreases. So the number density n decreases. So the mean free path increases, because λ is inversely proportional to n. So as n goes down, λ goes up.

But then why would the presence of the electron beam cause more collisions? Because the electron beam is causing ionization, which reduces the number of neutral molecules, meaning collisions between neutral molecules happen less. So the mean free path increases.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer is either A or D. But the options don't provide a general 'greater than' option except for A and D.

Wait, what's the possible reasoning for the factor 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately the square root of 1.5, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 1.22 could be sqrt( (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P) ) but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps 1.22 is the factor when considering the effective collision diameter for charged particles, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the ionization doesn't change the number of gas molecules but changes their charge state.

Wait, no. If the gas is ionized, the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, but the total number of gas particles (ions and electrons) may not change because each ionization creates an ion and an electron. But in reality, the electron beam may cause some gas to be removed or pumped out, but the question states that the pumps are already creating a high vacuum.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam doesn't change the number of neutral gas molecules. It just changes their state. So, if the gas is now partially ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases, leading to a lower n.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct answer is C, λ2 < λ1, because the electron beam scatters the gas molecules more, causing more frequent collisions.

Wait, but the mean free path is determined by the gas's own pressure and temperature, not the electron beam's presence. Hmm, but the electron beam could cause gas heating, but the problem says the temperature is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes more gas particles to be present in the compartment, but that seems unlikely because the pumps are maintaining a high vacuum. So the presence of the beam shouldn't increase the number of gas molecules.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be struck by electrons, causing them to move (due to momentum transfer). This could increase the rate of collisions between gas molecules, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but if the number of gas molecules is the same, and the beam causes them to move faster, then the collision rate would increase, leading to a shorter mean free path.

But in the initial state, the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, even though the number of molecules is the same, their velocity increases, leading to more frequent collisions, thus a shorter mean free path (λ2 < λ1).

Wait, but the number of neutral molecules must be the same. If the beam doesn't change the number of gas molecules, but just their velocity, then the mean free path depends on velocity.

Mean free path can also be expressed as λ = v * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. If velocity increases, but the collision rate increases (so τ decreases), the effect on λ depends on which effect is stronger.

But in the formula, λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), which doesn't include velocity directly. Since T is same, if P decreases, λ increases. But if the electron beam increases the velocity, perhaps T increases, but the problem says temperature is same.

This is getting too complex. I think the initial reasoning that ionization reduces n (number of neutral gas) and thus increases λ is correct. So λ2 > λ1, so the answer is A or D.

But the question asks what can we conclude about λ2.

The options say, "what can we conclude about λ2".

If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, n decreases, so λ increases.

So in this scenario, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, but without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. However, the options don't have an option that simply says λ2 > λ1. The options are A, which says >= 1.22λ1, D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1, and C says λ2 < λ1.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by high-energy electrons, which causes more frequent collisions between gas molecules. Thus, the mean free path would decrease.

Wait, but if the beam is causing the gas to ionize, the number of neutral molecules decreases, so the mean free path should increase.

I'm getting more confused. Another approach: look up what happens to the mean free path when a gas is ionized.

Upon a quick search (in mind), I recall that in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the charged particles move more freely. But in a weakly ionized gas, the neutral molecules' mean free path might not change much, but if the number of neutral molecules decreases, then their mean free path increases.

Wait, but in a plasma, electrons have a much shorter mean free path. But that's for the electrons. For the neutral gas, if their number density decreases, their λ increases.

So I think, in this case, λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the options don't have a simple 'greater than' option. So between A and D, but the problem gives option A as ≥ 1.22 λ1.

Wait, perhaps the factor arises from the relation between the neutral density and the ionized state. Let me think about it in terms of partial ionization.

If f is the fraction of ionized gas, then the neutral density is n(1-f). So λ2 = λ1/(1-f).

If the ionization fraction f is, say, 20%, then (1-f) is 0.8. λ2 = 1.25 λ1, which is 1.25 * λ1. So 1.25 is greater than 1.22. So in this case, λ2 would be greater than 1.22 λ1, so option A would apply.

But if f is less than 20%, then 1/(1-f) would be less than 1.25. For example, f=15%, 1/(0.85)=1.176, which is just above 1.17, less than 1.22. So λ2 would be 1.176 λ1, which is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, making option D correct.

But in this scenario, Mike accurately determined λ1 when the beam was off. Then, upon turning the beam on, he found a different λ2. So the question is, what's the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

Without knowing the exact ionization fraction, but knowing that the presence of the beam causes ionization, the mean free path increases, but it's not clear by how much.

But the options don't have a 'greater than' without a specific factor. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, but the options don't have that. Therefore, the only option that says λ2 is greater than is option A or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, λ2 < λ1.

Wait, why? Because when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being heated or something, but the problem states the temperature remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes more scattering, leading to more collisions, which reduces the mean free path.

Wait, but that's only if the number of gas molecules is higher. But with the pumps, the number is already low, so the beam may not significantly change the number.

Another approach: think about the electron beam's effect as causing more gas molecules to be in motion, leading to more frequent collisions.

Wait, but the formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(√2 π d² n), where n is number density. So, if the number of gas molecules (n) increases, λ decreases. But in this case, the pumps are maintaining a high vacuum, so n remains almost the same. But the beam might cause the gas molecules to hit the walls more, but that's not affecting n.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to more gas molecules being in a certain state, making their effective diameter larger, thus increasing d², which would decrease λ.

But I'm not sure about that.

I think I'm going in circles. Based on the earlier analysis, the conclusion should be that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is A or D. But since the options don't have a 'greater than' without a factor, perhaps A is incorrect and the correct answer is C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam creates an electric field. The gas molecules, which are neutral, might experience a slight force, but since they're neutral, maybe not. Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the ions would be accelerated by the electric field, which could cause them to move faster, but that's about their velocity, not the mean free path.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C, λ2 < λ1. Because when the electron beam is on, the gas is more active, leading to more frequent collisions.

But earlier I thought ionization decreases n, leading to longer λ. But I'm not entirely certain.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll settle on the conclusion that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the relationship between the mean free path of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber under two conditions: when the electron beam is off (mean free path = λ₁) and when the electron beam is on (mean free path = λ₂). The key factors to consider are the effects of ionization caused by the electron beam on the gas molecules.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path of gas molecules is given by:

   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot d^2}
   \]

   where \(n\) is the number density of the gas molecules, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(T\) (temperature) is constant.

2. **Effect of Ionization**: When the electron beam is turned on, it causes partial ionization of the gas molecules. This reduces the number density of neutral gas molecules (\(n\)) because some molecules are converted into ions and electrons. A lower \(n\) increases the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).

3. **Impact of Electron Beam**: The electron beam does not significantly alter the total number of gas molecules (as the vacuum pumps maintain a low pressure), but it does reduce the number of neutral molecules. This reduction in neutral density leads to an increase in the mean free path of the remaining neutral gas molecules.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests that the mean free path increases by at least a factor of 1.22. This is plausible if the ionization fraction is significant, as the number density of neutral molecules decreases, leading to a longer mean free path.
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement that Mike observed a change in \(\lambda\). Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a shorter mean free path, which would occur if the electron beam caused an increase in collisions. However, ionization reduces the number density of neutral molecules, which increases the mean free path. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a moderate increase in the mean free path, less than a factor of 1.22. While possible, the problem does not provide enough information to confirm this specific range.

5. **Conclusion**: The presence of the electron beam reduces the number density of neutral gas molecules, leading to an increase in the mean free path (\(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\)). Among the options, **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))** is the most consistent with the scenario described.

ANSWER: A
