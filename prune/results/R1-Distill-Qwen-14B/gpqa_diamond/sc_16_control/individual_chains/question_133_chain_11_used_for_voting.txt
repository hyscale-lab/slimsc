Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and calculating concentrations. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a solution with 200 cm³ (which I need to convert to liters, I remember 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 0.2 L). It contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions (I think that's PO4^3-).

Wait, the Ka values are provided for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. I remember that these dissociation constants help determine the pH and the predominant species in solution.

So, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, right? And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So when these salts dissolve in water, they dissociate into ions. Let's think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water molecules, which probably don't affect the ion concentration much here.

Wait, but the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. That makes me think of a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. Hmm, but in solution, especially given the pH, PO4^3- might not be the dominant species. Let me think about the pH first.

Wait, the solution is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Because H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (Ka2 is 6.2e-8). So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the two substances are KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-). So the buffer here is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base) because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. So the buffer system is based on the second dissociation of H3PO4: H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

So, the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. Because the solution volume is 200 cm³ (0.2 L), I can calculate moles of each salt and then their concentrations.

Let me calculate the moles first.

For KH2PO4:
Mass = 1.00 g
Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol
Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007354 mol

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Mass =1.00 g
Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol
Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol

So, moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.007354 mol.
Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 is 0.005613 mol.

Now, the volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007354 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03677 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02806 M

Wait, but these are the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively. So the buffer system is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), so the relevant pKa is the second one, Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 7.21).

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])
pH = 7.21 + log(0.02806 / 0.03677)
Calculate the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03677 ≈ 0.7638
Log(0.7638) ≈ -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093.

Hmm, but wait, the question isn't asking about pH. It's asking about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Oh, right, PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which comes from the third dissociation of H3PO4: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, so the pKa3 is about 11.74 (since log(1.8) is ~0.255, so 12 - 0.255 is 11.745).

Wait, but in the solution, the pH is around 7.09, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74). So what does that mean for the concentration of PO4^3-?

In an acidic solution (pH 7 < pKa3 11.74), the equilibrium will favor the protonated form, so HPO4^2- will not dissociate much into PO4^3-. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

To find [PO4^3-], I can use the third dissociation equation.

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-
Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M (from earlier), and [H+] can be found from the pH we calculated earlier.

pH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

Plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.29e-8)
Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14
Divide by denominator: 5.0508e-14 / 8.29e-8 ≈ 6.097e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option A) 6.24e-7, or option D) 3.97e-7. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, let's recalculate the [H+] correctly.

pH = 7.093 → [H+] = 10^(-7.093). Let me compute that more accurately.

10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^0.093 is approximately 1.24 (since 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, so 0.093 is a bit less). So 1.24 * 1e-7 = 1.24e-7. Wait, wait, no: 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093). 10^(-0.093) is about 0.865. So 1e-7 * 0.865 ≈ 8.65e-8 M. Approximately 8.65e-8.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 8.29e-8, but perhaps a better approximation is 8.65e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.65e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.65e-8: 5.0508e-14 / 8.65e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.65) * 1e-6.

5.0508 / 8.65 ≈ 0.5838.

So 0.5838e-6 → 5.838e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.84e-7 M. But looking at the options, the closest is option B) 5.48e-7, or option D) 3.97e-7. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the concentrations of the ions.

Wait, another thing: when I calculated [HPO4^2-], I used 0.005613 mol in 0.2 L. Let me recheck that.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

So concentration is 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M. Correct.

H2PO4^- is 0.007354 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03677 M. Correct.

Then using Henderson-Hasselbalch, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is 7.21.

Ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03677 ≈ 0.7637.

Log(0.7637) → Let me compute that more accurately.

Log(0.75) is about -0.1249, log(0.8) is about -0.0969. 0.7637 is 0.75 + 0.0137. So maybe around -0.117.

So pH = 7.21 -0.117=7.093, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute log(0.7637) more accurately.

Using more precise calculation: 0.7637 is approximately e^(-0.27), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the formula log(0.7637).

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

We know that log(7.637 × 10^-1) = log(7.637) + (-1).

Log(7.637) is between log(7) = 0.8451 and log(7.637) ≈ 0.8836 (since 10^0.88 ≈ 7.64). So log(0.7637) ≈ 0.8836 -1 = -0.1164.

So pH = 7.21 - 0.1164 = 7.0936, which I can round to 7.093.

So [H+] is 10^-7.093 = approximately 8.29e-8 M? Wait, wait. Let me compute 10^(-7.093).

7.093 = 7 + 0.093.

So 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^-0.093 is approximately 10^(-0.09) → 10^(-0.09) is about 0.8123.

Wait, 10^(-0.09) → I think it's better to calculate it accurately.

Using logarithm tables or approximation:

Let me use natural logs to approximate.

ln(10^x) = x ln(10).

But for small x, 10^x ≈ 1 + x ln(10).

Wait, perhaps better to use the Taylor series or a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I can compute 10^-0.093.

0.093 in ln terms is about 0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.214.

So e^(-0.214) ≈ 1 - 0.214 + (0.214^2)/2 - (0.214^3)/6.

0.214^2=0.0458, 0.214^3≈0.00977.

So 1 -0.214 = 0.786. Plus 0.0458/2=0.0229 → 0.8089. Minus 0.00977/6≈0.00163 → 0.8073.

So e^(-0.214) ≈ 0.8073. So 10^(-0.093)= ~0.8073.

Thus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8073 ≈ 8.073e-8 M.

So back to [PO4^3-].

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]
= (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.073e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0517e-14 / 8.073e-8 → 5.0517 / 8.073 ≈ 0.626, so 0.626e-6 → 6.26e-7 M.

That's about 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer would be A.

But wait, another thought: the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Are these the only sources of phosphate ions? I think so. So the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but is there any other source? For example, the first dissociation of H3PO4? H3PO4 is a weak acid, but I don't think it's present in the solution. The salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, so the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Another thing to consider: The solution might also have some PO4^3- from the third dissociation of H3PO4, but under pH 7, I think HPO4^2- is the main species, and PO4^3- is minimal.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider all possible sources. But in the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are much higher than any other species, so PO4^3- is negligible unless the solution is very basic.

But in this case, the pH is about 7.1, which is below pKa3 (11.74), so PO4^3- is indeed very low.

Hmm, but why isn't the concentration higher? Because the pH is way below the pKa3, so the HPO4^2- doesn't dissociate much into PO4^3-.

Wait, but what about the initial amounts of phosphate? Let me think, maybe I should calculate the total concentration of phosphate species and then find the PO4^3-.

Wait, another approach: the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing another H+. But as the solution is acidic, very little of this happens.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the third dissociation constant.

But I think my earlier calculation is correct. So why don't the options match exactly? Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation.

Wait, the ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03677 ≈ 0.7637.

Wait, but Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]). So that's correct.

Wait, let me compute the pH again precisely.

pKa2= log(6.2e-8) → what is the exact value? Let me compute it.

Ka2=6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 8 - log(6.2) → log(6.2) is approximately 0.7924. So pKa2 is 7.2076, approximately 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.7637) → log(0.7637)= approximately -0.1164. So pH=7.208 -0.1164=7.0916.

So [H+]=10^-7.0916 ≈ 8.07e-8 M.

Hmm, that's consistent with earlier calculation.

So [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.07e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) * 1e-12 → 0.050517 *1e-12 =5.0517e-14.

Denominator:8.07e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 /8.07e-8 = 5.0517/(8.07) *1e-6 → 0.626 *1e-6 →6.26e-7 M.

Which matches option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, but why is the option D 3.97e-7? Did I miss anything?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total concentration of phosphate. The problem states that the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. But the PO4^3- is from the HPO4^2- dissociation. But wait, perhaps the solution is such that the HPO4^2- is the main source, and the H2PO4^- is the other.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the contribution from the H2PO4^- dissociating into HPO4^2- and H+, but that might not be significant since the solution is already a buffer.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the concentrations considering all the possible species, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles.

KH2PO4: 1 g / 136.09 g/mol = moles.

136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.1.

1 / 136.1 = approx 0.007353 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005613 mol.

So the concentrations are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH.

Another approach: using the exact expression for the buffer.

But Henderson-Hasselbalch is an approximation when the concentrations are much higher than the ionization, which is the case here. So that's probably correct.

Hmm, I think my initial approach is correct, which gives me about 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But looking at the options again:

A) 6.24e-7
B)5.48e-7
C)2.81e-7
D)3.97e-7.

So my calculation leads to A.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, the solution is 200 cm³, and the grams are 1.00 each.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, but perhaps the 2 H2O in the formula affects the molar mass? Wait, no, because the molar mass given is 177.99 g/mol, which includes the 2 H2O. So the molar mass is correct as given.

So, I think option A is correct. But why is option D close to half of that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of PO4^3- comes from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. H2PO4^- cannot directly form PO4^3- under these conditions without going through HPO4^2- first, and given the pH, it's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value of [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation without approximation.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is exactly what I did.

Wait, what's the exact value of [H+] again? pH is 7.093 → [H+] = 10^-7.093.

Let me compute 10^-7.093 more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

7.093 = 7 + 0.093.

10^7 is 1e7, so 10^-7 is 1e-7.

10^-0.093 → let's compute log(10^-0.093)= -0.093 → but we need the value of 10^-0.093.

Using logarithm tables or a calculator, but since I don't have a calculator, I can approximate.

We know that 10^(-0.09) ≈ 0.8123 (since 0.8123^10 ≈ 10^(-0.9)).

Wait, 10^(-0.09) = 1/(10^0.09).

10^0.09 → let me compute ln(10^0.09) =0.09 * ln(10)=0.09*2.302585≈0.207.

e^0.207≈ 1 + 0.207 + (0.207^2)/2 + (0.207^3)/6 ≈ 1 + 0.207 + 0.0214 + 0.0014 → approx 1.2298.

So 10^0.09 ≈ 1.2298.

Thus, 10^-0.09 ≈ 1/1.2298≈0.8123.

Similarly, 0.093 is a bit higher than 0.09. So 10^-0.093 is slightly less than 0.8123.

Approximating 10^(-0.093)=0.8123 - (0.003)*(10^-0.093 derivative).

Wait, perhaps better to compute it using a linear approximation.

Let x=0.09, y=0.093, delta_x=0.003.

We know f(x)=10^-x.

f'(x)= -10^-x * ln(10).

At x=0.09, f(x)=0.8123, f'(x)= -0.8123 * 2.3026≈-1.870.

So f(0.093) ≈ f(0.09) + f'(0.09)*0.003 → 0.8123 + (-1.870)*0.003 → 0.8123 - 0.00561 → 0.8067.

So 10^-0.093 ≈ 0.8067.

Thus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8067 = 8.067e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.067e-8) → (5.0517e-14)/(8.067e-8) ≈ 6.265e-7 M.

So again, around 6.26e-7, which is option A.

Hmm, but why is option D so much lower? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: did I mix up the moles?

Wait, the Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2- per formula unit, right? Because Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So yes, 1g of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1/177.99 ≈0.005613 mol of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, 1g of KH2PO4 gives 1/136.09≈0.007354 mol of H2PO4^-.

So the concentrations are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider that some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-? But in the buffer, that would be minimal because the pH is near the pKa2, which is why the buffer exists. So, the contribution of HPO4^2- from H2PO4^- is accounted for in the buffer equation, but for the third dissociation, it's negligible.

Thus, I think my initial calculation holds, leading to [PO4^3-]≈6.26e-7 M, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, and the molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- For KH₂PO₄:
  \[
  \text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007354 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.007354 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:
  \[
  \text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.005613 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 0.2 L. The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007354 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03677 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the relevant dissociation constant being Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸. The pKa₂ is:
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02806}{0.03677}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.7637) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093
\]
Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately 7.093.

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The third dissociation of phosphate involves HPO₄²⁻:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]
The equilibrium constant is:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
From the pH, [H⁺] is:
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately **6.26 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: A
