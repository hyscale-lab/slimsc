Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think it's related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period or the orbital speed. Oh right, the RV method depends on the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P * (2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, wait. Or maybe it's better to recall that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * ( (1/P) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1.

But since both stars have the same mass, M_star is the same for both. And the planets have similar masses, so M_planet is about the same for both. So if M_planet and M_star are the same, then K should be proportional to (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Actually, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1/P) )

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses, the only variable here is the orbital period.

Wait, but wait. The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, another version of the formula I remember is:

K = ( ( (2π G) / (P c^3) ) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that (P^2) = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis.

But considering that M_planet is much smaller than M_star (since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So Kepler's third law simplifies to P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star).

But how does that relate to the RV semi-amplitude? The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K ≈ (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3))

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: The velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit is inversely related to the orbital period. Because, if a planet has a longer period, it's moving more slowly around the star, so the star doesn't have to move as much for us to detect the same RV shift. Wait, no, that's the other way around. If the orbital period is longer, the planet is moving more slowly, so the star's velocity change is smaller. So K is larger when the period is shorter because the planet's orbital speed is higher.

Wait, yes. For a given planet mass and star mass, a shorter period (closer-in planet) would cause a larger RV shift. Because the planet is moving faster, so the star's velocity has to be higher to balance. So if Planet #1 has a larger RV shift than Planet #2, that would mean Planet #1's period is shorter.

Wait, in this question, Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, the question says that the shift for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7. Wait, but higher shift (7) would mean a larger K. So if K is higher for Planet #2, that would imply that either the planet is more massive, the star is less massive, or the orbital period is shorter.

Wait, but in this question, the stars and planets have the same masses. So same M_planet, same M_star. So the only variable is the orbital period.

So K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3) because when you have a shorter P, the (1/P)^(1/3) is larger. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So if K2 / K1 = (7/5), then (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = 7/5.

Wait, but wait. Let me write the proportionality.

K2 / K1 = ( (P1 / P2) )^(1/3 )

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) ⇒ K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So rearranging, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

We can take both sides to the power of 3 to get (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

We have K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Which is P1 * (125/343).

So the ratio P2/P1 is (125/343) ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 / P1 = 0.364.

So the ratio is approximately 0.36, which would be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because if K is larger, the period is shorter. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 is shorter, so P2/P1 is less than 1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of #1, so it's shorter. So if the question is how much longer is #2's period than #1's, it would be 0.36 times, which is less than 1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.

Wait, wait, the question says: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is shorter than P1, then it's not longer. So the ratio is 0.36, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So higher K implies smaller P. So K2 =7 > K1=5, so P2 < P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer is 0.36, option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is proportional to \( (1/P)^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because \( K \) depends on the orbital speed of the star, which is inversely related to the orbital period for a given system.

In this problem, two stars with identical masses host planets with similar masses to Neptune. The RV shifts for the two planets are given as 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2. Since the stars and planets have the same masses, the only variable is the orbital period. A larger \( K \) (7 milliangstroms for Planet #2) implies a smaller orbital period because \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

To find the ratio of the orbital periods, we use the relationship:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
