Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values: delta_0 is 90 degrees, delta_1 is 67, delta_2 is 55, delta_3 is 30, and delta_4 is 13 degrees. Oh, wait, phase shifts are denoted by δ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So each delta corresponds to a specific l value.

The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has both real and imaginary parts. But for specific directions, like along the beam (θ=0), some terms might simplify.

Wait, when the scattering is along the beam direction, θ=0, so the direction is the same as the incident direction. I think that in this case, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part might be related to the sum over all the phase shifts multiplied by certain factors.

I remember that the scattering amplitude f has a form involving the sum of terms for each l. Oh right, the general expression for f is something like:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + lφ) / (1 + cosθ) ) ] ... No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another approach: the scattering amplitude in the case of elastic scattering can be written as a sum over partial waves.

Wait, the imaginary part specifically. There's a formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction. Oh, right! I think I remember that when φ = 0 (since the incident beam is along, say, the z-axis, so the scattered direction would have φ=0 as well), the imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l +1) sin(delta_l) ].

Because the scattering amplitude f can be written as f = sum_l ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) + ... ]? Hmm, not exactly sure. Wait, maybe I should recall that for the case of θ=0 (head-on scattering), the expression simplifies.

Wait, no, the question says along the incident beam direction. So that would be θ=0, but for the direction along the beam, maybe it's θ=0 or θ=π? Wait, no, along the beam direction is θ=0 (forward direction), so the scattering is forward.

Wait, but the exact formula I'm trying to remember. Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(delta_l), where delta_l is the phase shift for each l.

So, the formula is Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin(delta_l)

But wait, the problem says to ignore rest of the phase shifts beyond delta_4. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So, I can compute each term for l=0 to 4.

But first, I need to know what k is. Because k is the wave number, which depends on the energy of the incoming electrons.

The electrons have energy E =50 MeV. I think the formula for k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but wait, the units here might be in terms of MeV and fm. Let me think about units.

Wait, the options are in fm, so the result is in femtometers. Let's recall that ħc ≈ 197.327 MeV fm. So, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of the relativistic expression.

Wait, for a non-relativistic particle, E = p²/(2m), where p is the momentum. But for high energy electrons, like 50 MeV, they are relativistic. Hmm, but maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given in the lab frame, so we can use E = (p^2 c^2)/(2m_e c^2) + m_e c^2, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the problem gives E as 50 MeV, perhaps the momentum p can be found using the relativistic relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave number k can be approximated using the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but in cases where E is in the same units as ħ^2/(2m), which for electrons would be in eV or MeV.

Wait, let me think about the units. Let's compute k in terms of inverse femtometers because the result is in fm.

Given that:

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm

So, ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c

But in natural units where c=1, so ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, another approach: The expression for k is given by k = (sqrt(2 m_e E)) / ħ

But E is 50 MeV. Let's compute k.

But m_e is the electron mass. m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV.

Wait, in units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so to express k:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ

But E is 50 MeV. So,

sqrt(2 m_e * 50 MeV ) / ħ

Hmm, but in terms of units, this will be tricky. Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

m_e is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². So m_e = 0.511 MeV/(c²).

So, 2 m_e E = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV.

Wait, but units are getting messy. Perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of ħ c.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the scattering amplitude f is dimensionless, but in practice, it's multiplied by some factors involving ħ and c. Or perhaps in this problem, they are considering the units such that k is in inverse fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l), and k is the wave number in units of inverse femtometers.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find k in terms of the given energy.

Wait, the electron's momentum p is given by E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 )

So, for E=50 MeV, m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2

So, (p c)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (2500 - 0.261) (MeV)^2 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So, p c ≈ sqrt(2499.739) MeV ≈ 49.9973 MeV ≈ 50 MeV.

So, p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

Then, the wave number k is p / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So,

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = (50 / 197.33 ) (1 / fm ) ≈ 0.2532 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute 50 divided by 197.33.

50 / 200 is 0.25, so about 0.2532.

So, k ≈ 0.2532 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but 1/k would be about 3.95 fm, which is the wavelength? Hmm, not sure, but maybe.

Wait, but in the formula for Im[f], it's (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum.

So, the sum is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(delta_l degrees). Let me compute each term.

Given:

l=0: delta_0 =90 degrees → sin(90)=1 → term = 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: delta_1=67 degrees → sin(67) ≈ 0.9205 → term =3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2: delta_2=55 → sin(55)= approx 0.8192 → term=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3: delta_3=30 → sin(30)=0.5 → term=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: delta_4=13 → sin(13)≈0.22495 → term=9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Adding all terms:

1 + 2.7615 =3.7615

+4.096 → 7.8575

+3.5 → 11.3575

+2.0245 → 13.382.

So the sum is approximately 13.382.

Then, Im[f] = (1/(2k)) * sum.

We have Im[f] = (1/(2 * 0.2532 fm^{-1})) * 13.382.

Compute 2 *0.2532 = 0.5064 fm^{-1} → 1/0.5064 ≈ 1.974 fm.

Multiply by 13.382: 1.974 *13.382 ≈ let's calculate.

1.974 *13 = 25.662

1.974 *0.382 ≈ 0.755

Total ≈ 25.662 +0.755 ≈26.417 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are around 26 fm. The options are A) 87163 fm, which is way too big, B) 355, C) 177, D)251.27.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the sum. Let me recalculate the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l):

l=0: 1 * sin(90) =1 → 1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67) ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9*0.22495≈2.0245.

So sum is 1 + 2.7615 =3.7615; +4.096→7.8575; +3.5→11.3575; +2.0245→13.382. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the units for k. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k should be in terms of the Compton wavelength.

Wait, the wave number k is p/ħ, but perhaps in the formula, the correct expression uses k in units of inverse fm, but I have to make sure about the units.

Wait, 1/k is the wavelength λ. So, if k is 0.2532 fm^{-1}, then λ = 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

But in the formula, 1/(2k) would be about 1.975 fm.

Wait, 1/(2k) = (1/(2 *0.2532 fm^{-1} )) )= 1/(0.5064 fm^{-1}) )= 1.975 fm.

Then, Im[f] = 1.975 fm * 13.382 ≈26.42 fm.

But the options don't have anything close. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula isn't correct. Another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} [something]. Wait, perhaps I should be using e^{i delta_l} -1, or something else. Because I think I might have mixed up the formula.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f has a partial wave expansion:

f(theta, phi) = sum_{l=0}^infty (2l +1)/(2ik) [ e^{i delta_l} P_l(cos theta) ]

Wait, but when theta is zero, cos theta is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So,

f(0, phi) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1)/(2ik) e^{i delta_l}.

But when phi is 0, the exponential becomes e^{i delta_l} = cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l).

Wait, but the expression for f is a complex quantity. So, the imaginary part would be the sum over (2l+1)/(2k) sin(delta_l).

Wait, because the real part would be the sum over (2l+1)/(2k) cos(delta_l), and the imaginary part is sum (2l+1)/(2k) sin(delta_l).

Wait, but wait, the formula for f is (2l+1)/(2ik) e^{i delta_l}, so when theta=0, phi=0, it becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) e^{i delta_l}.

So, the amplitude f is (sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l}) / (2ik) )

So, to get the imaginary part, we have Im(f) = [sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l)] / (2k)

Wait, that's because e^{i delta} = cos(delta) + i sin(delta), so the imaginary part would be [sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l)] / (2k)

Wait, wait, no. Because f is (sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l}) )/(2ik)

So, the imaginary part of f is Im( sum (2l+1) e^{i delta} / (2ik) )

But 1/(2ik) is a real number times 1/(i), which is imaginary. Let me compute 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So, when I multiply by e^{i delta_l} = cos(delta) + i sin(delta), I get:

sum (2l+1) (cos(delta) + i sin(delta)) ) * (-i)/(2k)

= sum (2l+1) [ -i cos(delta) -i^2 sin(delta) ] / (2k)

= sum (2l+1) [ -i cos(delta) + sin(delta) ] / (2k)

So, the imaginary part of f is sum (2l+1) (-cos(delta)) / (2k) ?

Wait, because the imaginary part comes from the term multiplied by i. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the imaginary part directly.

Let me write f = (sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l}) )/(2ik)

The imaginary part of f is Im( [ sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} ] ) / (2k )

Because 1/(2ik) is (-i)/(2k), which when multiplied by a complex number a + ib gives (-i a + b)/(2k). The imaginary part of that is (b)/(2k), which is the same as the real part of the original numerator.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Let me compute Im(f) = [ sum_{l} (2l+1) * Im(e^{i delta_l}) ] / (2k )

Since e^{i delta} has Im part sin(delta).

So, Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (2k )

Ah, that makes sense. So, the initial approach was correct.

So, Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (2k )

So, now, the sum is approximately 13.382 as before, and k = 0.2532 fm^{-1}.

So, 2k = 0.5064 fm^{-1}

Thus, Im(f) = 13.382 / (0.5064) fm^{-1} → 13.382 / 0.5064 → about 26.42 fm.

But the options don't have 26.42. The closest option is D) 251.271 fm, which is about ten times larger.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me re-examine the calculation of k.

Earlier, I computed k as p / ħ, but perhaps I should have used k = ħ p / (ħ^2) ?

Wait, no, k is p/(ħ). Let me think again.

E = 50 MeV is the kinetic energy? Or the total energy? No, the problem states it's 50 MeV electrons, which is the kinetic energy? Or the total energy? Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because I assumed E is the kinetic energy, but in reality, E is the total energy.

Wait, the total energy E is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But in this case, E is the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Wait, no, E is the total energy. So, the kinetic energy K is E - m c^2.

Wait, the problem states it's 50 MeV electrons. So, E is the kinetic energy plus rest energy. Hmm, wait, electrons at 50 MeV would have E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

But perhaps in the problem, E is given as the kinetic energy. Wait, but the problem says "50 MeV electrons", which usually refers to their kinetic energy. Or does it refer to the total energy?

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me recalculate p using the correct approach.

If E is the total energy, then E = 50 MeV = K + m c^2.

Wait, no, wait. The rest energy is 0.511 MeV, so if the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, then the total energy is 50.511 MeV.

But perhaps the problem treats E as the kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are non-relativistic, but with 50 MeV, that's highly relativistic.

Wait, going back: The formula for k is k = (2mE)^{1/2} / ħ

Wait, but that formula is correct only for non-relativistic cases, where E = p²/(2m). But 50 MeV is much larger than the rest energy of the electron (0.511 MeV), so the electrons are ultra-relativistic. Thus, the non-relativistic formula isn't valid.

So, for relativistic particles, the relation between E, p, and m is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So, I should compute p correctly.

E = 50 MeV. m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So,

E² = (pc)^2 + (0.511)^2 → (50)^2 = (pc)^2 + (0.511)^2 → (pc)^2 = 2500 - 0.261 ≈2499.739 → pc = sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.997 MeV → p = (49.997 MeV ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So,

k = (49.997 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = (49.997 /197.33 ) (1 / fm) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Same as before. So, k is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so the previous calculation of Im(f) being about 26.4 fm doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: The scattering amplitude in the Born approximation or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total cross-section or something else. Wait, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. But in this problem, the question isn't about the cross-section but the amplitude itself.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I used is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (2k )

But perhaps I should include a factor of 1/(2ik) correctly. Wait, perhaps I should use (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} -1 ] / (2ik) as the partial wave contribution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula.

Wait, another formula I recall is the optical theorem, which states that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

But the problem isn't about the cross-section, it's about the amplitude.

Wait, another thought: The forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) can be written as f(0) = 1/(2ik) sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l}.

But, because e^{i delta_l} = cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l), the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (2k )

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, but the calculation gives about 26.4 fm, which is not among the options.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units for k. Let's double-check.

k is in units of inverse femtometers. So, when I compute 1/(2k), it's in femtometers.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the sum multiplied by 1/(2k) correctly.

Sum is 13.382.

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.2532 fm^{-1}) ) → 1/(0.5064 fm^{-1}) ) → approximately 1.975 fm.

So, Im(f) = 13.382 * 1.975 fm ≈26.42 fm.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l + pi/2) )

Wait, no, that would change the sine terms.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the phase shifts given are for the partial waves, but in the formula, we need to use (l+1/2) instead of (2l+1)? No, I think (2l+1) is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the phase shifts as in e^{2i delta_l}.

No, the formula uses e^{i delta_l}.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I used radians in the sine function.

Ah! Oh no! I think I made a mistake here. Because when I compute sin(delta_l), I assumed delta_l is in radians, but the phase shifts are given in degrees.

So, for example, delta_0 is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. So, sin(90 degrees) is 1, which is correct.

But when I computed sin(67 degrees), I should have converted 67 degrees to radians to compute the sine accurately.

Wait, if I compute sin(67 degrees) → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

So, compute each sin(delta_l) in radians.

Let me recalculate the sum correctly.

Compute each (2l+1) * sin(delta_l in radians)

l=0: delta=90 degrees = π/2 ≈1.5708 rad. sin(1.5708)=1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: delta=67 degrees →67 * π/180≈1.16937 rad.

sin(1.16937) ≈approx 0.9170 (exact value? Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 67 degrees: 67 * π/180 = 1.169370568 radians.

sin(1.169370568) ≈0.9205 (because 67 degrees sine is 0.9205, as I thought earlier).

So, term is 3 * 0.9205 =2.7615.

l=2:55 degrees →55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

sin(0.95993)=0.8192 → term 5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:30 degrees → pi/6=0.5236 rad.

sin(0.5236)=0.5 → term 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:13 degrees →13 * pi/180≈0.22689 rad.

sin(0.22689)≈0.225 → term 9 *0.225≈2.025.

Wait, so sum is 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.025=13.3825.

So same sum as before. So that doesn't change anything.

Hmm, so that can't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the sum is multiplied by a factor of 2 because of something else. Or maybe the formula I'm using is the real part, not the imaginary?

Wait, no, because the formula for Im(f) is correct.

Hmm, maybe the wave number k is not 0.2532 fm^{-1}, but something else.

Wait, let me recompute k.

p = (E² - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / c.

Wait, E is the total energy, which for 50 MeV electrons is 50 MeV plus 0.511 MeV? Or is it just 50 MeV?

Wait, the problem says the electrons have energy 50 MeV. So, it's likely that E is the kinetic energy, which is 50 MeV. So, the total energy is E_total = K + m c^2 =50 +0.511 ≈50.511 MeV.

So, E_total =50.511 MeV.

Then, E_total^2 = (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 → (50.511)^2 = (p c)^2 + (0.511)^2.

So, (p c)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈50.511^2 is approx 2551.5 MeV^2.

Wait, 50.511^2 = (50 +0.511)^2 =50^2 + 2*50*0.511 +0.511²=2500 +51.1 +0.261≈2551.361.

Subtracting (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 → (pc)^2≈2551.361 -0.261=2551.1 → pc≈sqrt(2551.1) ≈50.508 MeV.

So, p≈50.508 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ =197.33 MeV fm / c.

So, k = (50.508 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) → 50.508 /197.33 ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, k≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Then, 1/(2k)=1/(2 *0.256)≈1/(0.512)=≈1.953 fm.

So, Im(f) = (13.382) * 1.953 ≈26.15 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, another possibility: Did I forget to account for the fact that the phase shifts are given for each l, and perhaps I should be using the formula for the differential cross-section?

Wait, the differential cross-section is given by |f|², but the question is about the imaginary part of f.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l)) )/(2k) multiplied by some factor of (ħ c)^2 or something else.

Wait, because the scattering amplitude f has units of length (in natural units where ħ c=1, but in real units, it's in fm). So perhaps the formula I used is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are in the hundreds of fm. My calculation is about 26 fm, but the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the phase shifts. Let me reread the question.

The phase shifts given are delta_0=90, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) in radians.

Wait, but earlier I used degrees, but perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? No, because the question says degrees. So no.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum in a different way.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l), but perhaps the sum is multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include a factor of 2 for each term, making it (2l+1)*2 sin(delta_l). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) )/(k), not 2k.

In that case, Im(f) = sum/(k) → 13.382 /0.256 → approx52.28 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but then another thought: The units of k are in 1/fm, so 1/k is in fm. So, 1/k is about 3.907 fm.

So, if the sum is 13.382, then 13.382 * (1/k) →13.382 *3.907 ≈52.26 fm.

Hmm, again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) )/(2k) multiplied by a factor of 2.

Wait, no, that would bring it back to 26.42.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) )/(k), giving 52.26 fm.

But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, the options are B) 355, C) 177.675, D)251.27.

Hmm, 251 is about 4.7 times 52.26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum accurately.

Compute each (2l+1)*sin(delta_l) where delta_l is in degrees, but with more precise sine values.

l=0: 90 degrees → sin=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1:67 degrees → sin(67)=approx 0.920504 → term=3 *0.920504=2.761512.

l=2:55 degrees → sin(55)=approx 0.819152 → term=5 *0.819152=4.09576.

l=3:30 degrees → sin=0.5 → term=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:13 degrees → sin(13)=approx 0.224951 → term=9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Sum: 1 +2.761512 =3.761512; +4.09576=7.857272; +3.5=11.357272; +2.02456=13.381832.

So sum ≈13.3818.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * (ħ c) / (2k) ?

Wait, because sometimes in scattering theory, factors involving ħ c can appear.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

But earlier, k = p/ħ = (50.5 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm c^{-1} ) → 50.5/(197.33) ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k = (1/0.256) fm ≈3.906 fm.

Compute sum * (ħ c) / (2k) ?

Wait, sum is13.3818.

(ħ c)=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

Im(f) = [13.3818 * 197.33 MeV fm ] / (2k )

But 2k = 2 *0.256 fm^{-1} → 0.512 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f)= (13.3818 *197.33 ) / (0.512 ) fm.

Compute numerator: 13.3818 *197.33 ≈ approx 13.38 *200 =2676, but more accurately:

13 *197.33= 2565.29.

0.3818 *197.33≈75.38.

Total≈2565.29 +75.38=2640.67.

So, 2640.67 / 0.512 ≈5153.5 fm.

But that's way larger than any options provided.

Hmm, this can't be right. Option A is 87163 fm.

So this suggests I'm on the wrong track.

Another angle: Perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the problem states degrees. So I think that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * (ħ c) / (2k )

Wait, but that would give units of MeV fm * fm → MeV.

But the options are in fm, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express k in terms of MeV.

Wait, k is in 1/fm, so 1/fm = MeV/(ħ c), since ħ c is in MeV fm.

So, 1 fm^{-1} = (ħ c) / fm^2 → Wait, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Hmm... I'm stuck.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is actually (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * (ħ c) / (2 m_e c^2 )

Wait, let's compute this.

sum=13.3818.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

Im(f) = [13.3818 * (197.33 MeV fm) ] / (2 *0.511 MeV) )

= (13.3818 *197.33 ) / (1.022) fm.

Compute numerator: 13.3818 *197.33 ≈approx 2640 MeV fm.

Divide by 1.022 → 2640 /1.022 ≈2583 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the option D is 251.271 fm, which is about a tenth of 2583. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I confused MeV and MeV²? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Wait, but the problem says degrees. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin(delta_l) multiplied by (ħ c)²/(2m_e c^2 k). Let me see:

sum=13.3818.

(ħ c)^2 ≈ (197.33 MeV fm)^2 = 38933.3 MeV² fm².

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f) = [ sum * (ħ c)^2 ] / [ 2 m_e c^2 k ]

= [13.3818 *38933.3 ] / [2 *0.511 *0.256 ] (MeV² fm² / (MeV * fm^{-1} )) )

Wait, units: (MeV² fm²) / (MeV * fm^{-1}) ) → MeV fm^3.

But I'm not sure. Let me compute the numbers:

13.3818 *38933.3 ≈ approx 13 *38933=506,130, plus 0.3818 *38933≈14,856 → total≈520,986.

Denominator: 2 *0.511 *0.256 → 2 *0.511=1.022; 1.022 *0.256≈0.262.

So, 520,986 / 0.262 ≈1,988,500.

But this gives Im(f) ≈1,988,500 fm^3? But that's way beyond the options. Not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options. Option D is 251.271 fm. Let me see: 251.271 / 26.42 is about 9.5. Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of pi somewhere? Or perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin(delta_l/2) ?

No, that would change the sum significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider only the first few terms. Wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond delta_4, which I already did.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is [ (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) ] * (ħ c ) / (2k ), but let's compute that.

Sum is 13.3818.

(ħ c )=197.33 MeV fm.

2k=0.512 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f) = (13.3818 *197.33 ) / 0.512 fm.

Compute numerator: 13.3818 *197.33 ≈2640.67 MeV fm.

Divide by 0.512 fm^{-1} → 2640.67 /0.512 →approx5153.6 fm². No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] * (ħ c ) / (k )

So,

Im(f)= (13.3818 *197.33 ) / 0.256 fm^{-1} →2640.67 /0.256 →about10,293 fm.

Not matching.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the given phase shifts are for the partial wave amplitudes, not the phase shifts. No, the question states phase shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but the question says degrees. If I mistakenly treat them as radians, then the sum would change.

Let's compute the sum if delta_l were in radians.

Compute each term:

l=0: delta_0=90 degrees = pi/2 ≈1.5708 rad. sin=1 → term=1.

l=1:67 degrees =1.16937 rad. sin≈0.9170 → term=3*0.917≈2.751.

l=2:55 degrees=0.95993 rad. sin≈0.8165 → term=5 *0.8165≈4.0825.

l=3:30 degrees=0.5236 rad. sin=0.5 → term=3.5.

l=4:13 degrees=0.2269 rad. sin≈0.226 → term=9 *0.226≈2.034.

Sum≈1+2.751=3.751 +4.0825=7.8335 +3.5=11.3335 +2.034≈13.3675.

So sum≈13.3675.

Then, Im(f)=sum/(2k) →13.3675/(2*0.256) →13.3675/0.512≈26.10 fm.

Hmm, same result as before. So this doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 2 in the denominator, making it 1/(4k), not 1/(2k)?

But that would give Im(f)=13.382/(4 *0.256) ≈13.382/1.024≈13.07 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum/(k), which would be 13.382/0.256≈52.25 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin(delta_l) summed and multiplied by 2, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, maybe the wave number k is in a different unit. Perhaps I should calculate it in inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers.

Wait, no, because the options are in femtometers, so the units must match.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * ( ħ c ) / (2 m_e c^2 )

Because sometimes in scattering theory, when dealing with units, factors of mass come into play.

Let me compute that.

sum=13.3818.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

Im(f) = (13.3818 *197.33 ) / (2 *0.511 ) fm.

Compute numerator: 13.3818 *197.33 ≈2640.67.

Denominator: 2 *0.511=1.022.

So, 2640.67 /1.022 ≈2583 fm.

Hmm, again, but option D is 251.27 fm, which is about a tenth. Did I miss a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps I should have used (ħ c )^2 instead.

Wait, no, that would make the units even bigger.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula. Maybe the imaginary part is actually (sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(delta_l)) )/(2k )

Wait, then for l=0: 1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(67)). cos(67)=0.3907 → 1-0.3907=0.6093 →3 *0.6093=1.828.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(55)). cos(55)=0.5736 →5 * 0.4264≈2.132.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(30))=7*(1 -0.8660)=7*0.134≈0.938.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(13)). cos(13)=0.9744 →9 *0.0256≈0.230.

Sum:1 +1.828=2.828 +2.132=4.96 +0.938=5.898 +0.230=6.128.

Then, Im(f)=6.128/(2*0.256)=6.128/0.512≈12.01 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, another thought: Maybe the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) ) * sin(delta_avg), where delta_avg is the average of delta_l's.

But that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) multiplied by 2.

Which would give 13.382 *2=26.764.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are to be used as delta_l = pi - delta_l (some reflection?), but that would change the sine to negative.

But then the sum would be negative, which the options are positive.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * ( ħ c ) / (2 m_e c^2 )

Which I computed earlier as 2583 fm. But option A is 87163 fm, which is about 34 times larger.

Wait, 2583 *34≈87822, close to option A.

But why would that factor appear?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, let me recompute k accurately.

E=50 MeV (kinetic energy?) or total energy?

Assuming E is the kinetic energy, the total energy would be E_total = K + m c^2 =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

So,

E_total² = (pc )² + (m c² )² → (50.511)^2 = (pc )² + (0.511 )^2 → (pc )²=50.511^2 -0.511^2 = approx 2551.361 -0.261=2551.1 → pc= sqrt(2551.1 )= approx50.508 MeV.

So, p=50.508 MeV/c.

Then, k= p/ħ= (50.508 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) =50.508 /197.33 =0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, but perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the total energy. Let me compute that.

E=50 MeV (total energy).

E² = (pc )² + (0.511 )^2 → (50 )^2=2500 = (pc )^2 +0.261 → (pc )^2=2499.739 → pc=49.997 MeV →p=49.997 MeV/c.

Then, k=49.997/197.33≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/(2k)=1/(0.506 )≈1.976 fm.

Sum is 13.3818 → Im(f)=13.3818 *1.976≈26.42 fm.

No help.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) multiplied by tan(delta_l) ?

No, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are to be used in radians, so recalculate the sum.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct approach is to select the option closest to 26.42, which is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 k )

Wait, sum=13.3818.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f)= (13.3818 *197.33 ) / ( 2 *0.511 *0.256 ) fm.

Compute numerator: 13.3818 *197.33 ≈2640.67 MeV fm.

Denominator: 2 *0.511 *0.256 =0.262 MeV fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f)=2640.67 /0.262 →approx10,082 fm.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 ) * (1/k )

Let me compute:

sum=13.3818.

(ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )= (197.33 )/(2*0.511 )=197.33/1.022≈193.13.

So,

Im(f)=13.3818 *193.13 * (1/k ) → 13.3818 *193.13 ≈2583.9.

Then, 1/k=3.906 fm.

So,

Im(f)=2583.9 *3.906≈10,100 fm.

Again, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is indeed one of the options, and my approach has a fundamental mistake.

Wait, I think I'll try to look for another approach: The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is proportional to the total cross-section.

But the question isn't about the cross-section but the amplitude.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / (2k) multiplied by (ħ c ), but let's compute:

sum=13.3818.

(ħ c )=197.33 MeV fm.

2k=0.512 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f)=13.3818 *197.33 / 0.512 → (13.3818 *197.33 )=2640.67 →2640.67 /0.512≈5153.6 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * ( ħ c )/(2 k )

Which would be 13.3818 *197.33 /0.512 → same as above.

Hmm... I'm not making progress. So perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l +1) multiplied by sin(delta_l) and then multiplied by ( ħ c )^2 / (2 m_e c^2 k ).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is simply sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) multiplied by ( ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 ) → 13.3818 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 ) →13.3818 *193.13 →approx2583.9.

But that gives a value in fm, which is 2583.9 fm. Not matching any options.

But option D is 251.271 fm, which is approximately 1/10th of that. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts were given in radians, but I treated them as degrees.

Let me recalculate the sum with phase shifts in radians.

Compute each (2l+1) * sin(delta_l_radians )

l=0:90 degrees=1.5708 rad → sin=1 → term=1.

l=1:67 degrees=1.16937 rad → sin=0.9170 → term=3*0.917=2.751.

l=2:55=0.95993 rad → sin=0.8165 →5*0.8165=4.0825.

l=3:30=0.5236 rad → sin=0.5 →7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:13=0.2269 rad → sin=0.225 →9*0.225=2.025.

Sum=1+2.751=3.751 +4.0825=7.8335 +3.5=11.3335 +2.025=13.3585.

So sum≈13.3585.

Compute Im(f)= sum/(2k ) →13.3585/(2*0.256 )=13.3585/0.512≈26.09 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, the options are in the hundreds. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm.

But I can't see why my calculation isn't matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) ) * ( ħ c ) / (2 k )

Sum (2l+1) for l=0 to4: 1+3+5+7+9=25.

So, 25 *197.33 / (2 *0.256 ) →25 *197.33=4933.25 → 4933.25/(0.512 )=9635 fm.

No, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (sum (2l+1) ) * ( ħ c ) / ( k )

Which would be 25 *197.33 /0.256 →25*197.33=4933.25 →4933.25/0.256≈19264 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make a guess based on the options. The closest I get is 26 fm, which isn't an option. But the option D is 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used 0.256 fm^{-1} and multiplied by 100, giving 25.6 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that would be incorrect, but let's see.

If k=2.56 fm^{-1}, then 1/(2k)=0.1953 fm.

Im(f)=13.3818 *0.1953≈2.61 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are to be summed as (2l+1) * (1 + sin(delta_l) ), but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * ( ħ c ) / (k ), which would give 13.3818 *197.33 /0.256 →13.3818 *771. ≈10,300 fm.

No.

Hmm. I think I might have to conclude that the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not sure how to reach it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the given phase shifts are not for l=0 to4, but for l=1 to4, so l starts at 1. But the question says delta_0, delta_1, etc.

No, the question includes delta_0.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are for each l+1/2, but that complicates.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * ( ħ c ) / (2 m_e c^2 )

Which would be sum=13.3818.

(ħ c )=197.33 MeV fm.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

Im(f)= (13.3818 *197.33 ) / (2 *0.511 ) fm.

13.3818 *197.33 =2640.67.

2640.67 / (1.022 )=2583 fm.

So, Im(f)=2583 fm.

But option A is 87163 fm, which is about 34 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the total energy.

Let me recalculate k.

E=50 MeV (total energy).

E² = (pc )² + (m c² )² → (50 )^2=2500= (pc )^2 +0.261 → (pc )^2=2499.739 → pc=49.997 MeV → p=49.997 MeV/c.

k= p/ħ=49.997 /197.33 →≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f)= (13.3818 *197.33 )/(2 *0.253 ) →13.3818 *197.33=2640.67 →2640.67 /0.506 ≈5223 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, but option A is 87163 fm, which is much larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (sum (2l+1) ) * ( ħ c )^2 / (2 m_e c^2 k )

sum=25.

(ħ c )^2= (197.33 )^2 ≈38933 MeV² fm².

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Im(f) = (25 *38933 ) / (2*0.511 *0.253 ) fm.

Compute numerator:25 *38933=973325.

Denominator:2 *0.511=1.022; 1.022 *0.253≈0.2586.

So, 973325 /0.2586 →approx 3,762,000 fm.

No, way too big.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to pick option D as the closest, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately 2583/7.3, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 25.83, giving 25.83 *13.382≈346.3 fm. Close to option B (355) but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply the sum by (ħ c )/(2 k ) →13.3818 *197.33 / (2 *0.256 ) →13.3818 *197.33=2640.67 →2640.67 /0.512≈5153 fm.

Hmm, no.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which would be sum * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 ) →13.3818 *193.13≈2583 fm.

But option A is 87163, which is about 34 times larger. So perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (ħ c )^2 / (2 m_e c^2 k ), which I did earlier and got 10,082 fm.

But it's not matching.

At this point, I think I might have to conclude that I'm missing a key factor or formula. Perhaps the correct approach is to use (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * ( ħ c ) / (2 m_e c^2 ), which gives 2583 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is 251.27 fm, close to 2583 /10.27, but I can't figure out why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but in the formula, they are used in radians, so the sum is larger.

Wait, if I take the phase shifts as in radians, recalculate the sum:

sum (2l+1)*sin(delta_l_radians )

l=0: 90 degrees=pi/2 → sin=1 →1.

l=1:67 degrees →1.16937 rad → sin≈0.917 →3 *0.917=2.751.

l=2:55 degrees→0.95993 rad →sin≈0.819 →5 *0.819=4.095.

l=3:30 degrees→0.5236 rad →sin=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:13 degrees→0.2269 rad →sin≈0.225 →9 *0.225=2.025.

Sum=1+2.751=3.751 +4.095=7.846 +3.5=11.346 +2.025=13.371.

Then,

Im(f)=13.371/(2k)=13.371/(2*0.256 )=13.371/0.512≈26.12 fm.

No help.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should consider that the formula uses (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) * (ħ c ) / (2 m_e c^2 )

Which gives 2583 fm. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as (2l+1) multiplied by (1 - cos(delta_l) ), but that gives a much smaller sum.

Wait, sum (2l+1)(1 - cos(delta_l) )

l=0:1*(1-0)=1 →1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos67)=3*(1-0.3907)=3*(0.6093)=1.828.

l=2:5*(1 - cos55)=5*(1-0.5736)=5*(0.4264)=2.132.

l=3:7*(1 - cos30)=7*(1-0.8660)=7*(0.134)=0.938.

l=4:9*(1 - cos13)=9*(1-0.9744)=9*(0.0256)=0.230.

Sum=1+1.828=2.828 +2.132=4.96 +0.938=5.898 +0.230=6.128.

Im(f)=6.128/(2k )=6.128/0.512≈12.01 fm.

No match.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with the initial calculation of approximately 26 fm, which isn't an option. But since the options are much larger, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula involving units.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * ( ħ c ) / (2 m_e c^2 )

Which would be sum=13.3818.

(ħ c )=197.33 MeV fm.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

Im(f)=13.3818 *197.33/(2*0.511 ) →13.3818 *197.33=2640.67 →2640.67/(1.022 )≈2583 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm. Maybe there's a typo in the question, and the energy is 500 MeV or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I'm not seeing it.

Well, I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the options and my calculations, I think the correct answer is D) 251.271 fm.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated as $k = p / \hbar$, and $p$ is the momentum of the electrons. The energy of the electrons is given as 50 MeV, and the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is used to compute $p$. The reduced Planck constant $\hbar$ is related to the Compton wavelength $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Calculate Momentum ($p$):**
   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
   \[
   E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2,
   \]
   where $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ (total energy) and $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$. Solving for $p$ gives $p \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV}/c$.

2. **Calculate Wave Number ($k$):**
   Using $k = p / \hbar$ and $\hbar = \hbar c / c$, where $\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$:
   \[
   k = \frac{49.997}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Sum Over Phase Shifts:**
   The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude depends on the sum:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l),
   \]
   where $\delta_l$ is in degrees. Converting $\delta_l$ to radians for accurate sine calculations:
   - $\delta_0 = 90^\circ \to \sin(90^\circ) = 1$,
   - $\delta_1 = 67^\circ \to \sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205$,
   - $\delta_2 = 55^\circ \to \sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192$,
   - $\delta_3 = 30^\circ \to \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$,
   - $\delta_4 = 13^\circ \to \sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495$.

   The contributions are:
   - $l=0$: $(2(0)+1)\sin(90^\circ) = 1$,
   - $l=1$: $(2(1)+1)\sin(67^\circ) \approx 3(0.9205) = 2.7615$,
   - $l=2$: $(2(2)+1)\sin(55^\circ) \approx 5(0.8192) = 4.096$,
   - $l=3$: $(2(3)+1)\sin(30^\circ) \approx 7(0.5) = 3.5$,
   - $l=4$: $(2(4)+1)\sin(13^\circ) \approx 9(0.22495) = 2.0245$.

   Summing these gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0245 = 13.382.
   \]

4. **Compute $\text{Im}(f)$:**
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin(\delta_l),
   \]
   where $2k = 2(0.253) \approx 0.506 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$. Thus:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f) = \frac{13.382}{0.506} \approx 26.42 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

5. **Mismatch with Options:**
   The calculated value of $\text{Im}(f) \approx 26.42 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **D) 251.271 fm**, which is approximately 9.5 times larger. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or a missing factor in the calculation. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: D**
