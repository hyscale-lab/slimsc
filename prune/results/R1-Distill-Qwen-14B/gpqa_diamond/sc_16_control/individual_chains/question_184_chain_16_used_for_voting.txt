Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but I'll break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Benzene has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me draw it mentally. Position 1 is where the ethoxy is attached. Then, moving clockwise, the next position (position 2) has the tert-butyl group, and the one after that (position 3) has the nitro group. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement relative to each other.

Now, the starting material is benzene. I need to add these substituents in the correct order. The thing is, each substitution reaction can influence where the next substituent goes. If I add a directing group, subsequent reactions might be directed to certain positions.

Let me recall. Nitration is a meta-directing reaction when the substituent is nitro. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether) and it's ortho/para-directing. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and also ortho/para-directing. But wait, tert-butyl is a strong activating group, but because it's bulky, it might direct meta in some cases, but generally, it's para and ortho.

Wait no, wait. Alkyl groups are activating, ortho/para directors. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing. So, the order in which I add these groups will influence where the next substituent goes.

The target has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl groups. Let me think about the possible order of introducing these groups.

One approach is to use the directing effects of each substituent to place the next group correctly. So, if I first introduce a nitro group, which is meta-directing, that might complicate things because nitro is strong deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps I should introduce the activating groups first, which would direct the incoming substituents to ortho and para positions, making it easier to add the nitro group later in a specific position.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group. So, perhaps I need to nitrate after adding the activating groups. Because once I add a nitro group, the ring becomes deactivating, making further substitutions harder.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Introduce the tert-butyl group first. Since it's a bulky, activating group, it's an ortho/para director. But because it's bulky, the next substituent might be more likely to add para to it.

2. Next, introduce the ethoxy group. Ethoxy is activating and ortho/para. But wait, if I have a tert-butyl group already, where will the ethoxy go? If I add ethoxy next, it would go into positions ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Wait, but if I add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro, I need to make sure that each group is added in the correct position relative to the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first. Let's think.

If I start with benzene, and first introduce ethoxy. Ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para director. Then, adding tert-butyl next. But where would tert-butyl go? It would be directed by the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is para to itself, maybe the tert-butyl would add either ortho or para to ethoxy.

Wait, the target has tert-butyl at position 2 and ethoxy at position 1. So in the benzene ring, if ethoxy is at position 1, then position 2 is adjacent (ortho) to it. So the tert-butyl is ortho to ethoxy. That might be possible.

But then, the nitro group is at position 3. Let me count: position 1 (ethoxy), position 2 (tert-butyl), position 3 (nitro). So, the three substituents are in a row. But benzene is a ring, so maybe the positions are 1, 2, and 3 in a way that each is adjacent.

Wait, wait. Let me imagine benzene: positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row. So, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4 (which is meta to position 1 (ethoxy)).

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the order of substitution as follows: adding the tert-butyl first, then the ethoxy, then the nitro.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced before the tert-butyl or ethoxy. Let me think.

Wait, but nitration is a strong reaction, and the nitro group is a strong deactivator. So, if I nitrate first, the ring becomes deactivating, making it harder to add the other groups. So perhaps it's better to add the nitro group last, when the ring is activated.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so perhaps I need to plan the order such that each step adds the next group in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

Another approach is to think about the substituents' activating or deactivating nature. Since nitro is deactivating, it's best to add it after the other two activating groups. Because adding it first would make the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions.

So the plan might be:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Nitrate the ring to introduce nitro.

But I need to ensure that each step directs the next group to the correct position.

Let me think about each substitution step.

First step: add tert-butyl. Since benzene is the starting material, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to form carbocations, which can lead to rearrangements. Alternatively, perhaps using tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 as a catalyst? That's correct for Friedel-Crafts.

So step 1: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3, which would add the tert-butyl group to benzene.

Now, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

Next, where to add the ethoxy group. Ethoxy is an activating group, so we can perform an etherification, which is typically done via the Williamson synthesis, but that's for alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution where the benzene ring is activated.

Wait, no, more correctly, to add an ethoxy group to benzene, we can perform an etherification. One common method is using ethanol with a strong acid, but perhaps using a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution where the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether coupling.

Wait, no, another method is using ethyl chloride and a base, but that's not correct because Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, but that's for alkyl halides. Wait, but the ethoxy group is an ether, so perhaps it's better to do an etherification via the benzene ring's electrophilic substitution.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. To add an ethoxy group to benzene, we can perform an etherification reaction. One way is the Scholl reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using ethyl chloride and a Lewis acid like AlCl3, but wait, that's more for alkylation, which would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy.

Ah, right! To introduce an ether substituent, we can use a method like the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction for aryl ethers, but that's for producing diaryl ethers. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to first introduce a nitro group to direct, but that's getting ahead of myself.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the steps again. The target has an ethoxy group, which is an activating group. So after adding the tert-butyl group, adding ethoxy next. How?

Ah, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution of a leaving group. Wait, but benzene doesn't have a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps I should first add ethoxy as a substituent. Another approach is to use the ethyl group attached to the ring, then convert it to ethoxy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using an electrophilic substitution where the ethyl group is introduced first, then converted to an ether.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding substituents. Let's outline the possible order:

Option 1:

1. Add tert-butyl to benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Add ethoxy group to tert-butylbenzene.

3. Nitrate the benzene to add nitro group.

But where would each substituent go?

After adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated, and the tert-butyl is an ortho/para director. So when adding the ethoxy group, it would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, and the tert-butyl is at position 2. So, in that case, the ethoxy would be in the para position relative to the tert-butyl, which would be position 4? That doesn't match the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then the tert-butyl. Let me try that.

Option 2:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl group to ethoxybenzene.

3. Nitrate the ring.

In step 1, adding ethoxy to benzene gives ethoxybenzene (phenetole). Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para director.

In step 2, adding tert-butyl to ethoxybenzene. The tert-butyl group would be directed by the ethoxy group to ortho or para positions. If the ethoxy is at position 1, then tert-butyl can go to position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2. So perhaps in this scenario, the tert-butyl would be added at position 2, ortho to ethoxy.

Then, step 3 is nitrating. Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Both are activating groups. So the nitro group would go where?

Wait, the directing effects of the substituents depend on their positions. The ethoxy at 1 is an activating, ortho/para director. The tert-butyl at 2 is also activating, ortho/para director. But in this case, the positions might influence each other.

Wait, but when multiple substituents are present, the strongest directors take precedence. Wait, ethoxy is more activating than tert-butyl? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, both are activating, but perhaps the substituent that is more strongly activating or has a stronger directing effect will dominate.

Alternatively, in a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can direct the incoming group to certain positions. For example, if you have substituents at positions 1 and 2, the next group might be added at position 3 or 4, depending on their directing effects.

Wait, in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl at position 2 and next to the ethoxy at position 1. Wait, perhaps when you have substituents at positions 1 and 2, the meta positions to each would be position 4 and position 5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, when you have substituents in positions 1 and 2, the next group could be added at position 3 or 4. Let me think about the directing.

Ethoxy (1) is ortho/para. Tert-butyl (2) is ortho/para. So, looking for where would the next group go.

The next substituent would go into a position that is ortho to at least one of them. For example, position 3 is meta to ethoxy (1) but ortho to tert-butyl (2). So the nitro group would be added at position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy. But since the ethoxy is activating and a strong director, perhaps it would influence more.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so once added, it would make the ring less reactive. But in this step, we're adding nitro. So, during nitration, the ring has activating groups at 1 and 2. So the incoming nitro group would be directed by the most activating group.

Which group is more activating? Ethoxy is stronger activating than tert-butyl? Because ethoxy is an O- group, which is more activating. Wait, no, tert-butyl is an alkyl group (strong activating via +I effect), while ethoxy is activating via resonance. Wait, actually, I think that activating substituents can be compared: groups that donate electrons via resonance are more activating than those that donate via induction. So, ethoxy is more activating than tert-butyl? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Alkyl groups are strong activating because of their +I effect. Ethoxy is an activating group because of resonance, but perhaps it's less activating than alkyl groups? Wait, no, I think that alkyl groups are stronger activating than alkoxy groups. Because alkoxy groups have lone pairs that can conjugate into the ring, but alkyl groups donate through induction, which is perhaps a stronger effect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: activating groups can be either via resonance (like -O-) or via induction (like alkyl groups). Alkoxy groups are activating, but they are more activating via resonance, but in benzene, the activating effect of an alkyl group is stronger than that of an alkoxy group? Or is it the opposite?

No, wait. Alkyl groups are strong activating due to their +I effect. Alkoxy groups are activating because of resonance, which is a strong effect, but perhaps they are less activating than alkyl groups. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, I think that the order of activating strength is: groups that donate electrons via resonance (like -O-) are more activating than those that donate via induction (like alkyl groups). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I'm pretty sure that alkyl groups are stronger activating than alkoxy groups. Because the alkyl groups donate electrons through induction, which is a continuous effect, whereas alkoxy groups donate through resonance, which is more localized. So, for instance, toluene is more reactive than phenetole (ethoxybenzene) towards electrophilic substitution. Wait, no, that can't be right because phenetole is an activating group, but maybe it's less activating than toluene.

Wait, perhaps I should look this up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I know. Let's assume that alkyl groups are stronger activating than alkoxy groups. So in the molecule with ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (strong activating, ortho/para), the tert-butyl group is a stronger director.

So in the nitration step, the nitro group would be added in a position that's ortho or para to the tert-butyl. But in the target, it's at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl (position 2) and meta to the ethoxy (position 1). So that's possible.

Wait, but if the tert-butyl is at position 2, the ortho positions are 1 and 3. So position 3 is ortho to tert-butyl. So when nitrating, the nitro group would go into position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl. That matches the target structure.

So the order of steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl to ethoxybenzene. Since ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl would go to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitrate the benzene ring, where the nitro group would add at position 3, ortho to the tert-butyl group.

That seems to fit the target structure.

Now, let's think about the reactions needed for each step.

Step 1: Adding ethoxy to benzene. How is that done? This is an etherification. One way is to use benzene with a strong base and ethyl halide, but that's more for alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but that's for adding acyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct method is to use ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid catalyst, but that would alkylate the benzene, not add an ethoxy group. Wait, no, benzene can undergo nucleophilic substitution under certain conditions, but it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps using a diazonium salt. Wait, no, that's for substituents like amino groups.

Wait, another approach: maybe using a benzene ring with a nitro group first, but that would complicate things. Hmm.

Wait, another method for introducing an ether group is the use of a Williamson ether synthesis. But that's typically used when you have an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, but when the benzene ring is involved, perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups on the ring. Wait, but benzene itself isn't activated, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation followed by hydrolysis. For example, introducing an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts, then converting it to an ethoxy group. But how?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an ethyl group as a substituent. Once attached, perhaps we can perform an oxidation or some other reaction to convert the ethyl group into an ethoxy group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Grignard reagent. But Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups, not directly to benzene rings.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, if I have a benzene ring with a good leaving group, like a nitro group, but that would require a meta position.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a benzene ring that's already substituted. Let me think about what the options are giving. The options are sequences of reactions, so perhaps the order in which the substituents are added is crucial.

Wait, looking at the options, option D, for example, starts with nitration, then adds tert-butyl, then nitrates again. That might not be right.

Alternatively, let's look at the reaction steps in each option.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that's a lot of steps, including things like sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4), which adds a sulfonic acid group, a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. But in our target molecule, I don't see a sulfonic acid group. So that might not be the right option.

Option B: i) tert-butyl; ii) nitrate; iii) Fe/HCl (which is a reducing agent, perhaps used in diazotization); iv) nitrate again; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+/H2O/heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3/H2SO4; ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, but after nitration, adding Fe/HCl doesn't make much sense unless it's for a reduction. But nitro groups are reduced to amines with Fe/HCl. But in our target, we have a nitro group, so maybe that's not the case.

Option C: i) tert-butyl; ii) SO3 (sulfonation); iii) nitrate; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) nitrate again; vii) H3O+/H2O/heat; viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Again, sulfonation is present, which is not in our target. So perhaps C is out.

Option D: i) nitrate; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) tert-butyl; iv) nitrate; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+/H2O/heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, adding nitro first. Then Fe/HCl (maybe to reduce nitro to amine?), but in our target, we have nitro, so perhaps that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3) adds an alkyl group (tert-butyl) to benzene.

HNO3 with H2SO4 is nitration.

SO3 with H2SO4 is sulfonation, adding a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

NaNO2/HCl is for diazotization of an aryl amine under cold conditions (0-5°C). But if we have a nitro group, perhaps not.

H3O+ with H2O and heat might be for hydrolysis, perhaps of a nitro group or something else.

NaOH with EtBr is for an SN2 reaction, perhaps substituting a leaving group with ethoxide.

Fe/HCl is for reducing nitro groups to amines. For example, nitrobenzene can be reduced to aniline with Fe and HCl.

So, perhaps the correct sequence involves introducing the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups before nitration.

Wait, but how to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after making a benzene ring with a leaving group. But benzene doesn't have leaving groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group. For example, if I first introduce a nitro group, which is meta-directing, then add another group, but nitro is deactivating, which complicates further reactions.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last. Let me think again about the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added through a substitution reaction. For example, if we have a tosyl group (a good leaving group) attached to benzene. Then, replacing the tosyl group with an ethoxy group via an SN2 reaction. But how do we get the tosyl group onto benzene?

Alternatively, perhaps using a benzene ring with a leaving group like a nitro group, but that's not straightforward.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the possible steps in each option.

Looking at option D: the first step is nitration. So benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.

Then, step ii is Fe/HCl. That would reduce the nitro group to an amine. So now we have aniline (aminobenzene).

Step iii: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation; but wait, aniline is strongly activating, making the ring very reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So adding tert-butyl to aniline would be easy, but where?

Aniline's amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So the tert-butyl would add either ortho or para to the amino group.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is at position 3. So if we have the amino group at position 1, adding tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para), then we would later nitrate position 3.

Wait, but let's see:

After nitration (step iv), which is another nitration. But wait, after step iii, we have a tert-butyl group at, say, position 2 and amino group at position 1. Then step iv is nitration again. The amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director, and the tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So the incoming nitro group would go to positions that are ortho or para to either of them.

But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4.

Wait, position 3 is meta to the amino group (position 1) and ortho to the tert-butyl (position 2). So perhaps in this scenario, the nitro group would be added at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl and meta to the amino. But since amino is a stronger director, the nitro would prefer to go ortho or para to it. Hmm, that could complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps in option D, after steps i, ii, iii, the substituents are at 1 (amino) and 2 (tert-butyl). Then, step iv is nitration. The amino group directs nitration to ortho and para, which would be positions 2 (already occupied) and 4. So the nitro would go to position 4, but in the target it's at position 3.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps option D isn't the right sequence.

Let me think about another option. Option B starts with adding tert-butyl, then nitrates.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added. Since tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director, the nitro would go either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to the tert-butyl.

Let's say it goes to position 2. Now, the ring has tert-butyl at 1 and nitro at 2.

Step iii is Fe/HCl. That reduces nitro to amine. Now, positions 1 (tert-butyl) and 2 (amine).

Then step iv is nitrate again. Nitration of aniline (amine) is possible, but amines are strong activating, so nitration would occur quickly. Where would the nitro group go? The amine is at 2, directing ortho (1 and 3) and para (5). But position 1 is already occupied by tert-butyl. So the nitro would go to position 3 or 5.

But in the target, we have a nitro at 3, and ethoxy at 1. But wait, in this scenario, ethoxy hasn't been introduced yet.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, let's think about the steps again.

If I want to introduce ethoxy, perhaps I can do it via a nucleophilic substitution after making a benzylic chloride. But that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via amination, then diazotization, then substitution with ethoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, the order of substituents should be such that each new substituent is added in the correct position based on the directing of the existing groups.

If I add the ethoxy first, then the tert-butyl, and then nitro, that might work.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene.

Wait, perhaps using a benzene ring with a good leaving group, like a nitro group, but that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acyl group, then reducing it to an alcohol, then converting to an ether.

Wait, let's outline this possibility:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation with acetic anhydride → acetophenone.

2. Reduce the ketone to CH2 group → benzyl alcohol (using something like LiAlH4).

3. Convert the alcohol to a good leaving group, like a tosylate → benzyl tosylate.

4. Substitute the tosylate with ethoxide via an SN2 reaction → ethoxybenzene.

But that's a four-step process just to add ethoxy, which might be feasible.

But looking at the options, I don't see such a long sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires strong activating groups. For example, if we have a nitro group in a position that makes the ring electron-deficient, but that's not helpful for adding another group.

Alternatively, maybe using a directing group like a methyl group, then adding the ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline (aminobenzene).

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl group added to aniline. Since aniline is a strong activating group, the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the amino group. Let's say position 4 (para).

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the ring again. Now, the ring has amino at 1 and tert-butyl at 4. The amino group is ortho/para director. So the nitro group would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho to amino) or position 4 (but already occupied) or position 5 (para to amino). So it might go to position 3, but that's not directly ortho or para to amino. Wait, no, position 3 is meta to amino.

Hmm, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the second nitration would go para to the amino group (position 4, which is already occupied), but that's not possible. So perhaps the second nitration would go to position 2 or 6. Let's say position 2.

So now substituents are at 1 (amino), 2 (nitro), and 4 (tert-butyl).

But the target has nitro at 3, not 2.

Hmm, this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs at position 3. But why would it?

Wait, after having amino at 1 and tert-butyl at 4, would the nitration occur at position 3? Because position 3 is meta to amino and ortho to tert-butyl.

But I'm not sure. The amino group is a strong activating group, so nitration would be directed by it, not the tert-butyl.

So, the nitro group would go ortho or para to amino, which are positions 2, 4, or 6. But position 4 is already taken by tert-butyl, so nitro would go to 2 or 6.

But the target has nitro at 3, so this approach doesn't work.

Perhaps option D is not the right sequence.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate added. Now, the ring has a sulfonic acid group (position 2, perhaps), making it highly deactivating and meta-directing.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added. Since the ring is deactivating, nitration would be difficult but possible.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this option is unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the ethoxy group addition again.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after making a leaving group on the benzene ring. But benzene isn't nucleophilic. Unless we have a ring-opening, but that's not feasible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction. But Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups, not benzene rings.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substituted benzene with a leaving group. For example, if I have a benzene ring with a nitro group, which is a meta director, and a leaving group (like a tosylate) at position 2. Then, substituting the tosylate with an ethoxy group.

But how to get the nitro and the leaving group in the correct positions.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option B: after adding tert-butyl, then nitrate. Then Fe/HCl (reducing nitro to amine). Then nitrate again, which doesn't make sense because the amine is activating, and nitration would be easy, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are adding substituents in a way that each new group is directed by the existing groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position.

3. Add ethoxy group.

But how?

Wait, after adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated. Adding nitro would be difficult because tert-butyl is activating, but nitration is a strong reaction. Once nitro is added, the ring becomes deactivating.

But where would the nitro go? Ortho or para to tert-butyl.

So, if tert-butyl is at position 1, nitro could be at 2 or 4.

Then, adding ethoxy. Since nitro is deactivating and meta-directing, and tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para-directing, which would dominate?

Wait, in the presence of both groups, the nitro group (deactivating) would dominate, making the ring less reactive. So the ethoxy would have to go where it's directed by the nitro group, which is meta to nitro.

Hmm, that might not lead to the desired position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method when the ring is more activated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added before the nitro group. Let me outline:

1. Add tert-butyl to benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Add ethoxy to tert-butylbenzene → ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Assuming it goes ortho, position 2.

Now, the ring has tert-butyl at 1 and ethoxy at 2.

3. Nitrate the ring. The directing groups are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So the nitro group would go to a position that is ortho or para to either substituent.

In this case, ethoxy is at 2, tert-butyl at 1. So possible positions for nitro would be 3 (ortho to ethoxy), 4 (para to ethoxy), 3 (ortho to tert-butyl), or 6 (para to tert-butyl).

But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 2) and tert-butyl is at 1. So that fits.

So the steps would be:

i) Add tert-butyl → position 1.

ii) Add ethoxy → position 2.

iii) Nitrate → position 3.

But how to add ethoxy to tert-butylbenzene.

Wait, adding ethoxy to tert-butylbenzene. How is that done?

Perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps via electrophilic substitution. Wait, tert-butylbenzene is already activated, so adding ethoxy via electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but how? To add an ethoxy group, maybe using ethanol with a strong acid catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but that's for adding acyl groups.

Wait, perhaps using a different approach. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) nitrate → nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → position 1 has amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl. Since amine is ortho/para director, tert-butyl could go to position 2 or 4.

Assuming position 2.

iv) nitrate → nitro group added. Now, the ring has amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

The amine is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur ortho (2 and 4) or para (5 or 3?) to the amine.

Wait, position 1 has amine, so para would be position 4, which is empty.

So nitro could go to position 4. But in the target, nitro is at position 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second nitration step in option D adds the nitro group at position 3, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps after steps i, ii, iii, the ring has amine at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Now, when nitrated, the amine directs to ortho (position 3 and position 2, but 2 is taken) and para (position 4). So nitro would go to position 3 or 4.

Wait, position 3 is meta to the tert-butyl, but ortho to the amine. So perhaps the nitro group would go to position 3, which is ortho to the amine and meta to the tert-butyl.

That would fit the target structure: amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

But wait, in the target, the substituents are ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the amine isn't present in the target. Therefore, this approach must be wrong.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group, not an amine. So perhaps the nitro group remains as is.

Wait, in option D, step iv is another nitration, but after step ii, we have an amine. Then, perhaps the nitration step adds a nitro group, but why would we want that? Because we already have a nitro group initially.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after creating a leaving group. For example, if I have a benzene ring with a nitro group, which is a meta director, and a leaving group like chloride in a position that can be substituted with ethoxide.

But that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activating group, which benzene doesn't have.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

Looking at option B: steps include adding tert-butyl, then nitrate, then Fe/HCl (which would reduce nitro to amine), then nitrate again, which seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps option C:

i) tert-butyl → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) sulfonate → adds -SO3H group, making the ring strongly deactivating.

iii) nitrate → adds nitro group. Now, the ring is deactivating, so nitration is difficult but possible. The nitro would be added meta to the sulfonate group.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group, so this option is unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the steps differently. Let me try to outline the correct steps again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

I think the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → ortho to ethoxy.

3. Nitrate → adds nitro at position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution. For that, I need a leaving group on the benzene ring. But benzene doesn't have one. So perhaps a better approach is to use a directing group.

Wait, another idea: perhaps using a benzene ring with a nitro group, which is a meta director, and adding ethoxy in a position that's activated.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1).

2. Add ethoxy via a substitution where? Nitro is deactivating, so adding ethoxy would be difficult. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add ethyl group, then converting it to ethoxy.

But Friedel-Crafts of ethyl chloride on benzene would add an ethyl group. Then, converting that to ethoxy would require some reaction, perhaps oxidizing the ethyl group to a ketone, then reducing it to an alcohol, then tosylating, then substituting with ethoxide. That seems complicated, but perhaps it's the way.

But looking at the options, I don't see such a sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution using a tosylate. For example, benzene is first nitrated, then the nitro group is reduced to amine, then the amine is converted to a leaving group, perhaps with tosyl chloride, then substituted with ethoxide.

Wait, let's outline that:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Convert amine to a tosyl group → benzene with tosyl group at position 1.

4. Substitute tosyl group with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

5. Add tert-butyl group → ortho or para to ethoxy.

6. Nitrate → add nitro group.

But that's a lot of steps, and I don't see such a sequence in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, let me think about option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. Now, aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl → adds tert-butyl. Since aniline is ortho/para director, tert-butyl goes to position 2 or 4.

Assuming position 2.

iv) Nitrate → nitro group added. Now, the ring has amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

The amine is a strong activating group, so nitration occurs ortho (position 3 and 2) or para (position 4 or 6). But position 2 is already taken. So nitro could go to position 3 or 4.

Assuming it goes to position 3.

Then, the substituents are at positions 1 (amine), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

But the target has ethoxy at 1, not amine. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the steps.

Wait, perhaps after nitrating, I can convert the nitro group to an ethoxy group. But that doesn't make sense because nitro groups are deactivating and not easily converted to ethers.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the nitro group, I reduce it to amine and then substitute it with ethoxy. But that might require several steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is introduced. But that seems unlikely.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should go back to the options and see which sequence ends up with the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Looking at option B:

Steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added. Where? Ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say position 2.

Now, substituents are tert-butyl at 1 and nitro at 2.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. Now, substituents are tert-butyl at 1 and amine at 2.

iv) nitrate → nitro group added. Amine is strong activating, so nitro would go ortho or para to amine. Ortho positions are 1 (taken by tert-butyl) and 3. Para would be position 5.

So nitro could go to 3 or 5.

If it goes to 3, the substituents are tert-butyl at 1, amine at 2, nitro at 3.

But the target doesn't have an amine. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the nitro group is added. But I don't see a way to do that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution using a base like NaOH and EtBr, which is present in some options.

Looking at option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr, which is for substitution reactions, like SN2. So perhaps after creating a good leaving group, such as a tosylate, the ethoxy group is introduced.

But when would the leaving group be present?

Perhaps after adding a nitro group, which is a meta director, and then converting it to a good leaving group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the leaving group is introduced via a diazonium salt. For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize aniline → aryl diazonium salt.

4. Hydrolyze diazonium salt to a nitro group (but that doesn't help), or substitute with another group like Cl or Br.

Wait, perhaps using a diazonium salt to substitute a leaving group. For example, converting an amino group to a nitro group via diazotization and then hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making the benzene ring have a leaving group. But again, this seems complicated.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Given the target molecule and the options, the correct sequence probably involves adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy (if possible), and then nitro. But since I can't figure out how to add ethoxy to benzene, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, looking back, option D's steps:

i) nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl.

iv) nitrate → add another nitro.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O/heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, perhaps this is a long way to introduce the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3. If I can find an option where nitro is added at position 3 relative to the other substituents.

Option B: after adding tert-butyl and nitrating, the nitro is at position 2. Then, Fe/HCl reduces it to amine.

Then, another nitration would add nitro at position 3.

Wait, perhaps after that, the steps would involve substituting the amine with ethoxy.

But I don't see such steps in option B. Option B's steps are:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 2.

iii) Fe/HCl → amine at 2.

iv) nitrate → maybe at 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps after step iv, we have nitro at 3. Then, step v is diazotization, which requires an amine. So perhaps after step iii, we have aniline, then step iv is another nitration, which adds nitro at 3.

Then, step v: diazotization (make diazonium salt).

Step vi: hydrolysis → perhaps makes a hydroxyl group.

Step vii: NaOH/EtBr → perhaps substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence adds the substituents correctly. Let me imagine:

After step i: tert-butyl at 1.

Step ii: nitro at 2.

Step iii: Fe/HCl → amine at 2.

Step iv: nitrate → nitro at 3.

Now, the substituents are at 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (amine), 3 (nitro).

Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → converts amine to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis of diazonium to produce a hydroxyl group at position 2.

Now, substituents are at 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (OH), 3 (nitro).

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr → substitution reaction. Since the ring has OH, perhaps it's converted to OEt via Williamson ether synthesis. But in this case, position 2 has OH, which is activated. So, with NaOH and EtBr, perhaps substituting the OH with OEt.

So after step vii, substituents are at 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (OEt), 3 (nitro). Which matches the target: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro.

Wait, no, in the target, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. But in this scenario, tert-butyl is at 1, ethoxy at 2, nitro at 3. So the numbering is different. So that doesn't match.

Ah, but perhaps the numbering is arbitrary in the question. Because when you have substituents, the numbering is according to IUPAC rules, which gives the lowest possible numbers. So in the target, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. But in option B's scenario, after step vii, it's ethoxy at 2, tert-butyl at 1, nitro at 3. So numbering would adjust to give the lowest numbers. So the ethoxy would be at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, but in that case, the numbering would be:

Position 1: ethoxy.

Position 2: tert-butyl.

Position 3: nitro.

Which matches the target structure.

So, in that case, option B's sequence would lead to the correct product.

Let me outline the steps again:

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene. Position 1: tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrates. Since tert-butyl is ortho/para director, nitro goes to position 2.

Now, substituents at 1 (tert-butyl) and 2 (nitro).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. Now, substituents at 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (amine).

iv) HNO3 → nitrates again. Amine is ortho/para director, so nitro could go to position 3 (ortho to amine) or position 4 (para to amine). But position 4 may be meta to tert-butyl.

But since the ring has two substituents, the strongest director would be the amine, which is strong activating. So nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to amine), which is also meta to tert-butyl.

Now, substituents: 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (amine), 3 (nitro).

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotizes the amine to form diazonium salt.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolyzes diazonium salt to introduce a hydroxyl group at position 2.

Now, substituents: 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (OH), 3 (nitro).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitutes the OH with OEt. Now, substituents: 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (OEt), 3 (nitro).

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonates, but wait, the target doesn't have a sulfonate group. So perhaps this step is not needed, but in option B, step viii is SO3. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but in option B, step viii is SO3, which adds a sulfonate group. That would add another substituent, which isn't present in the target. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine option B's steps.

Option B steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) nitrate.

v) NaNO2/HCl.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) SO3.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, after step vii, substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (OEt), 3 (nitro). Then step viii adds SO3, which would add a sulfonate group. So the target would have four substituents, which is incorrect.

So option B isn't correct.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The target requires the nitro group to be in the correct position relative to the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups. Based on the options, the correct sequence probably involves adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. But I can't see an option that does this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, looking at option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) tert-butyl → adds to position 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) nitrate → nitro at position 3 (ortho to amine).

v) NaNO2 → diazonium at position 3.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitute.

Hmm, perhaps after step ix, the nitro is replaced with ethoxy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident.

After much consideration, I think the correct option is option D. But I'm not fully certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
- Includes sulfonation (SO₃/H₂SO₄), which introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H). However, the target molecule does not have this group, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
- Sequence: tert-butyl chloride → nitration → Fe/HCl (reduction) → nitration → NaNO₂/HCl → hydrolysis → NaOH/EtBr → sulfonation → dilute H₂SO₄.
- After adding tert-butyl and nitro groups, the sequence reduces the nitro group to an amine, nitrates again, and introduces a hydroxyl group via diazotization and hydrolysis. Substitution with ethoxy occurs in step vii. However, the final step (sulfonation) introduces an additional group (-SO₃H) not present in the target, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
- Sequence: tert-butyl chloride → sulfonation → nitration → Fe/HCl → NaNO₂/HCl → nitration → hydrolysis → dilute H₂SO₄ → NaOH/EtBr.
- Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H), which is not part of the target molecule. This makes the option incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
- Sequence: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Fe/HCl → tert-butyl chloride → HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → NaNO₂/HCl → SO₃/H₂SO₄ → dilute H₂SO₄ → H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → NaOH/EtBr.
- After nitration and reduction, tert-butyl is added, followed by further nitration. The sequence then involves diazotization, sulfonation, and substitution. However, the introduction of a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) in step vi makes this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
None of the options perfectly match the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** comes closest to the desired sequence, despite the inclusion of an extraneous sulfonation step.

Answer: D
