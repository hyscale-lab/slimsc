Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, but wait, wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Or wait, maybe it's the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Oh right, so the photon's energy has to match the energy difference between these two states.

First, I need to figure out what the possible transitions are. In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels include both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, a diatomic molecule's energy is usually treated as having vibrational and rotational parts. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, v=0, and the ground rotational state, which is the lowest rotation state, typically J=0 or J=1, depending on the model. Wait, no, for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but in a non-rigid rotor, maybe it's more complex? Or perhaps this model is considering both vibration and rotation. 

Wait, the question is about the molecule being in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest energy state, so that's v=0 and J=0. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact model here. Alternatively, maybe the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, and the molecule is in the ground rotational state.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule goes to the next possible state with the lowest energy. That next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states.

The energy levels for a harmonic oscillator (vibrational) are given by Ev = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. And for rotation, the energy isErot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. So I need to calculate both the vibrational energy difference and the rotational energy difference from the ground state and see which is smaller.

The question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule can absorb a photon that causes it to move either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, and whichever requires the lower photon energy is the option.

Wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That suggests that it's the smallest possible energy transition, so the photon's energy should be the lower of the two possible energy gaps.

So let's calculate both. First, the vibrational energy gap. The fundamental state is v=0, so the next state is v=1. The energy difference would be ΔE_vib = (1 + 1/2) h ν - (0 + 1/2) h ν = h ν.

Then the rotational energy gap. The ground state is J=0, next is J=1. The rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = B [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = B*(2). What's B? B is the rotational constant, which is given by (h/(8π² I c)), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, no, the rotational constant B is often given in terms of energy per unit J(J+1). So B = (h²)/(8π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed using the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency as B = ħ²/(2 I), but I might need to think about the exact formula.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are Erot = B J (J + 1), with B = (ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is B*(2 - 0) = 2B.

So I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot, then see which is smaller. The photon's energy must match the lower of the two, so the molecule can transition to the next possible state with the least energy increase.

So let's compute both.

First, find the vibrational energy difference. Given that the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s, but we need to convert that to frequency ν. Since ω = 2π ν, so ν = ω/(2π) = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.2832) ≈ ~6.366e13 Hz.

Then ΔE_vib = h ν = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (6.366e13 Hz) ≈ let's calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ (6.626 * 6.366) * 1e-21 ≈ approx 42.28e-21 J, which is 4.228e-20 J.

Now for the rotational energy difference. First, calculate the moment of inertia I. I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the masses are 20 and 2. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) amu. 20*2=40, 40/22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I should convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = (40)/(22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. So 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ approx 3.018e0. So 3.018e-27 kg? Wait, wait:

Wait 1.818 * 1.6605 = Let me compute:

1.818 * 1.6605:

1 * 1.6605 = 1.6605

0.8 * 1.6605 = 1.3284

0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.0299

Adding all: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889 + 0.0299 = 3.0188.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Wait, let me compute that again:

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20. So 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = (3.0188 *4) e-(27+20) = 12.0752e-47 = 1.20752e-46 kg m².

Now, B is (ħ²)/(2I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (h/(2π)). So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So B = (ħ²)/(2I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.20752e-46 )

Calculating numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.20752e-46 = 2.41504e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.41504e-46 ≈ approx 4.604e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1.0545718e-34 squared is (1.0545718)^2 = 1.112, so 1.112e-68. Divided by 2.41504e-46:

So 1.112e-68 / 2.41504e-46 = (1.112 / 2.41504) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.415 ≈ approx 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J, which is 4.6e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference ΔE_rot is 2B = 2 * 4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier I found ΔE_vib to be about 4.2e-20 J, which is much larger than 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon should have an energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But wait, wait. The question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, but wait, perhaps the next state is a combination of both. No, typically, when you have a system with multiple degrees of freedom, the next state would correspond to the lowest possible energy increase, which in this case is the rotational transition because it's lower in energy.

So the photon's energy should match ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon such that its energy E_photon = p c = ΔE_rot.

Wait, the energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light (~3e8 m/s). So p = E / c.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.2e-23) / (3e8) N·s.

Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units check out.

Calculating that: 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.0667e-31 N·s. Hmm, but none of the options are this small. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), right? Because the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I). Alternatively, sometimes B is defined as (h c)/(8 π² I), but then the energy would be E_rot = B J (J +1) in terms of cm^-1 or something. Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, let's think again. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = ( ħ² / (2 I) ) J (J + 1). So that's E_rot = B J (J +1), where B = ħ²/(2 I). Alternatively, sometimes B is the rotational constant in terms of energy, so yes, B = ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, but another possibility is that the rotational energy is given in terms of the rotational constant B, which is hbar²/(2I), but sometimes I see B defined as h/(8 pi² I c), which would be in cm^-1 or something. Hmm, perhaps I should use the correct formula for B.

Alternatively, maybe I confused B with another constant. Let me reevaluate.

The moment of inertia I = μ r².

The rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² / (2 I )) J (J + 1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = (ħ²/(2 I)) * 2. So ΔE_rot = 2 * (ħ²/(2 I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, because 2B where B is (ħ²/(2 I)), so 2B would be (ħ²)/(I).

Wait, yes, that's correct. So let me recalculate B.

Oh, I see, earlier I computed B as (ħ²)/(2 I), which is correct, so the energy difference is 2B, which is (ħ²)/(I).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Let's recompute I.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = (40)/(22) = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So, ħ² / (2 I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2072e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (approx 1.112) * 1e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2072e-46 = 2.4144e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.4144e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

So the ΔE_rot is 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy needs to match this, so E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

But the photon's momentum p is related to its energy by E = p c, so p = E/c.

So p = 9.214e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.214 / 3) * 1e-31 kg m/s.

9.214 /3 ≈ 3.071, so p ≈ 3.071e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 kg·m/s
Option B: 2.3e-27 kg·m/s
Option C: 1.1e-27 kg·m/s
Option D: 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, 3.07e-31 is way smaller than any of the options. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor in the energy levels. Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the vibrational energy as the main transition, but that would require a bigger photon energy, which would match option B, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the transition is vibrational or rotational. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0 for a rigid rotor). But in some models, the rotor model starts at J=0, but the vibrational is separate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the next state is the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), or the first excited rotational state (v=0, J=1). So the energy difference would be either the vibrational or rotational.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational. So the photon's energy should be in the microwave region, corresponding to the rotational transition.

But the options given are much larger than what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, maybe I should re-express B in terms of w, the angular frequency of vibration.

No, because the rotational energy is independent of the vibrational frequency. So I think the approach is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, let me compute ħ²/(2I) more accurately.

ħ = hbar = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68 J²·s².

I = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2072e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4144e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

So B is 4.607e-23 J.

Then, the energy difference is 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.214e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

So 9.214e-23 / 3e8 = 3.071e-31 kg m/s.

But this is nowhere near any of the options given. Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, Ns is kg·m/s, so the options are in kg·m/s.

My calculated p is about 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, but the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28, which is about 45 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is being treated as a non-rigid rotor, which implies that the bond length isn't fixed. But wait, the question says it's a diatomic modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. Oh, maybe in this model, the rotational and vibrational energies are treated together. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both, and the transition could be from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be J=1 in v=0, or v=1 and J=0, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

But if my calculation is correct, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s. None of the options are anywhere near this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering that the molecule is in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, but the transition is to the next state, which could be a combination of both.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is in the vibrational ground state but the rotational ground state (J=0), and the next state is the first excited rotational state (J=1), which would require energy ΔE_rot = B*(2) = 9.2e-23 J as before.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the first vibrational excited state, but that would require a much higher energy, which isn't matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reduced mass again. Let me check that.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converting 1.818 amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg, so 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg. That seems right.

Bond length r = 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So ΔE_rot is 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.214e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which in the rotation-vibration model could be a combination of both. But that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0), and the next energy level is the J=1 state, which requires absorbing a photon of energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same calculation, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy, which is much larger, and then the photon's energy would match the vibrational transition. Let me compute that.

So the vibrational frequency is w = 4e14 rad/s. The photon's energy is E_photon = h ν, where ν = w/(2π).

So ν = 4e14 / (2π) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

E_photon = h ν = 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.366e13 Hz ≈ 4.227e-20 J.

Then, p_photon = E/c = 4.227e-20 / 3e8 = 1.409e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, that matches option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon have to match the higher vibrational energy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which transition is possible. Maybe in the model, the molecule can only undergo a vibrational transition if the rotational state is also changed. But that's getting into selection rules.

Wait, in the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator model, the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = 0, ±1. So a photon can cause a transition where the vibrational state changes and the rotational state can change by ±1 or stay the same.

But in the question, we're considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest state. The next possible state could be either:

- v=1, J=0: which would require a photon of energy ΔE_vib = h ν.

- v=0, J=1: which would require a photon of energy ΔE_rot = 2B.

Which of these is lower in energy? Let me compute the numerical values.

Earlier, I found ΔE_rot = 9.214e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = 4.227e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot is much smaller than ΔE_vib, so the photon should have energy corresponding to ΔE_rot.

But according to the options, the only one that matches the vibrational energy is option D, which is 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, 1.4e-28 kg·m/s is E/c for 4.2e-20 J, which is the vibrational transition.

But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition is much lower in energy and should be the next possible state. So why isn't there an option matching that?

Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B and ΔE_rot.

Wait, let me recompute B.

B = (ħ²)/(2I)

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2072e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4144e-46 ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Then, photon's energy is 9.214e-23 J, so p = E/c = 9.214e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But since none of the options are close, perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational one.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, and the next state after the ground state is the first vibrational state, v=1, J=0. But earlier, I found that the vibrational energy is much higher than the rotational. So why would the molecule transition to the vibrational state if the rotational is lower in energy?

Unless the model doesn't allow for separate rotational transitions, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecular Hamiltonian includes both rotational and vibrational energies, and the next state is the one where the total energy is the next higher, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energies of both possible transitions and see which is smaller. The molecule will transition to the state with the smallest energy difference.

So, which is smaller, 9.2e-23 J (rotational) or 4.2e-20 J (vibrational)? 9.2e-23 is much smaller, so the rotational transition is possible. But since the options don't include this value, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon to have energy equal to the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions? No, that wouldn't make sense because the question states it's the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy difference. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is (1*2 -0) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So, E = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2072e-46.

Wait, let me compute that:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

Divided by 1.2072e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 ≈ 9.214e-23 J.

Which is the same result as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, but this isn't one of the options. So maybe I made a miscalculation, perhaps in the initial calculation of B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibration-rotation state, which would be a combination of both, but that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the next state after the ground state is the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational state, whichever requires the least energy. But according to our calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy should match that.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps there's an error in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next possible state in the vibration-rotation spectrum, which would be a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition where both v and J change. For example, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon's energy to match the vibrational transition. Alternatively, (v=0, J=1), which requires the rotational transition.

Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the photon's energy should match that. But if the options don't include that, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the option D is 1.4e-28 kg·m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. Let me check that.

E_photon = 4.2e-20 J.

p_photon = E/c = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s. That's option D.

So perhaps the question expects the photon to have energy corresponding to the vibrational transition.

Wait, but why would the molecule transition to a higher vibrational state when a lower rotational transition is possible. Unless perhaps the model doesn't allow for rotational transitions, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which doesn't have a fixed bond length, so the rotational energy levels are different. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B by a factor. Let me think: the rotational energy is sometimes expressed in terms of the rotational constant in cm^-1, which is B_rot = h/(8 pi^2 I c). Let me compute that and see if that changes anything.

Wait, B_rot (in cm^-1) is h/(8 pi² I c).

Compute that: h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

I = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

c = 3e8 m/s.

So B_rot = (6.626e-34) / (8 * pi² * 1.2072e-46 * 3e8).

Compute denominator: 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2072e-46 * 3e8.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

1.2072e-46 *3e8 = 3.6216e-38.

So denominator is 78.9568 * 3.6216e-38 ≈ 285.53e-38 = 2.8553e-36.

So B_rot = 6.626e-34 / 2.8553e-36 ≈ approx 2319 cm^-1.

Wait, that's a rotational constant in wavenumbers. Then, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = h c B_rot J (J+1) = hc B_rot J (J+1).

So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot = hc B_rot (2 -0) = 2 hc B_rot.

But hc is 12400 eV·Å, but perhaps in J:

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E_rot = 2 * 1.9878e-25 J·m * 2319 cm^-1.

Wait, wait, because B_rot is in cm^-1, and when multiplied by J, which is 1/m, it gives energy in J.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me compute it correctly.

B_rot = 2319 cm^-1 = 2319 / 100 = 23.19 m^-1.

So E_rot = 2 * h c * B_rot.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So E_rot = 2 * 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 23.19.

Compute that: 2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 = 3.9756e-25.

Multiply by 23.19: 3.9756e-25 * 23.19 ≈ 9.22e-24 J.

Wait, that's the same as the previous calculation of 9.214e-23 J. Wait, no, because 9.22e-24 is 9.22e-24 J, which is 0.922e-23 J. That's less than the earlier value. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B_rot in cm^-1.

Wait, let me recompute B_rot:

B_rot = h/(8 pi² I c).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

I =1.2072e-46 kg m².

c=3e8 m/s.

So denominator =8 * pi^2 * I * c =8 * (pi^2) *1.2072e-46 *3e8.

Compute 8 * pi^2: 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

1.2072e-46 *3e8 = 3.6216e-38.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 * 3.6216e-38 ≈ 285.5e-38 = 2.855e-36.

So denominator is 2.855e-36.

So B_rot =6.626e-34 / 2.855e-36 ≈2319 cm^-1.

Then, E_rot = 2 * h c B_rot = 2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *2319.

Compute step by step:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *2319 = 4.617e-22.

Multiply by 2:9.234e-22 J.

Wait, that's 9.234e-22 J, which is about 10 times larger than my previous calculation. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used earlier was wrong. Let me go back.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = ħ²/(I).

Earlier, ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

I =1.2072e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2072e-46.

Compute numerator: 1.0545718e-34 squared is approx 1.112e-68.

So E_rot =1.112e-68 /1.2072e-46 ≈9.214e-23 J.

But when I used the B_rot in cm^-1, the calculation gave me E_rot =9.234e-22 J, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should express B_rot in terms of energy per J(J+1) in Joules.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial calculation, leading to p_photon =3.07e-31 kg·m/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition.

But the only option that matches the vibrational transition is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns (kg·m/s).

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but why would the molecule transition via the vibrational route when a lower-energy rotational transition is possible? Maybe because the selection rules don't allow rotational transitions without vibrational changes.

Ah, selection rules in rotation-vibration spectra: in the pure rotational spectrum, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±2 (for diatomic molecules), but wait, no, that's for electric dipole transitions. Wait, diatomic molecules have a permanent dipole moment, so pure rotational transitions are allowed with ΔJ = ±1.

Wait, no, the selection rule for pure rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1. But in the presence of vibration, rotational transitions can have ΔJ = ±1 or ±2, perhaps. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of the vibration (v=0), and the next state is the first vibration state (v=1), which would require a photon of vibrational energy.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the photon's momentum as 1.4e-28 kg·m/s, which is option D.

But I'm still confused why the rotational transition isn't considered. Maybe the problem expects the vibrational transition, despite the higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options don't include the correct answer, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem treats the molecule as a harmonic oscillator and ignores the rotational degrees of freedom. But the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which should include both.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option D, 1.4e-28 kg·m/s, as that's the only option that matches the vibrational transition.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon that causes the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \text{where } \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.607 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Rotational Energy Difference**:
   The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.607 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 9.214 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Vibrational Energy Difference**:
   The vibrational energy difference between \( v=0 \) and \( v=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu, \quad \text{where } \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.227 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Analysis of Transitions:
- The rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.214 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.227 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)).
- However, none of the provided options match the calculated rotational momentum:
  \[
  p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.214 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
  \]
- The only option that matches the vibrational transition is **Option D**, which corresponds to:
  \[
  p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.227 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
  \]

### Conclusion:
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options suggest that the problem expects the photon to match the vibrational energy difference. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
