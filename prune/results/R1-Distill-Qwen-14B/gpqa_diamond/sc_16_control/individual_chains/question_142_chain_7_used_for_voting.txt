Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, it's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that the density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, in this case, since the states |0> and |1> are orthonormal, maybe this is a mixed state of those two with equal probabilities.

I think the density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (ρ²=ρ), but here, since it's a mixture of two orthogonal states with equal weights, it's probably a mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Wait, qubit space is two-dimensional, right? Because a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrices live in a four-dimensional space (since a 2x2 density matrix has four elements), but when considering their representation in terms of Bloch vectors, it's in 3D space because the Bloch sphere is three-dimensional. Oh wait, no, the Bloch sphere is for a single qubit, which is a two-dimensional space but represented in 3D because it's on the surface of a sphere.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position here? I think the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere or in the Bloch ball. For a pure state, it's on the surface (the Bloch sphere), and for a mixed state, it's inside the Bloch ball.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write that out. The |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2, you get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So the density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2.

I remember that any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector). So the Bloch vector r determines where on the Bloch sphere the state is located.

Let me recall the expansion. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you write ρ as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2, the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z give the components of the Bloch vector.

So for our given ρ matrix, which is (I)/2. Because ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (I)/2, since |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

Plugging into the general form: (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 plus (r·σ)/2 equals I/2, which means (r·σ)/2 must be zero. So each component of r must be zero. Hence, r = (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but what does that mean? The Bloch vector is at the origin. So the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. That makes sense because when you have equal probabilities for |0> and |1>, the state is completely mixed. So the density matrix is I/2, which is the completely mixed state, and its Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options: Option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state with equal probabilities for the states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). The matrix can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), it is clear that the term \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) must vanish, implying \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). 

This means the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]
