Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable.

The Lagrangian provided is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Hmm, I remember that γ matrices are part of the Dirac algebra, used in describing spin-½ particles like electrons.

First, I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field and term in the Lagrangian. Because the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be [Mass]^4 since it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime (d^4x), and the action is dimensionless.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. That's a key point. So, each term in L_int must have [mass]^4.

Let's break down the components:

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I need to find the mass dimension of each part.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. From what I recall, in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1, and m is mass dimension 1. So, each ψ must have [ψ] = [m]/[∂_μ]^{½} ? Wait, wait, perhaps another approach.

In general, the fields in the Lagrangian must have dimensions such that when multiplied by derivatives and such, the whole term has dimension 4.

Alternatively, I think in 4d spacetime, the dimension of the fields are as follows:
- Scalar fields (like φ) have [φ] = 1.
- Spinor fields (ψ) have [ψ] = 3/2.
- Vector fields (like A_μ) have [A_μ] = 1.

Wait, but wait, the F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each derivative adds a mass dimension of 1, and A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So, [F^{μν}] = [∂ A] = [mass]^1 * [A] = 1 * 1 = 2. Wait, no, actually, each derivative is [mass]^1, so F is ∂ A which is [mass]^1 * [A]^1. Since A has dimension 1, F has dimension 2.

Now, let's look at σ_{μν}. That's (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is a product of two γ matrices. The γ matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So [σ_{μν}] = [γ_μ][γ_ν] = (dimensionless)^2 → dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless.

So, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ, then ψ, then F.

Wait, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ. So each ψ has [ψ] = 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2.

So putting it together:

κ * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]

But wait, the term is a product of four spinors and F, but no, wait, no, wait: the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the product is ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) multiplied by σ (dimensionless), multiplied by ψ (3/2), multiplied by F (dimension 2). So the total dimension for the term without κ is:

3/2 (ψ̄) + 0 (σ) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. Because each term in the Lagrangian is an integrand, which when integrated over d^4x (dimension 4) gives a dimensionless action. So each term must be dimension 4.

So the term without κ is giving a dimension of 5. Therefore, κ must have dimension -1 to bring the total to 4.

So [κ] = 4 - (5) = -1.

So the first part of the question: the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In four-dimensional theories, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension is ≥ 0. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the rule I remember is that a coupling in a term like g φ^n is renormalizable if [g] is positive or zero, because terms with negative mass dimension would lead to higher-dimension operators, which are nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait, another approach: in four dimensions, the dimension of a coupling constant in a term like g O is given by [g] = 4 - [O], where [O] is the dimension of the operator.

If [g] is positive, the term is renormalizable. If [g] is negative, the term is nonrenormalizable.

So for our case, the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ F ψ). The operator is the product of four fields (two ψ's, one ψ̄, and one F, which is built from two A's and derivatives). Or perhaps it's an operator of dimension 5, as calculated before.

Wait, the operator O is ψ̄ σ F ψ. Its dimension is 5, as we found earlier. So [O] =5.

Then, [κ] = 4 - [O] → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. Which is negative.

In four dimensions, a coupling constant with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction is nonrenormalizable. Because the dimension is negative, which would mean that the coupling becomes relevant (but wait, no, negative dimension implies the coupling is irrelevant, or maybe I have that backwards).

Wait, more accurately, for a term L = g O, the term is renormalizable if [g] ≥ 0. Because:

In four dimensions, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in O) + (coupling's dimension).

Wait, perhaps another approach: the renormalizability is determined by the superficial degree of divergence of a Feynman diagram. For a theory to be renormalizable, all 1PI diagrams must be finite, which implies that D ≤ 0 for all diagrams. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4L - (E_p * [p] + E_b [b] + ...), where L is the number of loops, E_p the number of photon lines (or boson lines), and [p] their dimension, etc. But perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, for a term g O, the dimension of the coupling is [g] = 4 - [O]. Wait, let me think. The Lagrangian term is g O, and the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 (since it's integrated over d^4x to make the action dimensionless). So [g O] =4. So [g] =4 - [O].

If [g] is positive, then the term is renormalizable. Because when you have a term with a coupling g, the dimension is [g] =4 - [O]. If [g] is positive, then [O] <4, which makes the term renormalizable.

In our case, [g] (which is κ) is -1. So 4 - [O] = -1 → [O] =5. So [O] is 5, which is greater than 4. Therefore, the term is nonrenormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension.

So, the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The term is in the Lagrangian: L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The dimension of the operator O is [O]=5. So [κ] =4 -5= -1. So since [κ] is negative, the theory is nonrenormalizable. Because for a term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0, which would require [O] ≤4. Here, [O] is 5, so it's nonrenormalizable.

Therefore, the answer for the second part is that the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No, because [κ] is -1 and the theory can't be renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable → [κ] is 1 would mean [O]=4-1=3. But our case is [O]=5. So B is incorrect.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable → Yes, this fits.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable → No, because [κ] is 1 would mean [O]=3, which would be renormalizable.

So the correct option is C: mass dimension -1, theory not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
1. **Dirac spinor $\psi$**: In four-dimensional spacetime, the Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
2. **Adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$**: The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, so $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
3. **Field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$**: The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is defined as $F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu$, where $A^\mu$ is a vector field with $[A^\mu] = 1$. Since derivatives $\partial_\mu$ have mass dimension $1$, $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
4. **$\sigma_{\mu\nu}$**: The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is a commutator of dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension $4$ because the Lagrangian density is integrated over four-dimensional spacetime, and the action is dimensionless. The total dimension of the term without $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
To ensure the entire term has dimension $4$, $\kappa$ must have:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
In four-dimensional spacetime, a theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa] \geq 0$. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, leading to higher-dimension operators that cannot be absorbed into the renormalizable terms.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
