Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and their planets have similar masses. Interesting.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital periods of the planets?

I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for velocity semi-amplitude (K) is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 year)^2 ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) ) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term drops out. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the formula involves the mass of the planet and the mass of the star. 

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )

Wait, no, maybe I should just think in terms of the relation between velocity, period, and the masses.

Alternatively, I recall that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (P)^(1/3), but I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps it's better to use Kepler's third law. The velocity of the star's orbit would relate to the planet's orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that (P^2)(M_*) = (4π²/G)(a^3), where a is the semi-major axis. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is v = (2π a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius. And the planet's velocity is v_p = (2π a_p) / P. From the center of mass condition, M_* a_* = M_p a_p. Since M_* is much larger than M_p (like Sun and Neptune), a_* ≈ (M_p / M_*) a_p.

So the star's velocity is v_* = (2π a_*) / P ≈ (2π (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) a_p ) / P. But since M_* is much larger, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so v_* ≈ (2π M_p a_p )/(M_* P).

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, (a_p)^3 = G M_* (P/(2π))². So a_p = [ (G M_* (P/(2π))² ) ]^(1/3).

Substituting back into v_*:

v_* ≈ (2π M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* (P/(2π))² ) ]^(1/3) ) / P.

Simplify this: Let's compute the exponents.

Let me factor out the terms. Let's write it as:

v_* ≈ (2π M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) (P/(2π))^(2/3) ) ] / P.

So that's (2π M_p / M_*) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * (P^(2/3)) / (2π)^(2/3) ) * (1/P).

Hmm, let's compute each term:

- 2π from first term, (2π)^(-2/3) from the third term: overall (2π)^(1 - 2/3) ) = (2π)^(1/3).

- M_p term: M_p.

- M_* terms: M_*^{-1} * M_*^{1/3} = M_*^{-2/3}.

- P terms: P^(2/3) * P^{-1} = P^{-1/3}.

So putting it all together:

v_* ≈ (2π)^(1/3) * M_p * (G )^(1/3) * M_*^{-2/3} * P^{-1/3}.

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express K (the velocity semi-amplitude) in terms of P.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to relate the Doppler shifts (which are proportional to the velocity) for the two planets.

Given that the stars have the same mass, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune (so M_p1 ≈ M_p2), and the Doppler shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms, which would imply K1 and K2 are in the ratio 5:7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But from the formula for K, which is the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (P)^{-1/3}.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)).

But because the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, since M_* >> M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, perhaps I should just consider the proportionality. Since M_* is the same for both stars, and M_p is similar for both planets, the ratio of their K values should depend on the inverse cube root of their orbital periods.

Wait, let's think about the formula again. The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( (M_*^(2/3) ) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)) )

Wait, let me simplify units. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the proportionality.

The formula for K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) * (1/ P^(1/3) ) * (1/sin i) )

Wait, but given that the inclination i is the same for both (since the shifts are periodic, so i is close to 90 degrees, but it's the same for both), and since M_p1 ≈ M_p2, M_* is same for both, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = k * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = k * (1/P2^(1/3)).

So taking the ratio: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = C * 1/P1^(1/3), K2 = C * 1/P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no, because K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3) ) / (1/P2^(1/3} )) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So if K1 is 5, K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^1/3.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So we have P2 = ( (5/7) )^3 * P1.

Wait wait, no. Let me think.

We have (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7.

Raise both sides to the third power: P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Wait, but that's (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is ~0.364 * P1, which means P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, no, that can't be right because 0.36 is less than one. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is shorter, so the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1 by a factor of ~0.36.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure.

Wait, if K1 = 5 and K2 =7, then K1/K2 =5/7.

So (P2/P1)^(1/3) =5/7 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of about 0.36.

So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1, which is 0.36, so it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have the ratio inverted. Let me reorganize:

We have K = (some constant) * (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3))).

Assuming M_p is same for both planets, and M_* same, then K is inversely proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C.

K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C.

So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3).

Which can be written as (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

So, K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (P2/P1)^(1/3) =5/7.

So P2/P1= (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Which means P2 is about 0.364 times P1, so P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.364, so it's 0.36 times longer than P1. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 0.36 times longer implies that P2 is longer than P1, but here it's shorter. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backward. Let me think again.

If K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then K1 is smaller than K2. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a smaller K implies a larger P. Because if K is small, then P must be large.

So if K1 < K2 → P1 > P2.

So P2 is smaller than P1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is shorter, so the ratio is less than 1.

The options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So 0.36 is the ratio P2/P1, which is shorter. So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think in terms of actual numbers.

Suppose if P2 were equal to P1, then K1 and K2 would be the same. But since K2 is larger than K1, that would mean that for P2, K is larger, so P2 must be smaller than P1.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So a higher K means a smaller P.

So, with K2 being larger, P2 is smaller.

The question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1?

So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's about 0.36 times longer. So the answer is A.

But wait, sometimes when I'm confused, I might have messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would be better. Let's consider the formula again.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But since M_* >> M_p, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula as:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) P ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π)^(-1/3) )

But maybe I should just look for the relation between K and P.

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ P^(-1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Thus, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet through the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This means that \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. For two planets, the ratio of their velocity semi-amplitudes is given by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means that planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of ~0.36.

Given the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately **0.36**.
