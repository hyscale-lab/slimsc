Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves a state vector and some operator, and I need to find probabilities and the average value. Alright, let's take it step by step.

The state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so I guess I need to normalize it first. Because the probabilities have to add up to one. So first, I'll probably have to calculate the normalization factor.

The operator's matrix is A with elements Aij. Aij is hbar/2 when i is different from j, and zero otherwise. So the matrix looks like a 2x2 matrix. For a two-level system, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i is different from j, the element is non-zero. So for i=1, j=2 and vice versa. So diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2. So this is like a spin-flip operator or something. But wait, what operator has off-diagonal elements like this? Oh, maybe the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], right. So A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

But the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. Oh wait, the operator is given, and we are to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So we need to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, maybe we can find the eigenvectors.

Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So for matrix A:

| -λ    ħ/2 |
| ħ/2   -λ |

The determinant is (λ^2) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ²/4) → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors. For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0 → 

[ [ -ħ/2 , ħ/2 ], 
  [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ] 

The equations:
-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0 → 

[ [ ħ/2 , ħ/2 ], 
  [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ]

The equations:
(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1) up to a scalar.

Wait, but these eigenvectors presumably form an orthonormal basis? Let's check.

The eigenvectors are |+> = (1,1)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (1,-1)/sqrt(2). Because they should be normalized. Because the state vectors should have unit length.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> and |-> as defined.

But wait, the given state |alpha> is in the up/down basis. We need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, which is |+> and |->.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this differently. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, and we're to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+> and |->, and the coefficients would give the probabilities.

But first, let's normalize |alpha>.

The state is |alpha> = k [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

We need to find k such that <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Compute the inner product:

k^2 [ (1 - i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) ].

Wait, wait no. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 -i). So the inner product is (1+i)(1 -i) + (2 -i)(2 +i).

Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - (i)^2 = 4 +0i +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So k^2 *7 =1 → k = 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

We can write |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

But |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So let's plug that into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (|up> + |down>) + (|up> - |down> ) * ( (2 - i) - (1+i) ) / (1+i + 2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7) ] Hmm, maybe a better approach is to express |alpha> as a combination of |+> and |->.

Let me think: |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, |alpha> = a|+> + b|->.

Express this as:

( a/sqrt(2) + b/sqrt(2) ) |up> + ( a/sqrt(2) - b/sqrt(2) ) |down> )

This should equal to (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, setting the coefficients equal:

a/sqrt(2) + b/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
a/sqrt(2) - b/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me denote these as equations 1 and 2.

Equation 1: (a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1 +i)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me add equations 1 and 2:

(2a)/sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
→ 2a/sqrt(2) = (3) /sqrt(7)
→ a = (3)/(2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(2 sqrt(14)).

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(2b)/sqrt(2) = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
→ 2b/sqrt(2) = (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)
→ b = (-1 + 2i )/( 2 sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, adding equations 1 and 2:

Equation 1 + Equation 2:

[ (a + b) + (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
→ 2a / sqrt(2) = (3) / sqrt(7)
→ a = [3 / sqrt(7)] * [sqrt(2)/2 ] = 3 sqrt(2)/( 2 sqrt(7) ) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

[ (a + b) - (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
→ 2b / sqrt(2) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)
→ b = [ (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7) ] * [ sqrt(2)/2 ] = (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So now, a and b are known. The coefficients for |+> and |-> in |alpha> are a and b.

The probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Let's compute |a|^2 first.

a = 3 sqrt(2)/( 2 sqrt(7) )

So |a|^2 = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. So that's about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, which adds up to 1.

Wait, but let me compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) * 2 ] / (4 *7 )

Which is [ (1 +4) *2 ] / (28) → (5 *2)/(28) = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357. So 0.6428 and 0.357 sum to 1. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

Wait, that's exactly option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

But wait, what's the average value of the operator A?

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is expressed in terms of its eigenstates, and |alpha> is a combination of |+> and |->, the expectation value is the sum of |a|^2 * lambda_+ + |b|^2 * lambda_-, where lambda_+ is ħ/2 and lambda_- is - ħ/2.

So <A> = |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2).

We have |a|^2 =9/14 and |b|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 )
= [9/14 -5/14 ] * ħ/2
= (4/14 ) * ħ/2
= (2/7) * ħ/2
= ħ/(7).

So that matches option A's average value.

Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <A> directly.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

The operator A is (ħ/2) [ [0,1],[1,0] ].

So the expectation value <A> is (1/sqrt(7))² times (1+i, 2 -i) multiplied by A matrix times (1-i, 2+i).

Wait, because <A> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i); (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix product.

Wait, A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0 ]].

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> → in vector form, [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

So to compute <A>:

= (1/sqrt(7))^2 * [ (1 -i) (2 + i) ] * A * [ (1+i); (2 -i) ].

Wait, no. Oh, wait, the expectation value is:

⟨ alpha | A | alpha ⟩ = (1/sqrt(7))² [ (1 - i) (2 + i) ]_{row} * A * [ (1 + i); (2 -i) ]_{col}.

Wait, no, the matrix multiplication is:

⟨ alpha | A | alpha ⟩ = (1/7) * [ (1 - i) (2 + i), ... ] multiplied by A multiplied by [ (1 + i), (2 -i) ]^T.

Wait, more accurately, the vector is a column vector. So, compute A times |alpha>, then take the inner product with <alpha|.

So:

A|alpha> = A * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7)
= [ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1 + i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A | alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [ ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) , ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is the first row vector (conjugate of |alpha>) multiplied by the resulting vector after A is applied.

Wait, the calculation is:

(1/sqrt(7))² * [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ] * [ [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) ], [ (ħ/2)(1 +i) ] ]

Which is (1/7) * [ (1 -i)(ħ/2)(2 - i) + (2 +i)(ħ/2)(1 +i) ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So sum these two:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the expectation value is (1/7) * ( ħ/2 ) * 2 = (1/7)* ħ.

Which is ħ/(7), which matches our earlier result.

So the average value is ħ/7, and probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36). So that's option A.

Wait, option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So that's correct. So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves a quantum state |α⟩ proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation has elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state is given as |α⟩ = k[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩], where k is the normalization constant. To normalize, we compute:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = k^2 \left[(1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)\right].
\]

Calculating the terms:
\[
(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2,
\]
\[
(2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:
\[
k^2 (2 + 5) = 1 \implies k^2 = \frac{1}{7} \implies k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩\right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of A are found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenvectors are:
\[
|+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+⟩ and |−⟩
Expand |α⟩ as:
\[
|α⟩ = c_+|+⟩ + c_-|−⟩.
\]

Substitute the expressions for |+⟩ and |−⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[(c_+ + c_-)|up⟩ + (c_+ - c_-)|down⟩\right].
\]

Comparing coefficients with |α⟩ = \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\), we solve for \(c_+\) and \(c_-\):
\[
c_+ + c_- = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_+ - c_- = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations:
\[
2c_+ = \frac{1+i+2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \implies c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
2c_- = \frac{(1+i)-(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \implies c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities are given by \(|c_+|^2\) and \(|c_-|^2\):
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substitute \(|c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14}\) and \(|c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14}\):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{14} (9 - 5) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). This corresponds to **Option A**.
