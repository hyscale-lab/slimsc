Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, more precisely, the atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So the excitation level is higher there. The energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number of particles in state i, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the excitation level is higher, so the ratio of excited atoms to the lower state is higher in star_1. Let's say for a specific transition, the energy difference is delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as r1 and for star_2 as r2. So, r1 = 2 * r2.

But wait, from the Boltzmann equation, r = (g_i/g_j) exp( - deltaE/(kT) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, because they're the same transition in the same atoms, right? So g_i/g_j is a constant for both stars. Let's call this constant C. So for star_1, r1 = C * exp( - deltaE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, r2 = C * exp( - deltaE/(k T2) ).

So the ratio of r1 to r2 would be (r1/r2) = [C exp(-deltaE/(k T1))] / [C exp(-deltaE/(k T2))] ) = exp( (deltaE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But according to the problem, r1 = 2 r2. So (r1/r2) = 2 = exp( deltaE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = (deltaE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let's rearrange that: ln(2) = (deltaE)/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

So that's (deltaE)/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Hmm, but looking at the options, the equation will involve ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2. Let's see the options.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But that doesn't have the deltaE and k terms. Oh wait, maybe the question is setting up a ratio where other constants are accounted for.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. I know that k (Boltzmann's constant) is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So deltaE is equal to k * something. Let's compute deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting that back into the equation: ln(2) = (1 K) * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

Wait, because deltaE/(k) is 1 K, so (deltaE/(k)) ( T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 ) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that must be the correct equation.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is -deltaE/(k T). So when we take the ratio r1/r2, the exponentials subtract. So:

r1/r2 = exp( [deltaE/(k)] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which comes from:

exp( -deltaE/(k T1) ) / exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( deltaE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which is the same as exp( (deltaE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) )

So yes, when we take ln(2), it becomes (deltaE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), and since deltaE/k is 1, it's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So option D is correct.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
r_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = C \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
r_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = C \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right),
\]

where \(C = \frac{g_i}{g_j}\) is a constant for both stars. The ratio of excitation levels is given as \(r_1 = 2 r_2\), so:

\[
\frac{r_1}{r_2} = 2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
