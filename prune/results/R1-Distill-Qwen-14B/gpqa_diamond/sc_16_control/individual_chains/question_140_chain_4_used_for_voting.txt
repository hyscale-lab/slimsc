Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. I'll try to break down the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That suggests X might be a compound made up of isotopes, maybe like deuterium oxide (D2O) if the heavier isotope is deuterium, but I'm not sure yet.

When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of protons and neutrons? So, the atomic number equals the atomic mass. Let me think: which elements have that? Well, hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but that's not a gas. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But helium is a gas, but under certain conditions. Or maybe it's another element. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. No, wait, but carbon is a solid. Oh wait, maybe it's carbon monoxide or something else? Wait, wait, maybe the gas is CO2? No, that's more complicated.

Wait, the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each atom in W, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So if W is a diatomic molecule, each atom would have n = p. So, possible atoms could be H, He, C, O, etc. But the gas W is probably something like H2, O2, or maybe NH3? No, wait, because H2 has 1 proton each, 0 neutrons in H (if it's protium), so that doesn't make n = p. Unless it's deuterium, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So H2 with deuterium would be D2, but D2 is a gas, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something else. Wait, let me think. If W's molecule has each atom with n=p, then possible atoms could be He (2 protons, 2 neutrons), or carbon-12 (6 each), but wait, carbon is a solid under standard conditions. So maybe W is helium gas (He). But He is a monoatomic gas, right? So the molecule would be He. So each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so n=p. That fits.

Alternatively, another possibility is CO2. Wait, but CO2 has a molecule with 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But the individual atoms: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), and each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So each C in CO2 has n=p (6 each), and each O has 8 each. So the whole molecule would have the same for each atom, but the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, maybe the total number of neutrons equals the total protons in the molecule? Let me read the problem again. Oh, the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, if it's H2O, that wouldn't fit because H has 1p, 0n (if H) and O has 8p, 8n. So total protons would be 2 +8=10, and neutrons 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is CO. Carbon has 6p and 6n (if C-12), oxygen has 8p and 8n (O-16). So each CO molecule would have 14 p and 14 n. So the molecule has 14 each. That fits! But CO is a gas but is a bit toxic. Alternatively, maybe W is CH4? Let's see, C has 6p, 6n; H has 1p,0n. So each CH4 has 6+4=10p, 6+0=6n. Not equal. So that's no good.

Wait, another angle: the gas released when a metal reacts with acid is often H2. So if X is a metal reacting with acid Y (like HCl), producing H2 gas. But H2's atoms have 1p and 1n (if deuterium, but if it's protium, 1p, 0n). So the number of protons and neutrons per atom would be 1 and 0, which aren't equal. So that's a problem. So perhaps W isn't H2.

Wait, other possibilities: when a carbonate reacts with acid, it produces CO2 gas. Let's see, CO2: each molecule has C (6p,6n) and O (8p,8n). So each CO2 molecule has 2 O atoms, so 16p and 16n. So the molecule as a whole has 16 each. So that would fit. So W could be CO2. But wait, the reaction with X and Y would be producing CO2. But I'm not sure what X would be. Maybe X is a carbonate? Hmm, but the problem says X is a substance reacting with Y to release CO2. Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. O2 is diatomic, each O has 8p and 8n (if they are O-16). So each O atom has p=n. So O2 would fit. But when does that happen? If Y is a strong oxidizing agent and X is something that releases O2 upon reaction. Not sure.

Wait, another approach. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0 C, 277 is about 4 C). So B's melting point is about 4 C. What's a substance that melts around there? Maybe something like water (0 C), but that's not 4. Or maybe another compound. Wait, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? No, that's a solid. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G is perhaps a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes to CO2 and something else. But if B is the product of that decomposition, perhaps it's a metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, but heating hydroxides can release water and metal oxides.

Wait, maybe X is sodium carbonate. If Y is an acid, like HCl, then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So W would be CO2. Then, the precipitate G might form if maybe Y is a solution that reacts and produces an insoluble compound. Wait, but in this case, NaCl is soluble. Alternatively, perhaps Y is not an acid but something else.

Wait, the problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. So, a keto acid reacting with X gives a product with two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has a carbonyl group. So, what reaction would a keto acid have with X?

Wait, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It's used in organic chemistry to reduce carbonyl groups. So if X is NaBH4, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, then the reaction would be something like CH3COOH + NaBH4 → maybe CH3CH2OH (ethanol) and NaB(OH)4? Not sure about the exact products, but the product would have more hydrogen, perhaps.

Wait, but the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a diol or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is being reduced. For example, ketone to secondary alcohol. Wait, but acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. So maybe the keto acid is something else, like cyclohexanone (which is a ketone, but not an acid). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce W, G. G is a precipitate, which upon heating gives B with a melting point of ~277 K. So perhaps G is a hydroxide, and heating gives metal oxide and water. But B's melting point is 277 K. Let's think: what has a melting point around that temperature? Water itself has a melting point of 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe something like ice would be 273 K, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe B is something solid that's close to melting. For example, maybe it's a metal like mercury, which has a higher melting point, but that's not 277 K. Alternatively, what if B is sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH is solid at room temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate. Wait, but if G is a carbonate, heating might decompose it to CO2 and the metal oxide. But the melting point of the oxide would vary. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the isotopes. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, maybe X is an isotope-rich compound. For example, X could be D2O (deuterium oxide), where one of the H isotopes is deuterium. So, when D2O reacts with Y, which could be an acid, perhaps. Let's say Y is HCl. Then, the reaction could be D2O + HCl → HCl + something? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: when metals react with strong bases, like Na and water, they produce H2 gas. But that would be a reaction between a metal (X?) and a base (Y?), producing H2. But earlier I thought H2 doesn't fit because the n and p don't match.

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. For example, X could be sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CO2 (W), NaCl, and H2O. The precipitate G would need to form. Wait, but NaCl is soluble. So maybe Y is a different acid or a solution that produces an insoluble salt. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide, and X is a salt that reacts to form a precipitate.

Wait, maybe X is silver nitrate (AgNO3), and Y is sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Then, the reaction would be AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO3. AgCl is a precipitate (G). Then, heating AgCl would decompose into Ag and Cl2 (but I'm not sure about the conditions). But the problem says heating G gives B, which has a melting point of ~277 K.

Wait, the melting point of Ag is around 961°C, which is way higher than 277 K (~4°C). So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. For example, heating Na2CO3 would give Na2O and CO2. But Na2O is a solid, but I'm not sure about its melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is water. But water's melting point is 273 K, and B's is 277 K, which is a bit higher, but maybe including impurities or something.

Wait, let me think of another angle. The problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product has 2 O atoms. Maybe the product is an alcohol with two O's, which is unlikely. Or perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone that has two oxygen atoms? Wait, no, a ketone has a carbonyl group, which is one O.

Wait, another thought: if X is NaBH4 (sodium borohydride), which is a reducing agent. When it reacts with a keto acid, like a carbonyl-containing compound, it reduces the carbonyl to an alcohol. So, for example, if the keto acid is RCOOH, then NaBH4 would reduce it to RCH2OH. Wait, but RCOOH would have two O's in the COOH group, and the product would have one O (from the alcohol). So that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the product has two O atoms from somewhere else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a condensation reaction. For example, if the keto acid is something like ethyl acetoacetate (a β-keto acid), and X is a compound that facilitates a Claisen or similar condensation, forming a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, which has two OH groups. But that would involve two O atoms. So, if the keto acid is something like cyclohexanone (but that's not an acid), and X is a reducing agent adding two hydroxyl groups. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol, which has a double bond adjacent to an OH group. That would have two O atoms? No, just one O in the OH.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the initial reaction again.

Substance X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. G when heated gives B, which melts at ~277 K.

If W is CO2, then the reaction could be a carbonate reacting with an acid, producing CO2, water, and a salt. But then, G would be the salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. For example, if X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. The reaction produces NaCl (soluble), so no precipitate. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2 and X is Na2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate. But I'm not sure about the gas.

Wait, another angle. The problem says that when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. So perhaps X is a compound that when added to Y (a solution) forms an insoluble product.

Another thought: perhaps X is a metal carbonate, Y is a strong acid, producing CO2 gas, and the salt is insoluble, so G is the precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3, Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Maybe X is a hydroxide. For instance, if X is NaOH, and Y is a metal carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and the corresponding salt. But again, the product might not form a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. NaHCO3 reacts with HCl to produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the isotopes again. X has a heavier isotope of one element. So, perhaps X is a heavy water compound, like D2O, which is known as a reagent in organic chemistry. So, when D2O reacts with something, perhaps it's an acid (like HCl). The reaction might produce H2 gas? Wait, D2O + HCl would not react violently. Maybe it's a different acid or base.

Wait, another possibility: X is a peroxide, like H2O2. But it's not clear.

Wait, the question also says that the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is a compound where the keto acid has lost two oxygens. Or maybe the product is something like an ether, which has two oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, which has two OH groups, hence two O atoms. But how would that happen?

Wait, going back to the initial reaction: when X reacts with Y, gas W is released. If W is CO2, Y could be a carbonate reacting with an acid. But then, the precipitate G would be something else. Alternatively, perhaps W is NH3. If X is ammonium carbonate and Y is an acid, then CO2 and NH3 would be produced. But that's speculative.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to identify the elements in X.

The question asks to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X, considering all isotopes.

So, I need to find the elements in X, their lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their atomic masses.

Wait, for example, if X has two elements, say, H and O. The lightest isotopes would be H (protium, 1) and O (O-16, 16). The heaviest isotopes (if any) would perhaps be O-18. So, the sum would be 1 + 18 = 19. But the options don't have 19. Hmm.

Wait, let's think of X as something else. Suppose X is a compound containing Na and Cl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH. When NaOH reacts with a carbonate, it would produce CO2, but then the precipitate would be a metal hydroxide? Not sure.

Wait, the problem says that the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point around there? Ice melts at 273 K, which is 0 C. So 277 K is 4 C. Hmm, maybe B is water? Or perhaps a different compound.

Wait, another thought: B could be ammonium chloride. Wait, no, the melting point of ammonium chloride is higher. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal that has a low melting point. For example, mercury melts at around -39 C, which is way lower than 4 C. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound, like sodium nitrate. Sodium nitrate is a solid with a melting point around 328°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for more clues.

The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is a molecule with two O atoms. Let's think of possible products.

If X is a reducing agent, like NaBH4, and the keto acid is something like benzaldehyde (but that's a ketone, not an acid). Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like cyclohexanone carboxylic acid. When reduced, perhaps it forms a secondary alcohol. So, for example, RCOOH → RCH2OH. Wait, but that would reduce the number of O's. The keto acid has two O's (COOH has two O's: one in CO and one in OH). The product would be RCH2OH, which has one O. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an ester or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the product of the keto acid and X has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something with two O's. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone again, but that would mean X is an oxidizing agent, which might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether, which has two O's. But how would that come from a keto acid and X?

I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think of possible candidates for X.

The question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, possible X could be a boron compound, like NaBH4 (sodium borohydride), which is a common reducing agent. Or maybe it's something else like D2O, which is used in certain reactions to exchange isotopes.

If X is NaBH4, then when it reacts with a keto acid, it reduces the carbonyl group. For example, a carboxylic acid would be reduced to a primary alcohol. So, the product would have one O (from the alcohol), but the starting material had two O's (COOH). So the product would have one O, but the question says the product has 2 O's. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, but wait: maybe the product is an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a different one.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O, which is used in reactions to exchange deuterium. For example, in a keto acid, perhaps the deuterium is incorporated into the product. But I'm not sure how that would result in a product with two O's.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a diethylzinc or some other organometallic reagent. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong base like KOH. When KOH reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), it would neutralize it to form a salt (like the potassium salt) and water. The product would be a carboxylate, which has O's. But I'm not sure about the number.

Wait, but the product is supposed to have two O atoms. So, perhaps the product is something like CH3COO^- (acetate), which has two O's. But in that case, the product would have two O's in the structure. So, if X is KOH, and the keto acid is acetic acid, then the product would be potassium acetate, which has the formula CH3COOK. Each acetate ion is CH3COO^- which has two O's. So, the product would have two O's per molecule.

Ah, that seems to fit. So, in that case, X would be KOH (potassium hydroxide), Y could be acetic acid (CH3COOH), but wait, no. Because in the initial problem, X reacts with Y to form W and G. If X is KOH and Y is an acid, perhaps CH3COOH, then they would react to form water and potassium acetate. But potassium acetate is soluble, so no precipitate. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is a carbonate solution, and X is KOH. Then, the reaction would produce a carbonate salt, which might be insoluble. For example, if Y is CaCO3, but no, that's not an acid.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. If Y is a solution containing a carbonate, like CaCO3, then the reaction would be CaCO3 + 2NaOH → Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is only slightly soluble, so it might precipitate as G. Then, heating Ca(OH)2 would decompose into CaO and water. The melting point of CaO is about 2615°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is Ca(OH)2, which upon heating gives CaO, but again, melting point is way higher.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to focus on the first part again. The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So, each atom in W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons.

So, possible atoms are:

- Helium (He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons.
- Carbon-12 (C): 6 p, 6 n.
- Oxygen-16 (O): 8 p, 8 n.
- Sulfur-32 (S): 16 p, 16 n (but S is a solid at room temp).
- Chlorine-35 (Cl): 17 p, 18 n → not equal.
Wait, Chlorine-35 has 17 p and 18 n. So p != n. So no.

So, possible molecules for W could be He (monoatomic), CO (each atom: C has 6p6n, O has 8p8n. So each CO molecule has 14p and 14n → same). So W could be CO gas. But CO is a gas, but I'm not sure if this fits with the reaction.

Alternatively, W could be O2. Each O atom has 8p and 8n → so O2 would have 16p and 16n → same.

So, if W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas. That could happen if X is a peroxide, like H2O2, which decomposes to O2. But the reaction conditions would need to be acidic or catalyzed.

Alternatively, if X is a metal oxide, and Y is a strong acid, perhaps a reaction produces O2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: if X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), then reacting with water produces O2. So, 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So in this case, W would be O2. Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble. So that's not a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Maybe if Y is a solution that reacts with X to form a precipitate along with O2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, producing CO2. But then W would be CO2, which has each atom with p=n (C:6p6n, O:8p8n).

Wait, CO2 as W. Each CO2 molecule has 12 p (6+8) and 12 n (6+8). So total p = n.

So, W is CO2.

Then, the reaction is between X and Y to produce CO2, and a precipitate G.

So, X could be a carbonate, and Y an acid. For example, X is CaCO3, Y is HCl. The reaction would be CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, the precipitate G would be CaCl2, but that's soluble. So no precipitate. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps X is a different carbonate, or Y is a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3 and Y is AgNO3. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2 AgNO3 → 2 NaNO3 + Ag2CO3. Wait, but Ag2CO3 is not a stable compound. Silver carbonate decomposes to silver oxide and CO2. So perhaps the reaction would produce Ag2O and CO2, along with NaNO3. So, the precipitate G would be Ag2O. Then, heating Ag2O would produce Ag and O2. So, B would be Ag. But the melting point of silver is about 961°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: If X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce H2S gas. But H2S has 1p and 0n for each H, and S has 16p and 16n. So per H2S molecule, total p is 18 (2*1 +16), n is 16 (2*0 +16). So p != n. So that doesn't fit the W molecule condition.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that W is He gas. But how would that happen? He is a noble gas, not typically produced in such reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a strong acid, producing H2 gas. But as discussed earlier, H2 doesn't meet the p=n condition.

Wait, let's try to think of another possibility. If W is C (carbon), but as a gas? Unlikely, as carbon is solid under standard conditions. 

Wait, another angle: the problem states that substance X and especially its analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So, possible X could be a borohydride, like NaBH4 or LiAlH4. These are common reducing agents.

If X is NaBH4, then when it reacts with a keto acid, like a carboxylic acid, it would reduce the carbonyl group to a CH2OH group. So, for example, CH3COOH (acetic acid) would be reduced to CH3CH2OH (ethanol). The product ethanol has two O's? No, it has one O (the OH group). So that doesn't fit the condition of having two O's. Hmm.

Wait, unless the reaction is a partial reduction, but I don't think that would give two O's.

Another thought: perhaps the product isn't the reduced form but an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something else, like a ketone with an acidic group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something with two O's. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with two O's. No, a ketone has one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, where two O's are added. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of the elements in X.

If X is NaBH4, the elements are Na, B, H. The lightest isotopes are Na (~23), B (~11), H (~1). The heaviest isotopes would be Na-25 (but natural abundance is low), B-10, H-2 (deuterium). So, the sum would be 23 (from Na) + 11 (from B) + 2 (from H) = 36. But the options don't have 36. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is D2O. The elements are H and O. The lightest isotopes are H (1) and O (16). The heaviest isotopes would be H-2 (deuterium, 2) and O-18 (18). So, sum would be 1 (H) + 2 (H) + 16 (O) + 18 (O) = 37. Not matching the options.

Wait, but according to the question, if multiple instances of an element exist, sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. So for H in D2O: two H's, each with isotopes 1 and 2. So sum would be 1 + 2 = 3. For O: two O's, each with 16? Or just one O? Wait, D2O has two D's and one O. So, for O, the isotopes would be 16, 17, 18. But the problem says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, perhaps for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes.

So, for X = D2O: elements are H and O.

H's lightest isotope is 1, heaviest is 2 (deuterium).

O's lightest is 16, heaviest is 18.

So sum for H: 1 + 2 = 3.

Sum for O: 16 + 18 = 34.

Total cumulative: 3 + 34 = 37.

But the options don't have 37. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps X is something else, like NaOH. NaOH has Na, O, H.

Na's lightest isotope is 23, heaviest is 25.

O's lightest is 16, heaviest is 18.

H's lightest is 1, heaviest is 2.

Sum for Na: 23 +25 =48.

O: 16+18=34.

H:1+2=3.

Total sum:48+34+3=85. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is KOH. K's isotopes: 39 (most common) and 41. So sum 39+41=80. O:16+18=34. H:1+2=3. Total 80+34+3=117.

No options here.

Hmm. Maybe X is something with only two elements.

Wait, another thought: X is a carbonate. Suppose X is Na2CO3. Elements are Na and C and O.

Na: 23 and 25 → sum 48.

C: 12 and 14 → sum 26.

O: 16 and 18 → sum 34.

Total sum:48 +26 +34= 108. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the isotopes again.

Wait, perhaps X is NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide). No, but that's not a common compound.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, maybe the product has two oxygen atoms, so perhaps it's an ester. For example, if the keto acid is RCOOH and X is an alcohol, then esterification could produce an ester (RCOOR') with two O's. But X is a reagent, so perhaps it's an acid catalyst. Not sure.

Wait, but in that case, X would be something like H2SO4, which is a catalyst. But H2SO4 has H and S and O. Summing lightest and heaviest isotopes: H (1+2=3), S (32+34=66), O (16+18=34). Total sum 3+66+34=103. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the product has two O atoms in a molecule. So, the product could be something like H2O2, which has two O's. But how would that form from a keto acid and X?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with two O's. No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options provided.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, let's consider possible element pairs.

For example, if X contains H and O, with H's lightest=1, heaviest=2, and O's lightest=16, heaviest=18. So, sum for H is 3, O is 34. Total 37. Not in options.

Another option: if X contains Cl and H. Cl's lightest is 35, heaviest is 37. H:1+2=3. Sum 35+37=72 for Cl, plus 3 gives 75. Not in options.

Alternatively, if X contains C and O. C:12+14=26. O:16+18=34. Sum 26+34=60. Not in options.

Hmm. Another possibility: X contains Na and Cl. Na:23+25=48. Cl:35+37=72. Sum 48+72=120. No.

Wait, perhaps X has two elements, and each has only one isotope. For example, if X is H2O (but then isotopes are H and O). Wait, but that brings us back to the 37 sum.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a single element with isotopes. For example, chlorine has isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl. So, if X is Cl2, the lightest and heaviest would be 35 and 37. Sum 35+37=72. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a compound with elements whose lightest and heaviest sum to one of the options.

For example, if X contains O (16+18=34) and another element like N (14+15=29). Sum 34+29=63. No.

Alternatively, O (34) and C (12+14=26). Sum 34+26=60. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cumulative atomic mass is calculated as the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element present in X. So, for each element, add the lightest and heaviest isotopes, then sum all elements.

So, for example, if X has O and H:

O:16 +18=34.

H:1 +2=3.

Total sum 34+3=37.

But that's not an option.

Another example: if X has Cl and H.

Cl:35+37=72.

H:1+2=3.

Sum 75. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X has two elements, each with sum giving one of the options.

Looking at the options: 25, 29, 31, 35.

If X has two elements where each contributes to one of these sums.

For example, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (another isotope?), but no. Or 25 could be 16 (O) +9 (F?), but that's not isotopes.

Wait, another possibility: X contains only one element with multiple isotopes. For example, oxygen has isotopes 16, 17, 18. So, lightest and heaviest sum to 34. But that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X contains elements whose lightest and heaviest sum to 25. Let's see, 12 (C) +13 (another isotope, but 13 is not the heaviest for C). C's heaviest is 14. So 12+14=26. Close to option C (31) but no.

Alternatively, maybe 16 (O) +9 (F). But 9 isn't an isotope sum for F. F's isotopes are ~19 (mainly), so 19 is the main isotope. So 19+19=38, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X contains boron. Boron has two main isotopes: 11 and 10. So 10+11=21. Not matching.

Another angle: if X is something like D2O, which has H and O. Sum for H:1+2=3. O:16+18=34. Total 37. Not an option. But if the problem considers only the heaviest and lightest for each element present, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element, considering all atoms in X. For example, if X is H2O, which has two H's and one O.

H's lightest:1, heaviest:2. So sum for H: (1+2)*2 (since two H atoms) =6.

O: lightest 16, heaviest 18. Sum for O: (16+18)*1=34.

Total sum:6+34=40. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31,35.

35 is the sum of 16 (O) and 19 (F), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, 31 could be 16+15 (nitrogen). 16 is O, 15 is N. But that would imply X has O and N. So, perhaps X is something like NH3 or NO. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 12 (C) +19 (F) =31. Hmm, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, 18 (O) +13 (Al) =31. But again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cumulative sum is just the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element in X, regardless of how many atoms. For example, if X has H and O.

H: 1+2=3.

O:16+18=34.

Total 3+34=37. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X contains only one element with two isotopes, and the sum is one of the options. For example, H:1+2=3. Not in options. O:16+18=34. Not in options. Cl:35+37=72. No.

Wait, another thought: if X contains only the heaviest isotope and the lightest for each element. Maybe the calculation is different.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes, not the sum. But the wording says "cumulative atomic masses", which suggests adding them.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are considered, not isotopes. For example, if X contains O (heaviest) and H (lightest), sum 16+1=17. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X contains Cl (35.5 average) and something else. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct sum is 35. Let's see how that can happen.

35 could be 35 (Cl) and 0? No.

Alternatively, 16 (O) +19 (F) =35. But that would require X to have both O and F, which is unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: if X contains two elements, each contributing 17 and 18. Wait, 17+18=35. Maybe X has elements like N (14) and O (16). 14+16=30, but that's not 35.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to make a guess based on the options.

The options are 25,29,31,35.

I think the correct answer is 35, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is a compound containing Chlorine and something else. For example, if X is NaCl. Then:

Na's lightest is 23, heaviest 25. So sum 23+25=48.

Cl's lightest 35, heaviest 37. Sum 35+37=72.

Total sum 48+72=120. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like HCl. H:1+2=3. Cl:35+37=72. Sum 75. No.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe the correct answer is option C, 31, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 29.

Wait, considering that the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has two O's, perhaps X is something that adds an O. For example, X could be O2. But then, the product would have more O's. Not sure.

I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the given information, I'll go with option A)35.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, considering their isotopes. Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and eventually releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is a reagent in organic chemistry, often used with its analog.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates for W include CO₂ (each atom has equal protons and neutrons), O₂ (each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons), or CO (each atom has equal protons and neutrons). CO₂ is a strong candidate as it fits the criteria and is commonly produced in reactions involving carbonates and acids.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Upon heating, G releases B, which has a melting point of ~277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be a compound with a low melting point, such as water (0°C), though slight deviations could be due to impurities or specific conditions.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X may act as a reducing agent or catalyst, potentially incorporating or preserving oxygen atoms in the product.

4. **Isotopic Analysis**: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Possible candidates for X include compounds like D₂O (deuterium oxide), NaBH₄ (sodium borohydride), or other isotopic variants used in organic chemistry. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element in X must be calculated.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**:
   - For H and O in X (e.g., H₂O or D₂O):
     - H: Lightest isotope (¹H) = 1, Heaviest isotope (²H) = 2. Cumulative = 1 + 2 = 3.
     - O: Lightest isotope (¹⁶O) = 16, Heaviest isotope (¹⁸O) = 18. Cumulative = 16 + 18 = 34.
     - Total = 3 + 34 = 37. However, this does not match the options provided.
   - For Cl and H in X (e.g., HCl):
     - Cl: Lightest isotope (³⁵Cl) = 35, Heaviest isotope (³⁷Cl) = 37. Cumulative = 35 + 37 = 72.
     - H: Lightest isotope (¹H) = 1, Heaviest isotope (²H) = 2. Cumulative = 1 + 2 = 3.
     - Total = 72 + 3 = 75. This also does not match the options.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35. Based on the reasoning above, none of these directly align with the calculated sums for common candidates like H₂O, NaBH₄, or D₂O. However, 35 could correspond to the sum of isotopic masses for a specific element pair, such as chlorine (³⁵Cl) and another element.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the reasoning provided, the most plausible answer is **35**, though the exact reasoning for this sum remains unclear without additional information.
