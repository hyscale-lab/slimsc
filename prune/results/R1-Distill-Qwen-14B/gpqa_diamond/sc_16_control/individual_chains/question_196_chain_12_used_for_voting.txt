Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. 

Wait, the oscillator is obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So it's a spring-mass system, right? But it's relativistic, which probably means we have to use relativistic mechanics instead of the classical ones. Oh right, because in classical mechanics, the maximum speed would just be when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but relativity complicates things.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy (1/2 k A^2) is converted into kinetic energy (1/2 m v_max^2). Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But since it's relativistic, option C might not be the right choice.

In relativity, the energy includes the rest mass energy. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the oscillation energy. So, the total energy E should be the sum of the rest energy mc² and the potential energy at maximum amplitude, which is (1/2)k A². Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the turning points.

Wait, no, wait. In harmonic oscillators, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², so at x=A, PE is (1/2)k A². So in the relativistic scenario, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy at that point is E - mc² = (1/2)k A².

So, E = mc² + (1/2)k A². At x=0, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc² = E - mc² = (1/2)k A². So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ is equal to 1 plus (k A²)/(2 m c²). Now, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's set that: 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v_max. Let's square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity, say, let’s call it α. So α = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, the equation becomes:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

Taking reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + α)^2].

So, v_max² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + α)^2].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2. That's equal to [ (1 + α)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Expanding (1 + α)^2: 1 + 2α + α². Subtract 1, we get 2α + α². So,

v_max² = c² [ (2α + α²) / (1 + α)^2 ) ].

Factor numerator: α(2 + α). But α is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is small compared to 1 if the oscillator isn't moving at speeds close to c. Wait, but the options don't necessarily assume that. So perhaps we can keep it as it is.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in a different way.

Wait, let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + α)^2] as [ (1 + α)^2 -1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Which is (1 + 2α + α² -1)/(1 + α)^2 = (2α + α²)/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v_max² = c² (2α + α²)/(1 + α)^2.

But α = (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let me substitute back.

v_max² = c² [ (2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) is (k A²)/(m c²). So the numerator becomes:

(k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ] squared.

Wait, maybe it's better to factor the numerator and denominator.

But perhaps it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can take the reciprocal approach. Let me think.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the options again.

Option A: v_max = c√(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² )

Wait, the denominator inside the fraction is (1 - (kA²)/(2m)), which would have units of 1/[mass], which doesn't make sense because the term inside the square root should be dimensionless. So perhaps option A is incorrect because of units.

Option B: v_max = c√(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )).

Wait, the denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me compute that term.

Let me consider the denominator inside the square root in option B: 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ).

Wait, but from my earlier equation, we have 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2, where α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, so (1 + α)^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c² )

So, (1 + α)^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c² )

Which can be rearranged to:

(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + α)^2.

Wait, but no, that's what we did earlier. So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

Wait, but looking at option B's expression inside the square root:

1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)).

Hmm, that's 1 + 1/(1 - α'), where α' = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, that's 1 + 1/(1 - α') = [ (1 - α') + 1 ] / (1 - α') ) = (2 - α')/(1 - α').

But in my case, from earlier, v²/c² = [ (2α + α^2) ] / (1 + α)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare all options against the expression I derived.

Wait, the expression I found is v_max² = c² [ (2 α + α²)/(1 + α)^2 ].

So,

v_max = c sqrt( (2α + α²)/(1 + α)^2 ) ) 

= c * sqrt( (α (2 + α) )/( (1 + α)^2 ) ) )

= c * sqrt( α (2 + α) ) / (1 + α )

Hmm, not sure if that's matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy.

At maximum displacement x = A, all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)k A² + mc².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so E = gamma mc².

So, gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same as before. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + α, where α = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So, rearranging for v:

v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2} )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ] ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if any of the options match that.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )).

Wait, let's compute that expression inside the square root.

1 + 1/(1 - alpha') where alpha' = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So, 1 + 1/(1 - alpha') = (1 - alpha' + 1 )/(1 - alpha') = (2 - alpha')/(1 - alpha').

Wait, but my expression was sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha ), multiplied by c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each option.

Wait, let me compute each option.

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

Hmm, but the denominator inside the fraction is (1 - (kA²)/(2m)), but that has units of 1/[mass] * [length]^2? Wait, because k has units of N/m = kg/s². So (k A²) has units kg/s² * m² = kg m^0 s^{-2} * m² = kg m^{-2} s^{-2}? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Alternatively, perhaps the terms inside the square roots should be dimensionless. So, looking at option A, (1 - (kA²)/(2m)) has units kg/(kg) ) because kA² has units kg m²/s², and 2m is kg. So kg m²/s² divided by kg is m²/s². Wait, no, that would be (kg/s² * m²) / kg = m²/s². Wait, but m is in kg. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let me think about units. The term inside the sqrt must be dimensionless.

Option A: [1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )² ]

The denominator in the fraction is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)). Let's compute the units of (k A^2)/(2m).

k has units N/m = kg/s².

A² is m².

m is kg.

So, (kg/s² * m²) / kg = (kg m²)/(s² kg) ) = m²/s². But 1 is dimensionless, so this can't be right. So the term (1 - (k A²)/(2m)) would have units m²/s², which is not dimensionless. So option A would have a unit of m²/s² inside the sqrt, which is invalid. So option A must be incorrect.

Similarly, option B has 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ), let's check the units.

(k A^2)/(2 m c²). k is kg/s², A² is m², m is kg, c² is m²/s².

So,

(kg/s² * m^2) / ( kg * m²/s² ) ) = ( kg m²/s² )/( kg m²/s² ) ) = 1. So dimensionless. So yes, the denominator is dimensionless, so option B's term inside the square root is dimensionless.

So option B's expression is plausible.

Let me compute what option B gives. It says v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²) )) )

Let me compute the term inside:

1 + 1/(1 - α), where α = (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1 + 1/(1 - α) = [ (1 - α) + 1 ]/(1 - α) ) = (2 - alpha)/(1 - alpha).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 - alpha)/(1 - alpha) ).

But from earlier, my expression was v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) )/(1 + alpha)^2 ).

Wait, not sure. Let me compare:

In my expression, v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ]/(1 + alpha)^2.

Option B's expression inside the sqrt is (2 - alpha)/(1 - alpha).

Hmm, perhaps they are not the same. So let's see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy (1/2 k A²). So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the energy is all kinetic, which is gamma mc².

So, gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + alpha, with alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + alpha.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which becomes,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

= c sqrt( ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 )/(1 + alpha)^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ) ) / (1 + alpha)

= c sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, I don't see any of the options matching this exactly.

Wait, but maybe I can manipulate this expression further. Let me factor the numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha (2 + alpha) = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

But perhaps I can factor this as alpha (2 + alpha) = (2 + alpha) alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be written as:

sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) = sqrt( alpha ) * sqrt(2 + alpha )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )² )

So, inside the square root it's 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2, which is exactly the same as what I have for v²/c².

Wait, wait a second. Because v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

But option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is exactly this expression. So option D looks correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option B was a possibility. I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me check option D again. Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Which is exactly the same as the expression I derived. So option D must be the correct one.

Wait, but earlier I thought I saw that option D was correct, but I was confused about the other options.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Considerations**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude:
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   At equilibrium, the kinetic energy equals the total energy:
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]
   Solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
