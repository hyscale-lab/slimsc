Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking what the radius of such a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star. 

Hmm. So the key here is to compare the dip in brightness caused by the planet blocking the star's light to the dip caused by the spots on the star. Since the star's brightness varies due to the spots, the amplitude of that variation is what we're looking at. The question states that if the star wasn't spotty, what planet radius would mimic that amplitude.

Wait, but the star is spotty on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view from our perspective. Because the spots are cooler, the star's total brightness depends on how much of the spotted area is visible. The problem might be modeling the situation where the spots cause a dip in brightness similar to a planet transit.

So, let's think. The dip in brightness (the variation) depends on the area of the spot that's blocking light. But wait, in this case, the spots are on the star's surface and cause a decrease in brightness when they're in view. So the amplitude of the dip would be proportional to the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's total surface.

Wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits the star, the planet blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness is the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's disk. For the star with spots, when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they contribute less brightness. So the dip would be the area of the spots that's currently on the side we can see, which is half the star's surface, right? Or wait, no, the hemisphere is the entire one, but maybe the spots are spread over a hemisphere. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of that hemisphere is spots.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. But since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total spot area would be 0.2 * (π R²) * (1/2) ? Because the area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R²? Or wait, actually, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R², but wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so the area of the entire surface is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20%, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But wait, when only one hemisphere is spotty, does that mean that the spots only cover that part, and the other hemisphere is spot-free? 

So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and go out of view. Since the star is rotating, the spots on the hemisphere will be visible for half the rotation period. So the maximum area of spots visible to us at any time is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.4 π R², but since the hemisphere is half the star, perhaps the maximum spot area visible is 0.2 * (2π R²) / 2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The star's total surface is 4π R². One hemisphere is entirely covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. The hemisphere's area is 2π R² (since the star is a sphere). So the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots could be facing us, so the spots would block that area. Alternatively, if the star is rotating such that the spots are on the far side, then the spots are not visible. So the maximum spot area visible is 0.4 π R². The minimum would be when none of the hemisphere is visible, so the spot area is 0. But the average effect comes into play for the brightness variation.

Wait, but the problem is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. The maximum dip would be when the maximum area of the spots is facing us. So the dip would be proportional to the spot area as a fraction of the star's total area.

Wait, but the star's brightness is affected by the spots' temperature. So the spots are cooler, so they emit less light. So the total brightness when the spots are in view is lower because those spots aren't contributing as much to the light. So the change in brightness (delta flux) is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness as the sum of the bright regions and the spots. But maybe a better approach is to calculate the effective change in flux when the spots are visible.

The star's total flux when spots are present is less than when they're not. Let's think in terms of the star's luminosity.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

Each spot has a temperature of (6000 - 1000) = 5000 K, I think. Wait, no, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So if the star is 6000 K, the spots are 5000 K.

So the spots emit less flux. So the total flux without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When spots are present on a hemisphere, the flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spots.

The area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R². The remaining area on that hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R²? Wait, no. The hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% is spots, so 0.2 * 2π R² is 0.4 π R² for spots. The rest (80%) is normal, which is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

But wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, only the hemisphere facing us contributes to the light we receive. So if the star is rotating, the spots on the hemisphere that's facing us will reduce the observed flux.

Wait, but the star's rotation causes the spots to come into and out of view. So when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the star's total flux is lower. At other times, the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is higher.

Wait, no. Actually, the star is rotating, so the spots on the front hemisphere will affect the light. But perhaps the question is considering the maximum variation, which is when the spots are on the side facing us.

Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is that as the star rotates, the spot area visible varies between 0 and 0.4 π R². So the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is visible. But perhaps the maximum dip is (area of spots) / (area of star) times the relative change in flux per unit area.

Wait, but the flux per unit area (surface brightness) is different for the spots and the rest of the star. So each part of the star's surface emits flux based on its temperature.

So the total flux when the spots are visible would be the sum of the fluxes from the unspotted parts and the spotted parts.

The star's total flux without any spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When a spot is present, the flux from that spot is σ (5000)^4 per unit area, and the rest is σ (6000)^4.

But wait, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star is rotating, the spots will be on the front or back hemisphere as seen from Earth. So when a spot is on the front (facing Earth), the spot contributes less flux than the surrounding areas, which affects the total. But when the spot is on the far side, it doesn't contribute to our observed flux.

Wait, but in reality, the spots on the far side are not affecting our observations because we can't see them. So the total flux we observe depends on how much of the star's surface is spotted and visible.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the relative change in flux when the spots are on the visible side.

Let me think: when the spots are fully visible, the total flux is L = (unspotted area) * σ Teff^4 + (spotted area) * σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

Wait, no, because the star's surface isn't entirely covered by spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots.

Wait, but the star's rotation makes the spots come into view. So when the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is L0. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is reduced.

Wait, perhaps I should model the scenario where the star is rotating, and we observe half of its surface at a time. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is (unspotted part of the visible hemisphere) * σ T^4 + (spotted part of the visible hemisphere) * σ (T-1000)^4.

Wait, no. The star's total surface is 4π R². One hemisphere is spotty, the other is not. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2π R², with 20% spots and 80% normal. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing, the visible area is 2π R², all normal.

So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing is:

Flux_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

And the flux when the other hemisphere is facing is:

Flux_clean = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) is Flux_clean - Flux_spotty.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is less. So the dip is (Flux_clean - Flux_spotty) / Flux_clean.

Wait, actually, no. The variation is the difference between the two. So the maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is visible. The dip is (Flux_clean - Flux_spotty) / Flux_clean.

Wait, but let me think again: When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, so the brightness is lower, so the dip is (Flux_spotty - Flux_clean) would be negative, but the amplitude is the absolute value. So the dip is (Flux_clean - Flux_spotty) / Flux_clean.

So let's compute this.

Compute Flux_spotty:

= 0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

= 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)].

Similarly, Flux_clean = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

So the dip in flux is:

Dip = (Flux_clean - Flux_spotty) / Flux_clean.

Substituting:

Dip = [2π R² σ (6000^4) - 2π R² σ (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4)] / [2π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (6000^4) - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4) ) ] / 6000^4

= [ 1 - 0.8 - (0.2 * (5000^4 / 6000^4) ) ] 

Wait, let me compute each term.

First, simplify:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15 (units don't matter, since we're dealing with ratios).

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So, compute each term:

0.8 * 6000^4 = 0.8 * 1.296e15 = 1.0368e15.

0.2 * 5000^4 = 0.2 * 6.25e14 = 1.25e14.

Adding those two: 1.0368e15 + 1.25e14 = 1.1618e15.

Flux_clean term is 1.296e15.

So,

Dip = (1.296e15 - 1.1618e15) / 1.296e15

= (1.342e14) / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.1036, which is about 10.36% dip.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute the exact value.

Let me compute the ratio inside the brackets.

Compute 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4) = 0.8*(6^4) + 0.2*(5^4) multiplied by (1e3)^4.

But since we're taking the ratio, the (1e3)^4 cancels out.

So, compute 0.8*(6^4) + 0.2*(5^4).

6^4=1296, 5^4=625.

So:

0.8 * 1296 = 1036.8

0.2 * 625 = 125

Adding them: 1036.8 + 125 = 1161.8.

The Flux_clean is 6^4 = 1296.

So,

Dip = [1296 - 1161.8] / 1296

= (134.2) / 1296 ≈ 0.1036, so about 10.36% dip.

Now, that's the dip caused by the spots on the star. The problem states that this dip is similar to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star. So, when a planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2 times the star's flux, assuming the planet is small compared to the star and fully blocks that area.

Wait, no. The dip in brightness when a planet transits is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_p^2 / R_s^2), because the planet blocks that part of the star's light.

But wait, the planet's area is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_s^2, so the fraction is (R_p^2 / R_s^2).

So, the dip amplitude (delta F/F) is (R_p / R_s)^2.

So, if the dip amplitude due to the spots is approximately 10.36%, then the planet's dip would be (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.1036.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, no. Because the dip caused by the planet is a simple ratio of areas. But the dip caused by the spots is a more complicated situation because the spots are cooler, not completely blocking the light.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The dip from the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2. The dip from the spots is 10.36% as calculated. So to find R_p / R_s such that (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.1036.

So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32, which would be about 0.322. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, the dip from the planet is when the planet's disk entirely blocks part of the star. So the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2. For the star with spots, the dip is about 10.36%, so the planet dip needs to match that. So (R_p / R_s)^2 ≈ 0.1036 → R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322, which is about 0.32. So option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because when the spots are on the star, the dip is due to the spots appearing cooler, so the star's overall brightness is reduced when the spots are visible. But a planet blocks some of the star's light, so the dip is the area of the planet over the star's area. So the dip in brightness from the planet is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) = (R_p/R_s)^2.

So according to this, the correct answer would be D, ~0.32.

Looking back to the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2 = 0.1521 → 15% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49%

C) 0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21%

D) 0.32 → ~0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Which matches our calculated 10.36% dip, so option D is correct.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature of 5000 K. The brightness variation arises due to the reduced flux from the cooler spots when they are visible. The goal is to find the exoplanet radius \( R_p \) relative to the star's radius \( R_s \) such that the dip in brightness caused by the planet matches the dip caused by the spots.

### Step 1: Calculate the brightness dip caused by the spots
The total flux from the star without spots is:

\[
L_0 = 4\pi R_s^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

\[
L_{\text{spotty}} = (0.8 \cdot 2\pi R_s^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4) + (0.2 \cdot 2\pi R_s^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 5000^4)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
L_{\text{spotty}} = 2\pi R_s^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.2 \cdot 5000^4 \right]
\]

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is:

\[
L_{\text{clean}} = 2\pi R_s^2 \sigma \cdot 6000^4
\]

The dip in brightness is:

\[
\text{Dip} = \frac{L_{\text{clean}} - L_{\text{spotty}}}{L_{\text{clean}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Dip} = \frac{1296 - (1036.8 + 125)}{1296} = \frac{134.2}{1296} \approx 0.1036 \, \text{(or 10.36%)}.
\]

### Step 2: Relate the dip to the exoplanet's radius
The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star:

\[
\text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_s} \right)^2
\]

To match the dip caused by the spots (10.36%), we solve for \( R_p / R_s \):

\[
\left( \frac{R_p}{R_s} \right)^2 = 0.1036 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_p}{R_s} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
From the given options:

- **A) ~0.39**: \( 0.39^2 = 0.1521 \) (15.21% dip, too large).
- **B) ~0.07**: \( 0.07^2 = 0.0049 \) (0.49% dip, too small).
- **C) ~0.11**: \( 0.11^2 = 0.0121 \) (1.21% dip, too small).
- **D) ~0.32**: \( 0.32^2 = 0.1024 \) (10.24% dip, closest to 10.36%).

Thus, the correct answer is **D) ~0.32**.

Answer: D
