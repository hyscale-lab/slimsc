Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about matrices and their properties, specifically related to quantum mechanics.

The matrices given are W, X, Y, and Z. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct statement based on these matrices.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about quantum mechanics and matrix properties. 

In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Hermitian matrices have the property that they are equal to their conjugate transpose. So, for a matrix H to be Hermitian, H = H†, where H† is the conjugate transpose. Also, the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are real, which is important because observables must have real eigenvalues.

The evolution operator, often denoted as U, is a unitary matrix. Unitary matrices satisfy UU† = U†U = I, where I is the identity matrix. Additionally, the evolution operator is usually represented by e^(-iHt/ħ), where H is the Hamiltonian (which is Hermitian). So, if a matrix is unitary, it could be an evolution operator. But wait, the evolution operator must also be unitary. 

Another point is that the exponential of a matrix e^M is computed using its Taylor series expansion. For a matrix M, e^M = I + M + M²/2! + M³/3! + ... etc.

Now, let's look at each option and the matrices to see which statements are correct.

Option A: "There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes."

Hmm. So, the question is about whether the operator e^X preserves the norm of some vector. If e^X is unitary, then any vector's norm would be preserved because unitary operators preserve inner products, hence norms. But if e^X isn't unitary, then there must be some vector where the norm changes. So, I need to check if e^X is unitary. But wait, X is given. To find if e^X is unitary, we can check if X is skew-Hermitian because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. A skew-Hermitian matrix S satisfies S† = -S.

Let me compute X's conjugate transpose (X†) and see if it's equal to -X.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, the conjugate of X (X*) would change the signs of the imaginary parts. Then, X† is the transpose of X*, which swaps rows and columns.

Compute X's conjugate first:

X* would be:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then, transpose this to get X†. So, the columns become rows.

X† would be:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, let's compute -X.

-X is each element of X multiplied by -1.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, -X:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Comparing X† and -X:

X†:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Which matches -X exactly. So, X† = -X => X is skew-Hermitian. Therefore, e^X is unitary because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. 

If e^X is unitary, then for any vector v, ||e^X v|| = ||v||. So, the norm doesn't change for any vector. Therefore, option A says there exists a vector where the norm changes, which would be false. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and trace 1. Alternatively, a pure state is a unit vector in a Hilbert space, but in matrix form, a density matrix is a projector (like |ψ><ψ|).

But wait, (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation of Y by e^X. Since e^X is unitary (as we saw), the product e^X Y e^{-X} is a unitary conjugation, which preserves the Hermiticity and spectrum of Y. 

Looking at Y: Y is a 3x3 matrix with elements 0.5, 0.1, etc. Let me check if Y is Hermitian. Y's elements are all real, so Y† is Y^T. Y is symmetric (since Y_ij = Y_ji), so Y is Hermitian. So Y is a Hermitian matrix.

So, when we do e^X Y e^{-X}, the result is another Hermitian matrix because unitary transformations preserve Hermiticity. However, for it to represent a quantum state, it must be a density matrix. So, does this transformed matrix have trace 1 and positive semi-definite?

Wait, Y has a trace of 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So Y has trace 1. Since e^X is unitary, the transformed matrix will have the same trace as Y, because trace is invariant under similarity transformations. So the trace remains 1.

But is the transformed matrix positive semi-definite? Y is a positive semi-definite matrix because all its eigenvalues are non-negative. Since we're conjugating Y by a unitary matrix, the eigenvalues remain the same, so the transformed matrix is also positive semi-definite. Therefore, e^X Y e^{-X} is a positive semi-definite, Hermitian matrix with trace 1. So it's a valid density matrix, representing a quantum state. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Y isn't necessarily a density matrix yet. Let me think again. Y is a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements summing to 1, but to be a density matrix, all the eigenvalues must be non-negative and the trace must be 1.

Looking at Y: The diagonal is [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]. Off-diagonal are 0.1, 0.2, etc. Let me see if Y is positive semi-definite. One way is to check if all its eigenvalues are non-negative.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that since Y is a symmetric matrix (since all elements are real and Y_ij = Y_ji), we can compute its eigenvalues. But without doing actual calculation, perhaps it's safer to proceed.

But wait, the question is whether the transformed Y is a quantum state. Since Y is Hermitian, and after the transformation it remains Hermitian, and since the trace is 1, and if all eigenvalues are non-negative, it would be a state. So the transformed matrix would have the same eigenvalues as Y, because similarity transformations don't change eigenvalues. So if Y is positive semi-definite, the transformed matrix is also positive semi-definite.

So, if Y is a valid density matrix, then e^X Y e^{-X} is also a valid density matrix. But wait, the problem states that Y is a 3x3 matrix given as Y. To check if Y is a valid density matrix, I need to ensure that all its eigenvalues are non-negative and the trace is 1.

The trace of Y is 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1, so that's good. Now, are the eigenvalues non-negative?

Looking at Y:

Row 1: [0.5, 0.1, 0.2]

Row 2: [0.1, 0.25, 0.1]

Row 3: [0.2, 0.1, 0.25]

This looks similar to a covariance matrix or a matrix with small off-diagonal elements. To check if it's positive semi-definite, perhaps we can compute its determinant or check the principal minors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the leading principal minors and check if they're all positive.

The first leading minor is 0.5, which is positive.

Second leading minor is the determinant of the top-left 2x2 matrix:

|0.5 0.1|
|0.1 0.25|

Determinant = (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115 >0.

Third leading minor is the determinant of the entire matrix. Let me compute that.

Compute det(Y):

Using the rule for 3x3 determinants.

0.5*(0.25*0.25 - (0.1)^2) - 0.1*(0.1*0.25 - 0.1*0.2) + 0.2*(0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2)

Wait, let me write it out:

= 0.5 * ( (0.25)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.1) ) 
- 0.1 * ( (0.1)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.2) ) 
+ 0.2 * ( (0.1)(0.1) - (0.25)(0.2) )

Calculating each term:

First term: 0.5 * (0.0625 - 0.01) = 0.5 * 0.0525 = 0.02625

Second term: 0.1 * (0.025 - 0.02) = 0.1 * 0.005 = 0.0005. But it's subtracted, so -0.0005.

Third term: 0.2 * (0.01 - 0.05) = 0.2 * (-0.04) = -0.008. But it's positive because the third term is multiplied by 0.2 and has a positive sign in the formula, but (0.1)(0.1) is 0.01, (0.25)(0.2) is 0.05, so 0.01-0.05 = -0.04. So third term is 0.2*(-0.04) = -0.008.

So total determinant: 0.02625 - 0.0005 -0.008 = 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

Which is positive. So all leading principal minors are positive, implying that Y is positive definite. So Y is a valid density matrix, and when transformed by e^X (which is unitary), the result is another density matrix. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait, option B says (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state. Since Y is a state, and the transformation is unitary, the result is also a state. So option B is correct.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

An observable must be Hermitian. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

Let's look at X first. X is given as:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

We can compute X† and see if it equals X.

X* is the conjugate of each element. So X* would be:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i

Row 2:1, 0, 1

Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then X† is the transpose of X*, which swaps rows and columns.

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare this to X:

X's rows are:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Which is not the same as X. So X is not Hermitian, which means it can't be an observable. Therefore, option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

Wait, but wait, what about Z? Let's check Z.

Z is given as:

Row 1: 3, 2i, 5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row 3: 5, 4i, 4

Compute Z's conjugate transpose (Z†).

First, take the conjugate of each element:

Row 1: 3, -2i, 5

Row 2: 2i, -2, 4i

Row 3:5, -4i,4

Then transpose to get Z†.

Z† would be:

Row 1:3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2,4i

Row 3:5, -4i,4

Which is the same as Z. Because the original Z has:

Row1:3,2i,5

Row2:-2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5,4i,4

Wait, no. Looking at Z:

Original Z:

Row 1: 3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row3:5,4i,4

So Z's conjugate is:

Row1:3, -2i,5

Row2:2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Then transpose to get Z†:

Row1:3, 2i,5

Row2:-2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Compare with original Z:

Z's row1 is [3,2i,5]

Z's row2 is [-2i, -2, -4i]

Z's row3 is [5,4i,4]

So, Z† is:

Row1:3, 2i,5

Row2: -2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Which is not equal to Z. Because, for example, in Z, row 3 column 2 is 4i, but in Z†, row3 column2 is -4i. So Z† is not equal to Z. So Z is not Hermitian. Therefore, option C is incorrect because neither X nor Z is Hermitian.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator U must be unitary. So, I need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, let's check W.

W is:

Row1:0,0,1

Row2:0,1,0

Row3:1,0,0

Compute W† (since W is real, W† is the transpose).

W's transpose is:

Row1:0,0,1

Row2:0,1,0

Row3:1,0,0

Which is the same as W. So W is symmetric. Now, to check if W is unitary, compute W† * W and see if it equals I.

W† is W itself. So W† * W = W^2.

Compute W^2 = W * W.

W matrix:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

Multiply W by W:

Element (1,1) is (0*0 +0*0 +1*1) =1

Element (1,2): (0*0 +0*1 +1*0) =0

Element (1,3): (0*1 +0*0 +1*0)=0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps W is a permutation matrix. Let's compute W squared.

W^2 = W * W:

First row of W: [0,0,1]

Multiplying by each column of W:

First column: 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 =1

Second column:0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0

Third column:0*1 +0*0 +1*0 =0

So first row of W^2 is [1,0,0].

Second row of W: [0,1,0]

Multiplying by columns:

First column:0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0

Second column:0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1

Third column:0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0

So second row is [0,1,0].

Third row of W: [1,0,0]

Multiplying by columns:

First column:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0

Second column:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0

Third column:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1

So third row is [0,0,1].

So W^2 is:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1

Which is the identity matrix. Therefore, W^2 = I. So W is unitary because W† W = I. So W is a unitary matrix.

Now, check X. Earlier, we found that X is skew-Hermitian, which implies that e^X is unitary. But X itself isn't necessarily unitary. Wait, wait: Wait, the question is whether X is the evolution operator. But the evolution operator is typically unitary, not necessarily the generator (which would be skew-Hermitian). 

Wait, the evolution operator U is usually given by e^(-i H t /ħ), where H is Hermitian. So, the generator H is Hermitian, and thus -i H t is skew-Hermitian. So e^{-i H t} is unitary.

But the question is whether X is the evolution operator. X being the evolution operator would require X to be unitary. So is X unitary?

A matrix U is unitary if U† U = I.

We have X's conjugate transpose (X†) equal to -X, as we found earlier.

So, X† X = (-X) X = -X².

If X is unitary, then X† X = I. So, -X² = I. Then, X² = -I.

Let me compute X squared to see if this holds.

Compute X².

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2:1,0,1

Row3:2i, -1, -i

Compute X² = X * X.

Let's compute each element.

Element (1,1): (i * i) + (-1 * 1) + (2i * 2i) 

= i² + (-1) + (4i²) 

= (-1) + (-1) + (4*(-1)) 

= -1 -1 -4 = -6.

Element (1,2): i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + 2i*(-1)

= -i + 0 -2i = -3i.

Element (1,3): i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + 2i*(-i)

= (2i²) + (-1) + (-2i²)

= (2*(-1)) + (-1) + (-2*(-1)) 

= (-2) -1 +2 = -1.

Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that if X is skew-Hermitian, then X† = -X. So X is skew-Hermitian. 

The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So e^X is unitary, as we saw earlier. But X itself is not unitary; it's skew-Hermitian. Is a skew-Hermitian matrix unitary?

Wait, for a matrix to be unitary, its conjugate transpose must be its inverse. So, U† = U^{-1}.

If S is skew-Hermitian, then S† = -S. So S inverse is (-S†)^{-1} ?

Wait, let me compute S inverse. For any invertible matrix S, S^{-1} = (1/det(S)) adj(S). But perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, since S is skew-Hermitian, S† = -S. So S^{-1} = (S†)^{-1} = (-S)^{-1} = - S^{-1}.

Wait, that's not possible unless S is zero matrix, which it isn't. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, let me compute X† X and see if it equals I.

X† is -X, so X† X = (-X) X = -X².

If X is unitary, then X† X = I. So -X² = I, which implies X² = -I.

But let's compute X squared.

Compute X * X:

Row 1 of X: [i, -1, 2i]

Multiply by each column of X.

First column of X: [i, 1, 2i]

Compute (Row 1 * Col 1):

i*i + (-1)*1 + 2i * 2i 

= i² + (-1) + 4i² 

= (-1) + (-1) + 4*(-1) 

= -1 -1 -4 = -6.

Second column of X: [-1, 0, -1]

Row1 * Col2:

i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + 2i*(-1) 

= -i + 0 -2i = -3i.

Third column of X: [2i, 1, -i]

Row1 * Col3:

i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + 2i*(-i)

= 2i² + (-1) + (-2i²)

= 2*(-1) -1 + 2*1 

= -2 -1 +2 = -1.

So first row of X squared is [-6, -3i, -1].

Now, second row of X is [1, 0, 1].

Multiply by columns of X.

First column:1*i + 0*1 +1*(2i) = i + 0 + 2i = 3i.

Second column:1*(-1) + 0*0 +1*(-1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2.

Third column:1*(2i) + 0*1 +1*(-i) = 2i +0 -i = i.

So second row of X squared is [3i, -2, i].

Third row of X is [2i, -1, -i].

Multiply by each column.

First column:2i * i + (-1)*1 + (-i)*2i.

= 2i² + (-1) + (-2i²)

= 2*(-1) -1 +2*1 

= -2 -1 +2 = -1.

Second column:2i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + (-i)*(-1)

= -2i +0 +i = (-2i +i) = -i.

Third column:2i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + (-i)*(-i)

=4i² + (-1) + (i²)

=4*(-1) -1 + (-1)

= -4 -1 -1 = -6.

So third row of X squared is [-1, -i, -6].

Putting it all together, X squared is:

[-6   -3i    -1

 3i    -2     i

 -1    -i    -6]

Which is definitely not equal to -I. Because I is identity matrix, and -I would have -1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. So X squared is not equal to -I. Hence, X is not unitary.

So, the evolution operator requires U to be unitary, but X is not unitary. So option D is incorrect because X is not unitary, so it can't be the evolution operator. W is unitary, but X is not, so both W and X can't be evolution operators. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

So, summarizing:

Option A: Incorrect, because e^X is unitary, so norm doesn't change for any vector. So no such vector exists.

Option B: Correct. (e^X)* Y * (e^{-X}) is a density matrix, so it represents a quantum state.

Option C: Incorrect, because X and Z are not Hermitian.

Option D: Incorrect, because X is not unitary, so W and X cannot both be evolution operators.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct statement about the given matrices in the context of quantum mechanics, we analyze each option systematically:

### Option A
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which multiplying by \( e^X \) changes the norm. For this to be true, \( e^X \) must not preserve the norm, which would happen if \( e^X \) is not unitary. However, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian because \( X^\dagger = -X \). The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary, meaning \( e^X \) preserves the norm of any vector. Thus, no such vector exists, and this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option B
The statement claims that \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) represents a quantum state. A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. 

1. **Hermiticity**: \( Y \) is Hermitian because it is symmetric (real elements and \( Y^\dagger = Y \)). Since \( e^X \) is unitary, the similarity transformation \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) preserves Hermiticity.
2. **Trace**: The trace of \( Y \) is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \). Since trace is invariant under similarity transformations, \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) also has trace 1.
3. **Positive Semi-Definiteness**: \( Y \) is positive semi-definite because all its eigenvalues are non-negative. Similarity transformations by unitary matrices preserve eigenvalues, so \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) is also positive semi-definite.

Thus, \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) is a valid density matrix and represents a quantum state. This statement is **correct**.

---

### Option C
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. 

1. **\( X \)**: \( X^\dagger \neq X \), as shown by direct computation. Therefore, \( X \) is not Hermitian.
2. **\( Z \)**: \( Z^\dagger \neq Z \), as shown by direct computation. Therefore, \( Z \) is not Hermitian.

Since neither \( X \) nor \( Z \) is Hermitian, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option D
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of some quantum system. The evolution operator \( U \) must be unitary, i.e., \( U^\dagger U = I \).

1. **\( W \)**: \( W^\dagger = W \) (real and symmetric), and \( W^2 = I \), so \( W \) is unitary.
2. **\( X \)**: While \( e^X \) is unitary (since \( X \) is skew-Hermitian), \( X \) itself is not unitary. As shown earlier, \( X^\dagger X \neq I \).

Since \( X \) is not unitary, \( W \) and \( X \) cannot both represent the evolution operator. This statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Conclusion
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) is a valid density matrix representing a quantum state.

**Answer: B**
