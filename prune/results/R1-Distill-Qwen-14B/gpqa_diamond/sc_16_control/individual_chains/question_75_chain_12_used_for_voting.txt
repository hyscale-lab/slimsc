Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about gene expression and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're overexpressing the coding sequence of GADD45G. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. Then they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. They're using antibiotic resistance to select the colonies, but when they test expression, the protein isn't overexpressed as expected.

The question is why. The options are A to D.

Looking at the sequence given. The plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's TAC, which is tyrosine. But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the HA tag would be the first part of the construct, right?

Wait, the HA tag is part of the coding sequence. Let me think: the HA tag is a short peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. Its DNA sequence would be right after the start codon. So if the construct is designed correctly, the HA would be first, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

But wait, looking at the provided plus strand sequence. It starts with ATG, then TAC. TAC is the codon for tyrosine. If the HA tag is supposed to be the first part, the construct should have the HA sequence right after the ATG.

Wait, the HA tag is added by inserting its coding sequence into the construct. So the DNA should be ATG followed by the HA coding, then the GADD45G coding. But in the provided sequence, after ATG, it's TAC. Let's see what that translates to.

ATG is methionine, start. Then TAC is tyrosine. So the initial part is Met Tyr. But the HA tag's first codon is probably different. Let me remember the HA tag amino acid sequence. I think it's YPYDVPDYA or something like that. Wait, maybe it's shorter. Alternatively, HA is a specific epitope, maybe from the influenza HA protein. The HA tag is usually around 11 amino acids. So the DNA would be, for example, ATG followed by the codons for those 11 amino acids.

But in the given sequence, after ATG, it's TAC. So the first amino acid after methionine is tyrosine. That would be part of the HA tag? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. The HA tag's first codon would be ATG, then the next codon would be whatever the first amino acid is. Wait, no, the ATG is the start codon, then the next codon is part of the HA.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is inserted in the wrong reading frame? Because if the reading frame is off, the entire coding sequence would be messed up.

Alternatively, maybe the start codon is not in the right place. Let me see: the given sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first three codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro). So the sequence starts with Met Tyr Pro... That's the beginning of the HA tag?

Wait, the HA tag is usually a specific sequence. For example, the HA tag is: YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate that into nucleotides. Each amino acid is three nucleotides.

Y is TAC, P is CCA or CCG (depends on the P), Y is TAC, D is GAT or GAA, V is GTA, P is CCA, Y is TAC, A is GCT or GCA.

Wait, let's think about the HA epitope. The standard HA tag is derived from the HA0 protein of the influenza virus, I think. The HA tag is typically: YPYDVPDYA. Let me write that out as codons.

YP is Tyr Pro: TAC CCA.

Then YD is Tyr Asp: TAC GAT.

VP: Val Pro: GTA CCA.

DY: Asp Tyr: GAT TAC.

PA: Pro Ala: CCA GCT.

Wait, but that's a lot of codons. Let me count: 11 amino acids would be 11 codons, so 33 nucleotides. So the HA coding sequence is 33 nucleotides after the start.

But in the given sequence, after ATG, the next 33 nucleotides would be TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, let me check:

The sequence starts with:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's 12 nucleotides (4 codons) into the sequence.

Wait, let's see: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first four codons are:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTC (Val)
Wait, no, the sequence after ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT is:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is correctly placed, but the problem is elsewhere.

The person is trying to overexpress the protein but can't. So let's think about the possible issues.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acid, perhaps disrupting the HA epitope but not necessarily preventing the protein from being expressed. Unless it's a premature stop codon.

Looking at the sequence: the start is ATG, then TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTC (Val), etc. Wait, after GAT is GTC? Or wait, let's index it:

Positions 1-3: ATG (Met)
4-6: TAC (Tyr)
7-9: CCA (Pro)
10-12: TAC (Tyr)
13-15: GAT (Asp)
16-18: G T C (Val: GTC)
19-21: CAG (Gln)
22-24: ATT (Ile)
25-27: ACC (Thr)
28-30: GAA (Glu)
31-33: TAC (Tyr)
34-36: G C C (Ala)
37-39: AAT (Asn)
40-42: GCT (Ala)
43-45: TGG (Trp)
46-48: TCC (Ser)
49-51: GAA (Glu)
52-54: AGT (Ser)
55-57: TGA (Trp)
Wait, TGA is a stop codon.

Wait, wait, hold on. Let me count that again. After ATG, the sequence is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA TAC GCC AAT GCT TGG TCC GAA GAT TCT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, okay, perhaps I should look for any stop codons within the sequence. Because if there's a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) early, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let's scan.

Looking at positions:

- After ATG, ... GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA TAC GCC AAT GCT TGG TCC GAA GAT TCT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, looking for TGA. Let me look in the first part:

... TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA TAC GCC AAT GCT TGG TCC GAA GAT TCT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ...

I see TGG which is Trp, but not a stop. Then GCT TGG: that's GCT (Ala) TGG (Trp). Then TCC (Ser) GAA (Glu). No stop codon there.

Wait, later on, I see AGT (Ser), then TGA (Trp?), which is a stop codon. Let me see:

... CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Looking for TGA: AGA is arginine.

Wait, what is this? Let me read the sequence again.

Wait, here's part of the sequence: ... TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Hmm, somewhere in this, is there a TGA? Let me look.

I see: TGG TCC GAA. So TGG is Trp, TCC is Ser, GAA is Glu. No.

Then, looking further: ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, is there a TAG or TAA? I don't see it yet. Let me check the end:

... GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA (Trp stop?), but wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the last three are GAG TGA. So wait, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA.

Wait, no, the entire sequence is:

...CTC CGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So the last part is ... CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the last part:

The sequence ends as:

...GAGTGA3'

So the last few nucleotides are 'GAGTGA'. That's 6 nucleotides. Breaking into codons:

GAG (Glu) and TGA (stop). So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So that's after the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but that would mean that the sequence is correctly ending with a stop codon. So no premature stop codon. So the protein should be expressed.

But in the given plus strand, the sequence is correct, so why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, but the problem is that the person couldn't overexpress the protein. So what could be wrong?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The HA determinant has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but not necessarily prevent expression. Unless the HA tag is messed up, but the question is about overexpression.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen with a stop codon in the mRNA before the end. But in the sequence, the only stop codon is at the very end (TGA), so the ribosome should read through until that point, so the protein would be full length. Unless there's an internal stop codon.

Wait, but earlier in the sequence, is there a TGA or TAG or TAA?

Looking again: Let's scan the entire plus strand for any stop codons.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Looking through the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA TAC GCC AAT GCT TGG TCC GAA GAT TCT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, let's look for TGA specifically.

I see 'TGA' in here: ... TGG TCC GAA GAT TCT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, in the middle, there's 'TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Wait, looking for TGA: I don't see it except at the very end.

Wait, the last part is:

...CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

The last codon is AGA, which is arginine. Hmm, but the very end is TGA. Wait, perhaps I messed up the reading.

Wait, the plus strand ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would end with TGA. That's correct. So no internal stop codon. So why is the protein not expressed?

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. But without a stop codon in the middle, that shouldn't happen.

Option C: The lack of a linker is triggering proteolysis. So the HA tag might be missing a linker, making the protein prone to degradation. But the problem is about overexpression, not the functionality of the tag. If the HA tag isn't present, the purification might not work, but the construct would still express the protein. But the question is why can't they overexpress it. So maybe the HA tag isn't present, but the protein is expressed but not tagged, so they can't see it. But the problem is that they can't overexpress it. Alternatively, if the HA tag is missing, perhaps the gene is not properly expressed.

Wait, no. The HA tag is part of the coding sequence. If the HA sequence is there, the protein should be expressed with the tag. If the HA isn't present, perhaps the vector is incorrect, but the question says the HA sequence is introduced. But I'm not sure.

Option D: The mouse lacks the tRNA for the UAA codon. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. The tRNA doesn't recognize it; the release factor does. So if the mouse's tRNA for UAA doesn't exist, that shouldn't matter because UAA is a stop codon, not an amino acid.

Wait, the plus strand's sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So in the mRNA, it's ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would have the stop codon as UAG (since DNA is TGA, mRNA is complementary, so it's UAG). Wait, no, wait: DNA is plus strand, so mRNA is made from the complementary strand. So the mRNA's stop codon would be UAG.

Wait, but in the given plus strand, the coding sequence (for the protein) is on the plus strand, so the mRNA is complementary. So the mRNA would have the codon AUG (start) and end with UAG (stop). So UAG is a stop, which is recognized.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So the ribosomes are translating the mRNA, but perhaps the construct is not working.

Looking back at the options, option C is about the lack of linker causing proteolysis. Without a linker, maybe the HA tag isn't present, but the protein is being made. But if the protein is made but not HA-tagged, they can't purify it, but the expression level would be normal. But the question says they couldn't overexpress it.

Alternatively, maybe the construct is in the wrong reading frame. Let me check. The GADD45G's coding sequence starts with ATG, and the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC ... So that's the correct reading frame.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag might have a frame shift. If the HA sequence is inserted incorrectly, causing a frameshift mutation, the entire coding sequence would be wrong. Let's see: the HA tag is about 11 amino acids. So its DNA is about 33 nucleotides. Let me check the first 33 nucleotides:

Plus strand (5' to 3'):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA TAC GCC AAT 

Wait, that's 33 nucleotides? Let me count: 3 nucleotides per codon, 11 codons. 11 *3=33.

So codons 1-11: ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTC, CAG, ATT, ACC, GCA, GAA.

Translating these into amino acids:

1. Met (ATG)
2. Tyr (TAC)
3. Pro (CCA)
4. Tyr (TAC)
5. Asp (GAT)
6. Val (GTC)
7. Gln (CAG)
8. Ile (ATT)
9. Thr (ACC)
10. Ala (GCA)
11. Glu (GAA)

So that's the HA tag? Let me think about the actual HA tag sequence. I think the HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate that into codons (in frame):

YP: Tyr Pro → TAC CCA
YD: Tyr Asp → TAC GAT
VP: Val Pro → GTA CCA
DY: Asp Tyr → GAT TAC
PA: Pro Ala → CCA GCT

Wait, that's 5 codons for YPYDVPDYA? No, each amino acid is a codon. So 11 amino acids would be 11 codons.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. Or maybe longer. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is longer.

Wait, perhaps I got the HA tag wrong. Let me think again. The HA tag is an epitope from the influenza HA protein. The commonly used HA tag is 11 amino acids long: YPYDVPDYA. Wait, that's 9, but sometimes it's extended. Alternatively, maybe it's 8 amino acids: YPYDVPDY.

But in any case, the provided HA coding sequence starts with TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc. Let me see what that would look like.

So the first few amino acids from the HA tag are Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, ... Hmm, the HA tag should start with YPYDVP..., but according to the sequence, after Met comes Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, etc. That seems correct. So the HA tag sequence is correct.

Wait, but maybe the frame is wrong. For instance, if the HA tag is inserted in a different reading frame, the entire coding sequence would be messed up. Let me check the sequence. The HA sequence is in the correct frame, as the start codon is ATG, which is frame 0.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's reading frame is correct, but the GADD45G sequence is not. Or maybe the entire construct is in the wrong reading frame.

Wait, the provided sequence starts with ATG, so frame 0. So the HA is correct.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of a stop codon in the sequence. But earlier I thought there's no stop codon except at the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is correctly placed, but the GADD45G sequence is in the wrong reading frame. Or perhaps the plasmid is not correctly inserted. Alternatively, maybe the promoter is not correctly placed.

Wait, but the question is about the sequence of the plus strand. If the HA coding sequence is correct, and the GADD45G coding is correct, then why isn't the protein expressed.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag and GADD45G are directly joined, perhaps the protein is being recognized as a fusion that's targeted for degradation. But the question is whether the protein is overexpressed. If it's being degraded, the level would be lower.

But the problem is that the expression level is low. So if the HA is directly attached without a linker, perhaps the protein is being recognized as a fusion and degraded. But I'm not sure that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is correctly placed but the expression vector doesn't have a suitable promoter or the selection marker isn't working. But the question says they used antibiotic resistance, so that's probably fine.

Wait, another thought: the given DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand. The mRNA is complementary to this, so it's the same as the non-template strand. Since the construct is designed to express the HA-GADD45G fusion, the mRNA should be correctly generated.

Wait, perhaps the construct is missing the RBS (ribosome binding site). Without a RBS, the ribosome can't initiate translation, leading to no protein expression. But the question doesn't mention anything about the RBS, so I don't know.

Looking at the options, option B suggests the ribosome terminated early. But without an internal stop codon, that shouldn't happen.

Wait, another possibility: the ATG is not the first codon. Because in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, so that's the start. But perhaps the plasmid doesn't have a strong enough promoter or the ATG is not in frame with the promoter, leading to no expression.

Wait, but the construct is designed for inducible overexpression; perhaps the inducible promoter isn't working. But the question doesn't give info on that.

Another angle: Perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. For example, a termination codon right after the HA tag. But in the given sequence, the HA is followed by GADD45G, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is correctly there, but the GADD45G sequence is faulty. Maybe the GADD45G coding sequence has a frameshift or a premature stop. Let me look.

Looking at the sequence after the HA coding: The HA is 11 codons, then comes the GADD45G coding.

Wait, HA is 11 codons (33 nt) then comes GADD45G.

So the HA part is codons 1-11, and the GADD45G starts at codon 12.

Let's see codon 12: after the HA, the next codons are:

After codon 11 (GAA, Glu) comes G T C (Val), then CAG (Gln), ATT (Ile), ACC (Thr), GAA (Glu), TAC (Tyr), etc.

So the GADD45G sequence starts with Val Gln Ile Thr Glu Tyr ... Wait, but the GADD45G's amino acids should be known. Do they start with Val, Gln, etc.? I'm not sure, but perhaps this is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag has a stop codon in it. Let me check the HA part for any TGA, TAG, or TAA.

In the HA coding sequence (codons 1-11):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA.

Wait, any stop codons? TAA is not present. TAG is not present. TGA is not in these 11 codons.

So the HA coding is fine.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is correctly placed but the plasmid is in the antisense orientation. So the construct is not being transcribed. But the given sequence is the plus strand, so if the plasmid is correctly oriented, the mRNA would be correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's start is correct, but the GADD45G sequence has a premature stop codon. So the protein is truncated, leading to lower expression or degradation.

But in the given sequence, after the HA, the GADD45G sequence is continuing without a premature stop.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is correctly placed, but the GADD45G's coding sequence ends before the stop codon. So the HA is present, but the GADD45G is not properly expressed.

Wait, the given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the fusion protein isn't stable. But the question is about overexpression, not stability.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag causes the ribosome to terminate translation. But why would that happen? The HA is part of the coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the HA tag introduced a cryptic termination signal or a stop codon in the mRNA. But in the given sequence, the HA is correctly placed, and the stop is at the end.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me consider the options again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would require a stop codon upstream, but I don't see any except the last one.

Option C: The lack of a linker is triggering proteolysis. If the HA and GADD45G are directly connected, perhaps the protein is being recognized as a foreign protein and degraded. But the question is about expression levels, not stability. And the construct is in CHO cells, which might not have the same proteases as mouse cells.

Wait, the person is using CHO cells for transfection. They're testing expression. So if the HA tag is present but the protein is unstable, the levels would be low. But the question says they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the expression is low because the protein is being degraded.

But the option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So adding a linker between HA and GADD45G would prevent that. But in the given construct, there's no linker, so the protein might be prone to proteolysis, leading to lower detected levels.

But in the question, the person couldn't overexpress the protein. So if the HA is causing the protein to be degraded, the expression level would be lower than expected. That would fit option C.

But the question is about the inability to overexpress, not the functionality of the protein. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag isn't allowing the ribosome to properly translate the entire sequence, but I don't see why that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, but earlier analysis shows it doesn't.

Wait, another angle: the HA tag is in the correct frame, but the GADD45G is in a different frame due to a mutation. Let me check.

The HA is 11 codons, then GADD45G starts. Let's see, after the HA, the next codon is GTC (Val) — which is correct. So the frame continues correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the construct has an intron that's not spliced correctly, but the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the selection process is flawed. But the question says they used antibiotic resistance, which should select for the transfected cells.

Hmm. I'm going in circles.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because without a linker, the HA tag might cause the protein to be recognized as a target for proteolysis, leading to lower expression levels. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag causes a frameshift if not properly inserted, but the sequence seems correct.

Another thought: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it's part of the fusion protein. If the HA tag is not correctly inserted, maybe the ribosome can't read through, but in this case, the HA is in the correct frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is added in the wrong orientation. Like, the HA sequence is in the reverse complement, leading to a reversed HA tag. But the question says the HA is at the N-terminus, so the sequence should be in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is correctly inserted, but the GADD45G coding sequence is not correctly appended. Looking at the sequence, it's all one continuous ORF.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cloning introduced a mutation in the Kozak sequence, which is important for initiation in mammalian cells. The Kozak sequence is around the start codon and includes nucleotides like 'CC' before the ATG. If the Kozak sequence is disrupted, translation initiation is inefficient.

Looking at the sequence: the start is ATG TAC CCA... So the nucleotides before ATG are probably part of the promoter or other regions, but without knowing the exact context, it's hard to say. If the Kozak sequence is missing, the ribosome can't initiate properly, leading to low expression.

But the question doesn't mention anything about the Kozak sequence, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, going back to the options, the correct answer is likely option B, but I'm not sure. Or option C.

Wait, another angle: in the given sequence, the HA coding is correct, but the GADD45G coding is in the wrong reading frame. Let me count the nucleotides after HA.

HA is 33 nt (11 codons). So the next codon starts at position 34.

Looking at the sequence: position 34 is G T C (codon 12: Val).

But the GADD45G coding sequence should have a specific reading frame. If the HA and GADD45G are in the same frame, then the sequence is correct. But if the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, the GADD45G would be scrambled.

But the given sequence has the HA followed by GADD45G, which suggests they're in the same frame.

Wait, but perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, causing a frameshift. Let me see: the HA is 33 nt, which is divisible by 3, so no frameshift.

So the HA is 11 codons, then the GADD45G starts correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not followed by a proper start codon for the GADD45G. But the GADD45G starts with ATG, which is the start codon.

Wait, no, the HA is part of the fusion protein, so after the HA, the GADD45G starts, so the ATG is already at the beginning.

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag introduces a stop codon in the mRNA. But that's not the case, as the HA is correctly placed.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the mRNA before the end. But the only stop codon is at the end. So this is unlikely.

Option C: The lack of a linker causes proteolysis. So the HA and GADD45G are directly connected, leading the protein to be recognized as a target for proteases, thus leading to lower levels of the protein. So the expression is low because the protein is being degraded.

But in the question, the person couldn't overexpress the protein. So perhaps the construct is not working, leading to lower expression. If the HA tag isn't present, maybe the protein isn't expressed. But the HA is part of the coding sequence, so if it's absent, the protein isn't made. But the given sequence includes the HA, so it's expressed.

Alternatively, the HA tag might cause the ribosome to stop. But I don't see how. HA is part of the protein.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is correctly inserted, but the GADD45G sequence has a nonsense mutation. Let me look for stop codons in the GADD45G part.

Looking through the sequence beyond the HA:

After HA, the GADD45G starts with GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA GAA TAC GCC AAT GCT TGG TCC GAA GAT TCT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC G TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT A TCG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC G GCG GAC CTC GCA CTG C ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC G C CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CT TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA C CTC CCC CGA GTG AGA.

Looking for TAG, TAA, TGA.

I see TGA at the very end. So the only stop codon is at the end.

Wait, but looking earlier: in the middle, is there a TGA?

Looking: ... CGA GTG AGA ... No. So no internal stop codons.

Wait, what about the beginning? The start is ATG, correct.

Hmm.

Another thought: the presence of a termination codon in the vector's multiple cloning site could cause premature termination. But the sequence doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ATG is not functional because it's in the wrong context. For instance, maybe the ATG is after a non-A or non-G nucleotide, making it a weaker start codon. But that's less likely.

After all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C: the lack of the linker is causing the nascent chain to be proteolyzed. So the HA tag is directly attached to GADD45G without a linker, leading the protein to be recognized as a target for proteolysis, hence lower expression levels. So the person can't overexpress it because the protein is being degraded.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate translation. But I don't see a mechanism for that.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag might have a stop codon if the reading frame shifts. Let me see: the HA is 11 codons, but if the frame shifts, the HA would be in a different reading frame. But the provided sequence is in the correct frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA is correctly in frame, but the GADD45G coding sequence has a frameshift. Let me check the length.

The GADD45G coding sequence is after the HA. Let me see how many codons are in the GADD45G part.

The entire construct is the HA followed by GADD45G, ending with TGA. So the GADD45G sequence is correctly in frame.

Hmm.

After all this, I'm starting to think that the most plausible option is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein cannot be overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. The provided sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) followed by the HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence, ending with a stop codon (TGA). Despite this, the protein is not being overexpressed, and the task is to determine the likely cause.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   The HA tag sequence appears to be correctly inserted in the correct reading frame. The first few codons (TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTC, etc.) correspond to the expected amino acids for the HA tag. There is no evidence of a missense mutation that would disrupt the HA tag or prevent translation. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   The sequence does not contain any internal stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) before the final stop codon at the end. The ribosome should translate the entire sequence without terminating early. This option is also unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   The HA tag is directly fused to the GADD45G coding sequence without a linker. This direct fusion could make the protein prone to proteolysis, as the lack of a linker might create a recognition site for proteases. If the protein is degraded, its expression levels would appear lower than expected. This is a plausible explanation for the observed issue.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   The sequence ends with a stop codon (TGA), not UAA. Additionally, the absence of tRNA for UAA is irrelevant because UAA is not part of the coding sequence. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the lack of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G is causing proteolysis of the nascent protein, leading to reduced expression levels. This aligns with the observed inability to overexpress the protein.
