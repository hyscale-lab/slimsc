Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So, the particles are only in that region. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function provided is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Normally, a wave function would be written as a sum of real and imaginary parts, but both parts are functions of x. But here, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, that's interesting. So the imaginary part is a constant?

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So, it's a complex function. The real part depends on x, and the imaginary part is a constant. That's a bit unusual, but I'll go with it.

So, the square of the absolute value is |ψ|^2 = [Re(ψ)]^2 + [Im(ψ)]^2. Because for a complex number, the absolute square is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Since 0.5² is 0.25.

Now, the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3. So when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the probability should be zero. Wait, but according to the given wave function, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), but the imaginary part is fixed. So what's the condition for the wave function to be zero outside 1 and 3?

Wait, no, the wave function isn't zero outside that region. Because the wave function's real part would be a/sqrt(1+x). So when x <1, say x=0, the denominator is sqrt(1+0)=1, so the real part is a. But the imaginary part is -0.5i. So the wave function isn't zero outside the region. But according to the problem statement, when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function must be zero outside that region. But the given ψ(x) isn't zero outside 1 to 3. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I misread the wave function.

Wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. But that doesn't seem to vanish outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the actual wave function is non-zero only in that interval. Hmm, but the given ψ(x) doesn't seem to have that property. So perhaps the wave function is only defined in that interval, and zero otherwise. Maybe the given ψ is part of a piecewise function, but the question only gives that part.

Wait, the question says that in a part of space where the particle can exist, the wave function is as given. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So in that case, the wave function given is for 1<=x<=3, and zero elsewhere.

But in that case, the overall wave function would be ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1<=x<=3, and zero otherwise. So the absolute square would be (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 in that interval, and zero outside.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky because the integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1. So let's set up the integral for normalization.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral is ∫(from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral step by step.

First, integrate (a²)/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So integrating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So that part is a² * ln(2).

Next, integrate 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Then, solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Hmm, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait a minute, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, so the absolute square is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. So that's a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So the first term: a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

Which is a² * ln( (1+3)/(1+1) ) = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2).

The second term: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.5.

So equation: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is indeed about 0.85. So the correct answer should be option B) 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is restricted to the region \( x \in [1, 3] \). The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This splits into two terms:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \), so:

   \[
   a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \).  
   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
