Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. I need to figure out what Compound X is first and then determine what reaction it undergoes under those conditions.

Let me start by looking at the spectral data provided. The IR and NMR data will help me identify the functional groups and the structure of Compound X.

First, the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm⁻¹ usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since we have a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, which is around the range for a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid). Wait, but a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch is strong and broad, which matches the 3400–2500 region. The 1720 could be a carbonyl group. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions might be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound is a substituted aromatic carboxylic acid? Or perhaps an ester or ketone?

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a very broad peak around 3000-2500, which it does. The 1720 could be a carbonyl. But wait, another possibility is that the compound has both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, maybe an ester? Let me think. Ester carbonyls are typically around 1720-1740. So maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a strong deshielded proton. Could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10. But a carboxylic acid would have an O-H, which is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the NMR, the integration is 1H for that peak. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, which matches the description (bs, 1H). Also, the 10.5 ppm is a bit high for an aldehyde, but maybe that's possible.

Then at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet integrates to 2H, so probably two sets of protons in the aromatic ring. The 8.0 ppm is more deshielded, so maybe it's next to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So the substituent is at the para position, perhaps a carbonyl group.

Then the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – another multiplet, perhaps two CH2 groups. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet of 3H, which is likely a CH3 group attached to a CH or something. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a triplet from a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together: aromatic ring, para-substituted with something that has a carbonyl group. The substituent is probably a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is probably the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So the substituent is a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group in the para position. But let me think about the other groups.

The other groups in the NMR: the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ester group? Or maybe a CH that's part of a side chain.

The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) might be a CH2 group, next to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH2CH3 group. So maybe there's a chain attached to the aromatic ring, like a substituent with a chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-C(O)OH, or maybe a longer chain connected via an oxygen, but let me think.

Wait, the starting compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is that they are used for the elimination of a hydroxyl group in a substitution reaction, like in the formation of alkenes. Alternatively, if the compound is a nitrile, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another reaction: when a compound has a carbonyl group and an adjacent leaving group, under certain conditions, it can undergo a reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride reacting, but not sure.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. So maybe Compound X is an ester, and when reacted with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's re-examine the IR data. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester (C=O). So if the compound is an ester, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if it's a nitrile, but I don't think so because the IR doesn't have the nitrile peak (~2200 cm⁻¹). So more likely an ester.

So, looking at the NMR again: the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which is not typical for an ester. Esters don't have O-H groups, so maybe that's not it. So maybe the 10.5 is something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But then, the IR would have a peak around 1720 which would be a carbonyl (the aldehyde). But wait, aldehydes have strong absorption around 2800-2700 (stretching for the C-H) and a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. So in IR, 1720 could fit an aldehyde.

But if the structure has an aldehyde group, that would make sense with the 10.5 ppm peak.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak (1H), which is broad. Aldehydes usually show sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm. A broad peak might suggest exchange, which is more typical of O-H (like in carboxylic acids). So maybe not an aldehyde.

Hmm, conflicting possibilities here. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the substituents on the benzene ring.

The aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. The substituent is likely an electron-withdrawing group because the protons adjacent would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, substituents like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, etc.

If the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another group, such as a ketone, ester, or acid.

Wait, the IR has a 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So it's an aromatic ring with substituents that have electron-withdrawing groups.

So, looking at the NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the substituent is at the para position, and the ring has two sets of protons, each adjacent to the substituent.

So, the substituent could be a carbonyl group, which would cause the adjacent protons to be more deshielded and appear upfield or downfield. Wait, in para-substituted benzene, if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, like nitro or carbonyl, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

So the protons ortho to the substituent would be deshielded, appearing at higher ppm. For example, in nitrobenzene, the ortho protons are around 8.2 ppm. In benzoic acid, the ortho protons are around 7.5-8.0 ppm. So in this case, the 8.0 ppm is the ortho protons, and the 7.2 ppm would be the meta. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are in two sets: the two ortho (next to substituent) and the two meta (across). But wait, in NMR, for para substitution, the substituent is at position 1, and the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is the para position (but that's the substituent in this case). Wait, no, para substituent is at position 4 if the substituent is at position 1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and the ring has two sets of protons: the two ortho (positions 3 and 5) and the two para (positions 2 and 6). Or perhaps I should think in terms of coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at the para position, and each pair of protons is ortho and meta. Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. So the structure is something like para-substituted benzoyl group attached to a side chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone. So, the structure is something like p-acylbenzene, but with a side chain attached.

Wait, looking at the non-aromatic protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group adjacent to something.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH (like a geminal substituent).
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH3 group.

So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a ketone (CO-) attached to a chain. Wait, but wait, if the substituent is a ketone, the structure would be Ar-CO-R, where R is a chain. Alternatively, it could be an ester group, Ar-CO-O-R.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a puzzle. If it's a carbonyl group as part of a ketone or ester, why is there a peak at 10.5?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to a side chain. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Looking at the NMR data again, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which suggests an O-H. Let's say it's a carboxylic acid. So the substituent is a -COOH group.

But then, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ would not be a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have O-H (broad, around 2500-3300) and C=O around 1700. Wait, but 1720 is a bit higher, which would suggest an ester or possibly an acid chloride (but no, acid chloride would have a higher C=O and other peaks). So if it's a carboxylic acid, the C=O would be around 1700. So the IR at 1720 is a bit higher, perhaps an ester.

Hmm, but then the 10.5 in the NMR can't be an O-H, because esters don't have O-H. So perhaps the 10.5 is something else. Maybe an aldehyde? But aldehydes have sharp peaks around 9-10.5 ppm. But the peak is broad, which may not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchangeable proton, but not O-H. Maybe it's an NH group, but the IR doesn't show an NH stretch, unless it's a secondary amide, but that doesn't fit the 1720 cm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm isn't part of the aromatic ring. Maybe it's a vinylic proton, but that doesn't explain the broadness. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, and the 1720 is an ester elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzoic acid ester. So it's a benzene ring with an ester group. For example, ethyl benzoate. But in that case, the ester group would be O-CO-O-R.

But let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is a propionyl group attached to a chain, perhaps.

Let me try to draw this structure. The benzene ring is para-substituted with a group that has a carbonyl. Let's say the substituent is a ketone. So it's Ar-CO-R. Then, R could be a side chain.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), and 0.9 (3H) suggest a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO Ar. Wait, let me think. The 0.9 is a triplet, which would be a terminal CH2CH3. So, perhaps it's a propyl group, but the 3H is a triplet, so maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3, but the 0.9 ppm is a triplet from CH2CH3.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH3 group attached to another CH2. So, maybe the structure is something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-Ar, where Ar is the benzene ring.

Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-Ar, the CH2 would be next to the CH.

Putting it together: the substituent on the benzene ring is a ketone (CO-) attached to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2 and a CH2CH3. So the substituent would be a ketone with a side chain of CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, perhaps it's a (propan-2-yl) group attached via a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is (propan-2-yl) ketone. So the substituent would be -(CO)-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, no, the NMR doesn't seem to fit that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the substituent is -(CO)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's something like -(CO)-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the possible products. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So the options are either substituted benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings without functional groups.

Wait, if the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is typically used for dehydrohalogenation or for hydrolysis of esters to acids, or for elimination reactions.

Looking at option C and A, they are benzoic acids. Options B and D are substituted toluenes, without functional groups. So if the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then the starting material would be an ester, and the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if it's an elimination reaction, perhaps the starting material has a leaving group adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to formation of an alkene.

Wait, considering the NMR data again: the 10.5 ppm could be a carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and a COOH group at the para position. Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be more accurately, the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

Wait, no. Wait, if it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituents would be at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). But in that case, the ring would have substituents in meta positions, which would not give the NMR pattern we have. Because the aromatic protons would be split into more peaks.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. So the COOH would be at position 1, and the sec-butyl at position 4, but that makes them para to each other. So the ring would have two substituents, each at opposite ends.

In that case, the ring would have two sets of protons: the ortho to COOH and the ortho to the sec-butyl group. Wait, but the NMR shows only two doublets, each integrating 2H. That would happen if the substituents are para and cause the adjacent protons to split into two doublets.

So for option C: the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. The protons ortho to COOH would be deshielded (downfield), and those ortho to the sec-butyl would be less deshielded. So the NMR would show two sets of doublets, which matches the data.

But looking at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So one set is more downfield than the other. That suggests that the substituents are in the para position, with one being an electron-withdrawing group (like COOH) causing the ortho protons to be downfield, and the other substituent (sec-butyl) is an electron-donating group, causing its ortho protons to be less downfield.

So in option C, the structure would be a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. Then the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield (around 8.0 ppm), and the protons ortho to the sec-butyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be at a higher ppm than typical but perhaps around 7.2 ppm.

That matches the NMR data.

Wait, but what about the substituent groups in the NMR. The non-aromatic protons would include the CH group from the sec-butyl and the CH2 groups.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) attached to the ring. Let's see:

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait. The structure is:

The substituent R is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-? No, that's isobutyl. Wait, no. Let me think.

Butyl groups can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-
- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-
- tert-butyl: C(CH3)3-

Wait, no. Wait, the sec-butyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that's not right. The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the substituent as being attached to the ring via a CH2 group, followed by a CH, which branches to two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the NMR data. The non-aromatic protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group attached to two other CH2 groups.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons, perhaps a CH2 adjacent to the CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH3 group.

So, the structure could be a CH group connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d), and the CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t). So the structure is CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a butyl group, but it depends on how it's attached.

Wait, another approach: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is likely a CH3 attached to a CH, which is split into a doublet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH2CH3, suggesting a propyl chain.

Putting this together, the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH2CH3) and another CH2 group. Hmm, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. But wait, let's think about the possible products again.

If the original compound is a benzoic acid ester, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. For example, ethyl benzoate would become benzoic acid. But in our case, the substituent is more complex.

Wait, let's consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have the COOH group on the benzene ring, and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets (ortho to COOH and ortho to sec-butyl).
- The substituent (sec-butyl) would have protons in the NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2?. No, perhaps I'm confusing the substituent.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, perhaps I should consider the substituent as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. But wait, that's three carbons, which is not correct for butyl.

Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. But in that case, it's a three-carbon group, which would be a propyl group, not butyl. Hmm, getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the NMR data must fit. Let's see:

The non-aromatic protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a CH connected to two CH2 groups.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group next to a CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, but let me count the carbons.

Wait, wait. Let me think of it as:

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. For example, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that would require a quaternary carbon. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

But in that case, the CH would have two CH2 groups attached. Let me see the NMR:

- The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH2 attached to it would be at 1.7 (m, 2H), and the CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 (d, 3H). The terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but how is it attached to the benzene? If the substituent is a ketone, then the structure would be Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene via a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a tertiary butyl group. But that would have a different NMR pattern.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a ketone. So, the substituent would be Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a ketone attached to a propyl chain. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would suggest an O-H, which doesn't fit a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to think about the reaction. The starting material reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm pretty sure that red phosphorus and HI are used for hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, if the starting material is an nitrile, it might undergo hydrolysis, but the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Another possibility is that the starting material is an acyl chloride, but again, the IR doesn't show a peak around 1800 cm⁻¹, which is typical for acid chlorides.

Wait, another reaction: when an ester reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it's likely undergoing hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. So the starting compound X is an ester, and upon reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Looking back at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. So, the product would be a carboxylic acid, so the starting material would be an ester.

So, let's think about the structure of the ester. The ester would have a benzene ring with an ester group (COOR) attached para to another group.

The substituent on the benzene would be an ester group, so the structure would be Ar-CO-O-R.

The NMR data would need to show the ester's structure. The 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR of X would not be present if it's an ester because esters don't have O-H. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is due to something else, like an aldehyde or an amide.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 is an aldehyde proton. Then the substituent would be a benzaldehyde derivative with an ester group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an exchangeable proton, such as an NH group, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the 10.5 ppm is a vinylic proton, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an O-H from a phenol group. But phenols have O-H stretches around 3000-2500 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR. But the IR also has a 1720 cm⁻¹, which would suggest an ester or ketone.

Wait, if the starting material is a phenyl ester with a hydroxyl group elsewhere, perhaps. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to a chain, making the structure Ar-CO-R, where R is a chain.

Given the NMR data, perhaps the structure is:

Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group attached to the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to analyze the NMR of option C.

If the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the benzene ring would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

The aromatic protons would be the two ortho to COOH (more deshielded, around 8.0 ppm) and the two ortho to the sec-butyl group (less deshielded, around 7.2 ppm). The meta protons would be absent because the substituents are para. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

The non-aromatic protons would come from the sec-butyl group. Let's see:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with a COOH group and a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group attached at para positions.

So, the substituent is a four-carbon group attached to the benzene via a CH2 group. The substituent would have the following structure: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group.

The NMR for the substituent would include:

- The CH2 group adjacent to the benzene (attached to the benzene via CH2) would have protons that are split into a quartet or triplet, depending on neighboring groups. But in the data, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be this CH2 group.

- The CH group attached to the benzene's CH2 would have two CH3 groups attached. Wait, no, because a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that would be a four-carbon substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense for a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, which would be an iso-butyl group. Hmm.

If the substituent is iso-butyl, then the NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups attached to the CH. But in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene via a CH2 group, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But the NMR doesn't fit that because a tert-butyl would have a singlet at around 1.2 ppm for the nine protons.

Wait, going back to the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the COOH is at the para position.

In that case, the substituent (sec-butyl) would have the structure -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, but that would require five carbons, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, which is a four-carbon substituent. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent group would have a CH2 group attached to the benzene, then a CH group attached to a CH2CH3 and another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, which would be a three-carbon substituent, but that's a propyl group, not butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is a four-carbon substituent (butyl group). But then, the NMR would have to fit that.

In that case, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene: their protons would be at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH group attached to two CH2 groups: protons at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH3 groups: one attached to the CH group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H) and another as a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, making it a sec-butyl group.

Thus, the structure of compound X would be a benzoic acid ester, where the benzene has a COOR group and a substituent. Upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, the ester would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be the product if the starting compound was an ester of benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

But wait, if the starting compound is an ester, its structure would be Ar-CO-O-R, where R is a substituent.

Wait, but the NMR data for the starting compound would include the ester's O-R group. For example, the 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen, and the 0.9 ppm (3H) would be the terminal CH2CH3.

So, perhaps the starting material is the ester, and after hydrolysis, it becomes the benzoic acid.

Wait, but then the product would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the reaction would take the ester and convert it into the carboxylic acid.

But looking at the NMR of compound X, the 10.5 ppm peak is a problem. Because the ester wouldn't have that peak. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not from the starting material but from the product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrolysis. Another possibility is that the starting material is a nitrile, but no. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a compound has a carbonyl group and a good leaving group adjacent to it, it can undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. For example, if it's a beta-hydroxy ketone, it could eliminate water to form an alkene.

But in that case, the reaction would need a base, and red phosphorus with HI isn't typically a base. Unless HI is acting as an acid catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amides.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a benzyl ester with a leaving group adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, Ar-CO-O-R, where R has a leaving group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a bromine adjacent to a carbonyl, and the reaction is an elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes via the elimination of HX. For example, in the dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide to form an alkene.

But in that case, the starting material would have a halogen adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an allylic halide, which upon elimination with HI would form an alkene.

But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm, perhaps I should make a decision based on the NMR data and the options.

The NMR of the starting material suggests a structure with a para-substituted benzene, a carbonyl group (from IR), and a side chain with a terminal CH2CH3 group.

The reaction conditions suggest hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, so the product would be a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if the starting material was the ester, then the product would be option C.

But then, the starting material's NMR would have an ester group, which would have an O-R group's protons, which in the starting material's NMR would include the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) for the terminal CH2CH3.

So, putting it all together, the final product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the spectral data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H or N-H stretch. Given the absence of N-containing functional groups, this is likely an O-H group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid, ester, or ketone.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring with electron-withdrawing substituents.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals suggest a chain of carbons attached to the benzene ring, with a terminal CH2CH3 group.

### Reaction Conditions:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. This suggests that Compound X is likely an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group and the correct substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a substituted benzene without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure fits the data:
   - The benzene ring is para-substituted with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group.
   - The aromatic protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) match the expected splitting for a para-substituted benzene.
   - The non-aromatic protons (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) correspond to the sec-butyl group.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a substituted benzene without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The reaction converts an ester into a carboxylic acid, and the spectral data matches **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. Therefore, the final product is:

**Answer: C**
