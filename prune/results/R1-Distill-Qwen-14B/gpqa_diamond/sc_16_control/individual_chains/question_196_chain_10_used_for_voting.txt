Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, and has mass m and maximum amplitude A. The speed of light is c. The options are four different expressions, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, wait, wait. I remember that in classical mechanics, for a simple harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But this is a relativistic case, so things are different. Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Oh right, in the relativistic case, the equations of motion change because of the effects of special relativity. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. I think the total energy includes relativistic effects.

In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)mv²_max, which is also equal to (1/2)kA² because the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic option, which is option C. But wait, the question is about relativistic, so option C is probably incorrect.

So in the relativistic scenario, the energy is higher because kinetic energy increases more than quadratically with speed. The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but since this is a classical problem, I think E is just the total mechanical energy, which has to account for relativistic effects.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case would be the rest mass energy plus the relativistic kinetic energy. So at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is gamma m c² minus m c squared.

Wait, let me think again. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c² / 2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait no, wait. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma m c². At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest (momentarily), so x = A, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2) k A². At maximum speed, all energy is kinetic, so E = gamma m c².

Wait, but wait, no. Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy. So when the oscillator is at x=0, it has maximum kinetic energy.

So at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should write down the energy expressions. So total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at x=A. Then at x=0, all this energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E = (1/2)kA².

Wait no, because in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is E_k = (gamma - 1) m c². So E = E_k + E_potential. But at x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that would mean that at x=0, all E is kinetic, so E_kinetic = (1/2)kA².

So (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Solve for gamma. Hmm, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's rewrite:

gamma = 1 + (1/(2m c²)) (k A²).

Wait, no: (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me do the algebra correctly.

E = (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma - 1 = (k A²) / (2 m c²)

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)

But wait, that can't be right because if k A² is large compared to m c², gamma would get very big, but that's possible in some cases.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (gamma m c² - m c²).

So the total energy is (gamma m c² - m c²) + (1/2) k x² = E.

At maximum x, x = A, velocity is zero. So E = (gamma m c² - m c²) + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in that case, E would depend on gamma, which depends on velocity, but when x is maximum, velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = (m c² - m c²) + (1/2)k A² → E = (1/2)k A². So that's correct.

At maximum velocity, x is zero, so potential energy is zero. So E = (gamma m c² - m c²) + 0 → gamma m c² - m c² = E = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = (E + m c²) / (m c²)

gamma = ( (1/2)k A² + m c² ) / (m c² )

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

At maximum velocity (x=0), the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c² = E = (1/2)kA².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Yes.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²) )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

We can solve for v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a variable for simplicity, say, let's call it a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a )

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a )^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2.

Factor:

1 - [1/( (1+a)^2 ) ] = [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

So,

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1+a)^2

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a ) / (1 +a )^2 ]

Substituting a:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Let me simplify the numerator and denominator.

Let me write all terms:

Numerator inside the brackets: [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) ]

Denominator: [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) ]²

Let me factor out (k A²/(2 m c² )) in the numerator.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = a again for a moment.

So,

Numerator: a (2 + a )

Denominator: (1 + a )²

So,

v² = c² * [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2

= c² * a (2 +a ) / (1+a )²

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) ] / [ 1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ]^2

Let me compute each part:

First, note that 2 + a = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Factor out 1/(2 m c² ) from a, but perhaps it's easier to write 2 as (4 m c² )/(2 m c² ), so 2 = 4 m c²/(2 m c² )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: a (2 +a ) = (k A²)/(2 m c² ) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

Denominator: (1 +a )² = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2

So,

Putting it all together:

v² = c² * [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 m c² )^2 to eliminate denominators.

But perhaps a better approach is to factor the expression.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the expression inside the square brackets.

Let me write it as:

[ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2

= [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )²

= a (2 +a ) / (1 +a )^2

Hmm, perhaps we can factor 2 + a as 1 + a +1.

But not sure. Alternatively, expand the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write a as (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) * ( 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) ) ] / [ ( 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) )^2 ]

Let me compute the numerator:

= (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) ]

= (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 ) / ( 2 m c² ) ) ]

Wait, because 2 is 2*(2 m c² )/(2 m c² ) ) = 4 m c²/(2 m c² )? No, maybe I should compute 2 + a where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

2 + a = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) = (4 m c² + k A^2 )/( 2 m c² )

So,

Numerator becomes:

(k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 )/( 2 m c² ) )

= (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator:

(1 + a )^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) ]^2

= (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

Putting together:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Simplify the denominators:

The denominator in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) * (4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

The (4 m² c^4 ) terms cancel.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

Let me factor 4 m c² + k A^2 as 4 m c² + k A² = (2 m c² ) *2 + k A². Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively,

Let me see if I can factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c² + k A^2 ) (2 m c² + k A^2 )

Hmm, perhaps 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c² ), but I don't see a clear factorization.

Wait, perhaps let me write:

Let me denote b = 2 m c² + k A^2.

Then,

4 m c² + k A^2 = 2 m c² + (2 m c² + k A^2 ) = 2 m c² + b.

So,

Numerator becomes k A^2 (2 m c² + b )

Denominator is b².

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (2 m c² + b ) / (b²) ]

= c² * [ k A^2 (2 m c² + b ) ] / b²

But I'm not sure this helps. Maybe I should instead look for an alternative approach.

Wait another approach: Let me take the expression for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

And then,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Let me square both sides:

(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c² )

Invert both sides:

1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) = 1 - v²/c²

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Wait, that's the same as earlier. So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Let me compute 1 - 1/(something)^2.

Let me write it as:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 -1 ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which simplifies to:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ) ]

The numerator is (something squared minus 1), which factors into (something -1)(something +1).

So,

( (1 + a )^2 -1 ) = (a (a + 2) ), where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, let me compute (1 + a )^2 -1.

= 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 +a ) ] / (1 +a )^2

Which brings me back to the same expression as before.

So, perhaps I should write it in terms of a, but I'm trying to see which option this corresponds to.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m )) )^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) )

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute v_max.

v² = c² [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 +a )², where a = k A²/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a(2 +a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 + a )

Because sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) is sqrt( numerator ), and denominator is (1+a ) squared, so sqrt is (1 + a )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )

But a = k A²/(2 m c² )

Let me plug that in:

sqrt(a (2 +a )) = sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out (1/(2 m c² )) from the terms inside.

Wait,

= sqrt( (k A²) * (2 * 2 m c² + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c² )

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the expression inside the square root:

a (2 +a ) = [k A²/(2 m c² )] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

= [k A²/(2 m c² ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 ) / (2 m c² ) ]

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So, sqrt( this ) is sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c² )

= [ A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) ) ] / (2 m c² )

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I'm going about it the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I can write the expression for v_max as:

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / ( 1 + a )

But a is (k A² )/( 2 m c² )

Let me compute (1 + a ) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / ( [2 m c² + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) * (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, but this still doesn't look like any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should express this in terms of gamma.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look at the options and see which one could be rearranged to match.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m) ))^2 )

Wait, that seems dimensionally inconsistent. Because (k A^2/(2 m )) is ( (kg/s²)(m²) )/( kg ) ) = (m^2 s^-2 ) / (kg ) ? Wait, no. Let me compute the units:

k is N/m = kg s^-2.

A^2 is m².

So, numerator is kg s^-2 * m² = kg m² s^-2.

Denominator is 2m, which is kg.

So overall, (k A^2 )/(2m) is (kg m² s^-2 ) / kg ) = m² s^-2. But 1/(1 - x )^2 must have x dimensionless, so for 1 - (k A^2)/(2m) to be dimensionless, (k A^2)/(2m) must be dimensionless.

Wait, but (k A^2)/(2m) has units of (kg m² s^-2)/( kg ) ) = m² s^-2, which isn't dimensionless. So Option A can't be correct because the expression inside the sqrt has non-dimensionless terms.

Similarly, looking at Option B: 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Wait, (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is (kg m^2 s^-2 )/( kg * (m^2 s^-2 ) )) = dimensionless. So that's okay.

Option B's expression inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

But wait, in our case, we have v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) )/(1 +a )

Which is v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (2+a) ] ) / (1 +a )

So, let me compute [ a (2+a ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

From our earlier steps,

v_max² = c² [ a(2+a) ]/(1 +a )²

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a(2+a) ]/(1+a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ a(2+a) ] ) / (1 +a )

But I'm not sure how that would map to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write [ a (2+a) ] / (1 +a )² as [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 = [ (a (2 +a ) ) ] / (1 +a )^2

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find a common denominator.

Wait, looking back at the four options, perhaps only options A, B, D have terms involving kA^2/(2m c^2 ), which is the relativistic correction.

Option C is the non-relativistic solution, which is v_max = sqrt( k A²/m ), so it's out.

So, let's look at these three options.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m )) )² )

But as discussed, the units are wrong in the denominator.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, but 1 + 1/(1 - x ) is not the same as our expression. Our expression is sqrt( a (2 +a ) )/(1 +a )

Option D: sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Hmm, let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ] where x is (kA²/(2 m c^2 )).

So,

1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ] / (1 +x )^2

= [1 + 2x +x² -1 ] / (1+x )²

= (2x +x² ) / (1+x )² = x (2 +x )/(1 +x )^2

Which matches exactly what we have in our v_max² expression.

Because,

v_max² = c² [ a (2 +a ) ]/(1 +a )^2

Where a = (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

Therefore,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a ) ]/(1 +a )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( [ (a (2+a )) / (1+a )² ] )

Which is c * sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1+a )^2 )

But 2a + a² = a (2 +a )

So,

sqrt( (a (2 +a )) / (1 +a )^2 ) = sqrt( a(2+a ) ) / (1 +a )

But from the option D, the expression under the square root is 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2, which is exactly [ a (2 +a ) ]/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a ) ]/(1 +a )^2 )

Which is the same as c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 )

Which matches option D's expression.

Wait, let's check. Option D says:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Yes, because:

1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 = [ (1 +a )^2 -1 ]/(1 +a )^2 = (2a + a² )/(1 +a )^2 = a (2 +a )/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v_max²= c² * [ a (2 +a )/(1 +a )^2 ] = c² * [ 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 ]

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 )

Which is exactly what option D says.

So the correct answer is option D.

Let me quickly recapitulate what each option says.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches our derived expression.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At maximum speed \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic, given by \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at maximum displacement and maximum speed, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

The Lorentz factor is also related to the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \gamma \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Squaring both sides and rearranging, we find:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve dimensionally inconsistent terms or incorrect relativistic corrections.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic result, which assumes kinetic energy is \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
