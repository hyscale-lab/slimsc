Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant (h-bar). The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

Wait, but sometimes I also see the formula written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2π. Oh right, that's another version. So the product of ΔE and Δt should be at least ħ over 2π. Let me think about what that means for this problem.

The lifetimes given are the lifetimes of the quantum states, so I suppose that's the uncertainty in time, Δt. But wait, each state has a different lifetime. Hmm, how does that work? Or maybe the Δt in the uncertainty principle is the time it takes for the energy to change or to distinguish between the states.

Wait, no. The problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So perhaps the uncertainty in energy ΔE needs to be larger than some minimum value based on the time over which we can observe the energy. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing concepts here.

Wait, the energy difference ΔE between the two states must be such that the uncertainty in energy is less than ΔE, so that the two states are resolvable. Because if the uncertainty in energy is smaller than the energy difference, then we can distinguish them.

Right, so for two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference (ΔE) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy (ΔE_uncert). And the uncertainty in energy comes from the time uncertainty via the uncertainty principle.

So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE_uncert is approximately ħ / Δt, where Δt is the time over which the energy is measured or the lifetime of the state.

Wait, but each state has a different lifetime. But the problem states that we want to distinguish both states, so perhaps we consider the minimum lifetime of the two? Or perhaps we take the average or something else. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the time uncertainty Δt for the energy measurement would be the time over which the system is observed. But in the case of two states, each with their own lifetimes, perhaps the time of observation should be longer than the longer lifetime to allow for sufficient measurement. Or maybe the time is determined by the system's own lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps the time uncertainty is the average of the two lifetimes. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of each state individually. Let's tackle this step by step.

For each energy level, the time uncertainty is its own lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime is τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. The uncertainty in energy for E1 is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1.

Similarly, for E2, τ2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

But wait, when you have two states, the energy difference between them is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each state's uncertainty adds to the overall uncertainty.

Wait, no, perhaps the overall uncertainty in the energy measurement is the maximum of the two uncertainties, or maybe the sum. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the formula.

The uncertainty principle says that the product of energy uncertainty (ΔE) and time uncertainty (Δt) is on the order of ħ. So, if you have a time measurement Δt, you can have an energy resolution of about ħ/Δt.

In this problem, the time over which we can measure the energy is probably the longer of the two lifetimes. Because if the state has a longer lifetime, you can observe it longer, giving a smaller uncertainty in energy.

Wait, no. Because if the state has a longer lifetime (like τ2=1e-8 s), the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be smaller because ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So a longer τ implies a smaller ΔE.

But in our case, to distinguish the two energies, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state's energy. Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but perhaps the relevant time is the minimum of the lifetimes? No, that would give a larger ΔE, which might be overkill. Or maybe the time we can observe is the minimum of the two lifetimes, because once one of them decays, you can't tell anymore. Hmm, that's a possibility.

Wait, but the question says "their lifetime" as if each state has its own lifetime. So perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is ħ divided by their own lifetimes. But when considering the energy difference between the two, perhaps the overall uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if you have two measurements, each with their own uncertainty, the total uncertainty in their difference would be the square root of the sum of the squares of each uncertainty. But assuming that the uncertainties are independent, the maximum uncertainty could be their sum, but maybe I should use the root-sum-squares method.

Wait, the formula for uncertainty in a difference of two measured quantities is sqrt( (ΔA)^2 + (ΔB)^2 ). So in this case, if E1 and E2 are each measured with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²).

So, to distinguish E2 and E1, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than this combined uncertainty.

So, let me write that down:

ΔE > sqrt( (ħ/τ1)^2 + (ħ/τ2)^2 )

Let me compute that.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Compute ħ/τ1: ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s.

So ħ/τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.

Similarly, ħ/τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Now, square both:

(1.05e-25)^2 = (1.1e-50) (approx)

(1.05e-26)^2 = (1.1e-52)

Sum is approximately 1.1e-50 + 1.1e-52 ≈ 1.11e-50.

Take the square root: sqrt(1.11e-50) ≈ 1.05e-25 J.

But wait, that's the same as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ1, because τ2 is ten times larger than τ1. So τ2 is bigger, so ħ/τ2 is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.05e-25 squared: (1.05)^2 is approx 1.1025, so 1.1025e-50.

Similarly, 1.05e-26 squared is 1.1025e-52.

Adding together: 1.1025e-50 + 1.1025e-52 = 1.113525e-50.

Square root: sqrt(1.1135e-50) = approx 1.055e-25 J.

Wait, but this is about the same as ħ/τ1. So the combined uncertainty is approximately 1.05e-25 J.

Wait, but what's ħ in eV·s? Because the answer options are given in eV.

Oh right, I should convert the energy from joules to electron volts. Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, 1.05e-25 J is how many eV?

Compute 1.05e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.05 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ 0.655e-6 eV ≈ 6.55e-7 eV.

So the combined uncertainty in the energy difference is about 6.55e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be larger than this to be distinguishable.

So options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than 6.55e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 6.55e-7. So yes, it's larger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is about 1e-8. Let's see: 6.55e-7 is 6.55 ×1e-7. 1e-8 is smaller. So 1e-8 is smaller than 6.55e-7.

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the combined uncertainty was sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), which was approximately 1.05e-25 J, which is about 6.55e-7 eV. So the energy difference ΔE must be bigger than this to be resolvable.

Looking at options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 6.55e-7 eV. So that would work.

Options D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's smaller than 6.55e-7 eV (which is 0.000000655 eV), so 1e-8 is smaller. So option D's ΔE is smaller than the uncertainty, so it can't be distinguished.

Wait, but wait another thing: Let me think about the exact calculation.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1=1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.60217663e-19 J, so:

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.60217663e-19 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.60217663) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6582 * 1e-6 eV = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05457e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J.

In eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.60217e-19 ≈ (1.05457 / 1.60217) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.6582e-7 eV = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 = 6.582e-7 eV and ΔE2 = 6.582e-8 eV.

The combined uncertainty in ΔE (E2 - E1) is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) = sqrt( (6.582e-7)^2 + (6.582e-8)^2 )

Calculate each term:

(6.582e-7)^2 = (6.582)^2 * 1e-14 ≈ 43.3e-14 = 4.33e-13.

(6.582e-8)^2 = (6.582)^2 * 1e-16 ≈ 43.3e-16 = 4.33e-15.

Adding them: 4.33e-13 + 4.33e-15 = approx 4.33e-13 + 0.0433e-13 = 4.3733e-13.

Square root: sqrt(4.3733e-13) ≈ 6.615e-7 eV.

So the combined uncertainty is about 6.615e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 6.6e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, much larger than 6.6e-7 eV (which is 0.00000066 eV). So option C would definitely be distinguishable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, smaller than 6.6e-7, so it wouldn't be distinguishable.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (related to the lifetime of the states), and \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the combined uncertainty in energy.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainty in energy for each state is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert these to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60217663 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Combine the uncertainties
The combined uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{combined}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substitute \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\Delta E_{\text{combined}} = \sqrt{(6.582 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.582 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
(6.582 \times 10^{-7})^2 = 4.33 \times 10^{-13}, \quad (6.582 \times 10^{-8})^2 = 4.33 \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Add them:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{combined}}^2 = 4.33 \times 10^{-13} + 4.33 \times 10^{-15} = 4.3733 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Take the square root:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{combined}} \approx \sqrt{4.3733 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.615 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{combined}} \approx 6.615 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} < 6.615 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} < 6.615 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is also too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} > 6.615 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} < 6.615 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is too small.

### Final Answer:
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure distinguishability.
