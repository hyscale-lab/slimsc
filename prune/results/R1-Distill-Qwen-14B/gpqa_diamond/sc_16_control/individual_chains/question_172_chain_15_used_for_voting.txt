Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I guess I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right? Because in LTE, the distribution follows this.

So in this case, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as j. So, n_i for star_1 is 2 * n_i for star_2. Wait, no, the question says for the same energy levels in each star. So maybe the ratio is n1_i / n2_i = 2.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, the population in the higher energy level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n1_i / n1_j = (n2_i)/(n2_j) * 2. But I'm not sure, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, no, the two stars are being compared. So, the ratio of the populations (excited atoms) for star_1 is twice that of star_2 in the same energy level. So, (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j). Or maybe I should think about the ratio of excitation in each star.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) in each star is given. Let me clarify. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. So, perhaps for each star, the population of that excited level is measured, and star_1's is twice star_2's. But wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars, because it's the same energy levels being considered.

So, for each star, the excitation in a particular energy level is governed by the Boltzmann factor. The formula would be: (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the populations in the same energy level, but between the two stars. So, in star_1, the number of excited atoms is 2 times that of star_2. So, n1_i / n2_i = 2. But wait, n_i is the number of atoms in that energy level. So, how does the temperature affect this?

Wait, no, wait. Each star has its own temperature. So for star 1, the population ratio is (n1_i)/(n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's (n2_i)/(n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But the question isn't giving the ratio of (n_i)/(n_j) for each star, but rather the population of the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait a minute, perhaps it's the ratio of the number of excited atoms in the same energy level between the two stars. So, n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But how does that relate to temperatures? Let's think. The ratio of the number of atoms in state i to the number in state j for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1: (n1_i)/(n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star 2: (n2_i)/(n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But wait, in the problem statement, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is different for each star, and the ratio between the two stars' (n_i) is 2. So, (n1_i)/(n2_i) = 2.

Wait, perhaps I should model this properly. Let me denote:

For star 1: n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), equation (1)
For star 2: n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), equation (2)

The problem states that n1_i = 2 * n2_i. So, equation (3): n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But also, the photosphere is in LTE, which implies that the excitation is determined by the temperature. So, each star's ratio is determined by its temperature.

Wait, but I'm not given the ratio of n1_j to n2_j. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) for star 1 is twice that of star 2's (n_i)/(n_j). Let me see.

Wait, no. The problem states that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, for the same energy level i, n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But each star's (n_i)/(n_j) is given by their respective Boltzmann factors. So, from equation (1), n1_i = n1_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, n2_i = n2_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But without knowing the ratio of n1_j to n2_j, I can't directly find the relation between T1 and T2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the number of atoms in the lower state is the same for both stars? No, that's not necessarily true because each star has a different number of atoms and possibly different densities. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the ratio of the populations within each star is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (assuming j is ground state) is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, for star 1, (n1_i)/(n1_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2, (n2_i)/(n2_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem says that n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

So, substituting:

n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But from the Boltzmann factors,

n1_i = n1_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)),
n2_i = n2_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So,

n1_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * n2_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But without knowing n1_j and n2_j, it's hard to proceed. However, perhaps in LTE, the total number of atoms in all energy levels is the same for each star. But that might not help unless we know the relative populations.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations in the same energy level is the same as the ratio of the Boltzmann factors. Like, (n1_i)/(n2_i) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp(ΔE/(k)(1/T1 - 1/T2)).

Wait, let's see: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ).

So, (n1_i)/(n2_i) = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ).

But we know that (n1_i)/(n2_i) = 2.

So,

2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Rearranging,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Hmm, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE / k ) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But wait, the question asks for an equation involving ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2.

Looking at the options,

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but that doesn't include ΔE or k. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, in the equation I derived, ln(2) = [ (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

But the given options don't have ΔE or k. Which makes me think that perhaps I should consider another approach. Maybe the ratio is (n1_i)/(n2_i) = 2, but perhaps the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) for each star, and in star_1, that ratio is higher than in star_2. So, I can write:

(n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j )

Wait no, that's not right. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the question says that star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So, for the same energy level i, n1_i = 2 n2_i.

But each star's n_i and n_j are related by their respective temperatures.

So,

n1_i = n1_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_i = n2_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that n1_i = 2 n2_i,

n1_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * n2_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But I don't know the ratio of n1_j to n2_j. So I'm stuck unless I make an assumption. Maybe the number of atoms in the lower state (j) is the same for both stars? That seems unlikely because the stars have different temperatures and thus different populations.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n1_j / n2_j is the same as the ratio of their total populations, but that's not necessarily the case unless the same amount of iron is present, which I don't think is given.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the ratio of the excitation probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the Boltzmann factors is the same as the ratio of the populations.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the ratio of the populations in the same energy level in each star is determined by their respective temperatures.

So,

n1_i / n2_i = 2

But,

n1_i / n2_i = [ (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] * (n1_j / n2_j )

Wait, that comes from:

n1_i = n1_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
n2_i = n2_j * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So,

(n1_i)/(n2_i) = (n1_j / n2_j) * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But unless I know (n1_j / n2_j), I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps in each star, the majority of iron atoms are in the lower state j. So, the number of atoms in state j is much larger than in state i. But assuming that the total number of iron atoms in each star is the same? Not necessarily, because the stars could have different luminosities or sizes, but that's an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the ratio of the excitation in the same energy level between the two stars. So, the number in state i relative to j for each star.

Wait, another approach. Let me take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors.

(n1_i/n1_j) / (n2_i/n2_j) ) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But (n1_i/n2_i) = 2 (n1_j/n2_j) )

Wait, no, because (n1_i/n2_i) = 2, and (n1_j/n2_j) is something else.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to express T1 in terms of T2.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation for each star,

n1_i = n1_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_i = n2_j * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But without knowing n1_j and n2_j, maybe I can take the ratio of equations:

n1_i / n2_i = [ (n1_j / n2_j) ) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is,

n1_i / n2_i = (n1_j / n2_j) * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But since n1_i = 2 n2_i,

2 = (n1_j / n2_j) * exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But without knowing (n1_j / n2_j), I can't proceed. So perhaps another assumption must be made. For instance, perhaps the ratio (n1_j / n2_j) is the same as (n1_i / n2_i) from the ground state? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excited atoms is the same as the ratio of the ground state atoms? That would be if all atoms are either in i or j, but that's a big assumption.

If I assume that n1_j = n2_j * (n1_i / n2_i), which would be a big assumption, but let me try.

Wait, that may not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n1_j / n2_j) is the same as (n1_i / n2_i).

But I think I'm stuck on this approach. Maybe I should think about the ratio of the two excitation probabilities.

Wait, another angle: The probability that an atom is in the excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1, the probability is P1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, P2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem says that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. So, P1 = 2 P2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1. So perhaps the ratio of the number of excited atoms is 2:1, so n1_i = 2 n2_i. But if the total number of atoms is the same, then P1 = 2 P2. But the total number of atoms in each star's photosphere could be different, so this approach may not hold.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the probabilities is 2. So,

P1 / P2 = 2.

Which is,

[exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = 2

Which simplifies to,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )) = 2

Take ln both sides,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Which is,

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the given energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute k. Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same value as ΔE.

So, ΔE = k_B * T where T is some value. But in this case, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B (since k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k_B.

So,

ln(2) = [ (k_B) * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

But since ΔE = k_B,

ln(2) = (k_B (T1 - T2)) / (T1 T2 k_B ) )

Simplifying,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which rearranges to,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of atoms in different energy states to temperature. The Boltzmann factor is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the states, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \(n_{1i} = 2 n_{2i}\). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations for each star is:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two equations:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}/n_{1j}}{n_{2i}/n_{2j}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(n_{1i} = 2 n_{2i}\), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = k_B\) (where \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship.
