Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think it through. 

The question is about a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to focus on that. The Lagrangian might tell me what particles X can decay into because it shows what interactions are possible. The term is something like -λf f_bar ψ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the fermions involved are the ones that X can interact with, which would determine possible decay channels.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find which of the given options correctly lists the possible decay products. The options involve different pairs of fermions, like b quarks, s quarks, etc., and maybe leptons like e, mu, tau.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of particles, the sum of the particles' rest masses must be less than the boson's mass. So, each possible decay product pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Let's think about the fermions and their masses. I'll list out the approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV (negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar, around 5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Tau lepton (τ): around 1.777 GeV
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV
- Electron (e): negligible mass, ~0.0005 GeV

So, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs as long as 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible pair:

1. b b-bar: Each b is 4.5 GeV. So 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV. Oh wait, that's 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So b can't be a decay product. So any option with b b-bar is wrong. Looking at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar. The mass would be 9 GeV, which is too big. So A is not possible. Similarly, looking at the other options.

Option D includes b b-bar, so D would also be incorrect. Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. Wait, 4.5*2 is 9, which is bigger than 6. So X can't decay into b quarks. So any option with b in the decay products is out.

So, options A and D are out because they include b b-bar.

Options B and C are the remaining ones.

Now, looking at the other quarks:

s s-bar: each s is ~100 MeV, so 200 MeV total. That's much less than 6 GeV. So s s-bar is allowed.

u u-bar: u is 2 MeV, so 4 MeV. Allowed.

d d-bar: similar to u, so allowed.

c c-bar: each c is about 1.5 GeV. 3 GeV in total. That's under 6 GeV. So c c-bar is allowed.

Now, what about the leptons:

tau+ tau-: each tau is ~1.777 GeV. So 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.55 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

mu+ mu-: each mu is 0.1 GeV. So 0.2 GeV. Allowed.

e+ e-: negligible mass, so allowed.

What about top quarks? t and t-bar each are 173 GeV. 2*173 is way beyond 6 GeV. So t can't be part of any decay. So any option with t t-bar is wrong.

Looking at the options, option C includes t t-bar. So C is incorrect because top quarks are too heavy.

So that leaves us with option B and another? Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones except the b quark.

Wait, but option B also includes tau, which we determined is allowed. Because tau's combined mass is ~3.5 GeV, which is under 6 GeV.

So, the allowed decay channels are all pairs where 2m_f < 6 GeV. Let me list all possible:

Quarks:
- u and d: yes, because their masses are small.
- s: yes, 100 MeV each.
- c: 1.5 GeV each. 3 GeV total. So yes.
- b: 4.5 GeV each, 9 GeV. No.
- t: way too big.

Leptons:
- e: yes.
- mu: yes.
- tau: yes.

So the possible decay products are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, option B lists exactly these: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but I thought some options might have more. Let me check the options again.

Option B: X → c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones.

So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provides information about the fermions \( X \) can interact with, but the key factor is the mass of \( X \), which dictates which fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the combined rest mass of the fermion pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The approximate masses of the fermions are:
- \( u \): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (negligible)

### Step 2: Determine allowed decays
- **\( b \bar{b} \):** \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed.
- **\( s \bar{s} \):** \( 2m_s = 200 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( u \bar{u} \):** \( 2m_u = 4 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( d \bar{d} \):** \( 2m_d = 10 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( c \bar{c} \):** \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( \tau^+ \tau^- \):** \( 2m_\tau = 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( \mu^+ \mu^- \):** \( 2m_\mu = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( e^+ e^- \):** \( 2m_e \approx 0 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
- **\( t \bar{t} \):** \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which far exceeds \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect.**
- **Option B:** Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct.**
- **Option C:** Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect.**

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
