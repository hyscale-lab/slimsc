Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They provided the components of the operator P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for a component of angular momentum (like L, S, etc.) is given by ħ times a Pauli matrix multiplied by the component (x, y, z). But wait, the problem here is about the operator P, which might be similar to the spin operator S. Since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, I'm thinking P could be the spin-1/2 operator, because the possible eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

So, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be represented as (x, 0, z), but more generally, any vector in the x-z plane. The unit vector n can be written in terms of spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0 (since it's in x-z plane), x would be sinθ, and z would be cosθ.

The operator P along n would be the dot product of n and the vector operator P. So, P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Wait, no, the operator for the component along n is P = n · P, where P is the vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, P becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting in the given components:

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, because n is a unit vector. So,

P = sinθ (P_x) + cosθ (P_z).

We can write P as:
P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * matrix for P_x + cosθ * matrix for P_z ]

Let me write out each matrix. 

The P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

sinθ * P_x is (since it's multiplied by ħ/2):
(ħ/2) * [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ]

Similarly, cosθ * P_z is (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these together:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait, no. Because P_x is multiplied by sinθ, and P_z by cosθ. But wait, each component is already multiplied by ħ/2. So, when adding, I think it's:

[ [ ħ/2 * 0 * sinθ + ħ/2 * 1 * cosθ, ... ] ]

Wait, perhaps I should factor out the ħ/2. Let me see.

Each component's matrix is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective matrix. So, P_x is (ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when we take sinθ * P_x, it's sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], and cosθ * P_z is cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when we add them, it's:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no: Let me compute each element.

The (1,1) element: (sinθ)*(P_x's element (1,1) is 0) + (cosθ)*(P_z's element (1,1) is 1) → 0 + cosθ * 1 → cosθ. Multiply by ħ/2 → (ħ/2) cosθ.

Similarly, (1,2) element: (sinθ)*(1) + (cosθ)*(0) → sinθ. Multiply by ħ/2 → (ħ/2) sinθ.

(2,1) element is same as (1,2), so (ħ/2) sinθ.

(2,2) element: (sinθ)*(0) from P_x + (cosθ)*(-1) → -cosθ. Multiply by ħ/2 → (ħ/2)(-cosθ).

So the matrix for operator P is (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So, [ (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] ] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides and get:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

| [cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

Which means that the matrix [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] has an eigenvalue of 1, and |ψ> is the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. The matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let's compute its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy:

det( [ [ cosθ - λ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ - λ ] ] ) = 0

So, determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0.

Expanding:

( -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ² ) - sin²θ = 0.

Wait, wait,

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = (-cosθ)(cosθ) - cosθ λ + (-λ)(-cosθ) + (-λ)(-λ)
= -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ²
= -cos²θ + λ².

So, determinant is (-cos²θ + λ²) - sin²θ = 0.

So:

λ² - cos²θ - sin²θ = 0 → λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 0 → λ² - 1 = 0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

Since we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which when scaled by (ħ/2) gives the eigenvalue of 1, so our matrix has eigenvalue 1.

So, the eigenvector equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

We can write it as:

( cosθ - 1 ) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0

sinθ ψ₁ + ( -cosθ -1 ) ψ₂ = 0

Wait, let me write the equations. Let me denote ψ₁ and ψ₂ as the components of the eigenvector.

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0

Equation 2: sinθ ψ₁ + (-cosθ -1) ψ₂ = 0

We can take Equation 1 to express ψ₂ in terms of ψ₁:

ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ₁.

But wait, this is under the assumption that sinθ is not zero. If sinθ is zero, then θ is 0 or π, but let's proceed under the assumption that sinθ ≠ 0.

So, ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ₁.

We can simplify (1 - cosθ)/sinθ. I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So, ψ₂ = tan(θ/2) ψ₁.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [1, tan(θ/2)] or any scalar multiple. To find the normalized eigenvector, we can take this ratio and normalize.

Let me write the vector as:

|ψ> = [ ψ₁, ψ₂ ] = [ 1, tan(θ/2) ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² = 1.

Since ψ₁ = 1, ψ₂ = tan(θ/2), the normalization factor squared is:

(1)^2 + (tan(θ/2))^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2).

So, the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(sec²(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2).

Wait, 1 / sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(sec²(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

ψ₁ = cos(θ/2) * (1) → cos(θ/2)

ψ₂ = cos(θ/2) * tan(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) ] = sin(θ/2)

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking back, the eigenvector is [1, tan(theta/2)], and after normalization, it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, if the vector is [1, tan(theta/2)], then the norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(theta/2)]^2 = 1 + tan²(theta/2) = sec²(theta/2), so the norm is sec(theta/2). Hence, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), because:

[1 / sec(theta/2), tan(theta/2) / sec(theta/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of x, y, z components, but the direction is in x-z plane. So that's why the eigenvector ends up being in terms of theta/2, which is typical for spin-1/2 systems.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. But wait, the options might include more factors. Let's check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

Wait, in my calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but in the problem statement, the operator includes P_y which has imaginary components. So, perhaps the eigenvector could have phase factors or other terms?

Wait, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi =0 because the direction is along a vector that has no y-component. So, phi=0, making the eigenvector real.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The eigenvectors for spin-1/2 in a direction (theta, phi) are generally given by:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

|-> = [ -e^{-i phi} sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]

So, in our case, phi is zero because the direction n is in the x-z plane (phi=0). So, the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But let me check the options again. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't factor in the theta/2, so that's probably for a different context, maybe higher spin or something else.

Option C is exactly what I have, so I think the answer is option C.

Wait, but the problem says that the operator is P, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which aligns with the positive spin along direction n.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

Let me check the other options.

Option A: [sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ ] → but why would the eigenvector have ħ in it? That doesn't make sense because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector.

So, probably option A is incorrect. Similarly, option D has ħ terms, which is odd for a normalized eigenvector.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which again doesn't have the theta/2, so probably not the correct one.

So the correct answer must be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, we have:

\[
\vec{P} = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, this becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle
\]

Factoring out $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$ are $\pm 1$. Since we are looking for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we focus on the eigenvalue $+1$. The corresponding eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = 0
\]

This leads to the equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)\psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0$  
2. $\sin\theta \psi_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)\psi_2 = 0$

From the first equation, we solve for $\psi_2$ in terms of $\psi_1$:

\[
\psi_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \psi_1
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
\psi_2 = \tan(\theta/2) \psi_1
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \psi_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

To normalize, we impose the condition $|\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2 = 1$. Substituting $\psi_2 = \tan(\theta/2)\psi_1$, we find:

\[
|\psi_1|^2 \left(1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)\right) = 1
\]

Using $1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2)$, we get:

\[
|\psi_1| = \cos(\theta/2), \quad |\psi_2| = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This includes $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent for a normalized eigenvector.  
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — This does not account for the $\theta/2$ dependence, which is critical for spin-1/2 systems.  
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.  
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — This introduces unnecessary coefficients and is inconsistent with the normalization.

The correct answer is therefore **Option C**.
