Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. Their orbits are circular.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in a spectral line. Planet #2's host star had a shift of 7 milliangstrom. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I think I need is the one relating the RV semi-amplitude (K) to other orbital parameters.

The formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) * ( (1/( (1 AU) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. I think the precise formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/ ) ) Hmm, no, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, but I think it's something like K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps a better way to think about this. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the RV method depends on the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis). Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun (M_*) and the planets have similar masses (M_p), and the period is what we're trying to find, perhaps we can relate the velocities.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3))

But since the planets are in circular orbits (e=0), and the planet masses are much smaller than the stars (assuming M_p << M_*), the equation simplifies. Let's make that assumption.

So, M_* is the mass of the star, M_p is the planet's mass. Since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, M_p / M_* is small, so terms like (M_p / M_*) can be considered as a small factor.

Wait, but in the formula for K, the semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ ) * ( (1) / ( ( (1 + M_p/(M_*)) )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( P^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should write the correct formula. I think the correct expression is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. The RV method measures the velocity of the star in its orbit. The star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) )) )

But wait, maybe a better approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )

Wait, I'm not getting it right. Let me try to recall the exact formula. Oh right, the standard formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / (c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P)^(1/3) ) )

But again, since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies.

Let me consult my notes. Oh wait, I don't have notes. Let me think about the relation between K and P.

I recall that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, all else being equal. So if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Suppose for two planets, planet 1 and planet 2, with K1 and K2 as their semi-amplitudes, and P1 and P2 their periods. If M_p1 = M_p2 (as in this case, both masses similar to Neptune), and M_*1 = M_*2 (same as Sun), then:

K1 / K2 = ( ( P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

The formula for K (semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (c * P ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately:

The formula is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( c / (2 pi) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (G * M_p)^(1/3) * (1 / M_*^(1/3)) ) * ( (2 pi ) / (c * P ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me write the formula correctly. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / ( c * P^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the star's velocity.

The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbital speed. The star's velocity (v) is (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) times the planet's orbital speed (v_p). But since M_p << M_*, v ≈ (M_p / M_*) * v_p.

The planet's orbital speed v_p is given by v_p = 2π a / P, where a is the semi-major axis.

But also from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) a^3. For M_* >> M_p, this simplifies to P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_*)) a³.

So combining these two: v_p = 2π a / P = (2π / P) * a = (2π / P) * ( ( G M_* P²/(4 π²) )^(1/3) )

Wait, let me substitute a from Kepler's law.

a³ = G M_* P² / (4 π² )

So a = [ G M_* P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So v_p = 2 π a / P = 2 π [ ( G M_* P² )/(4 π² ) ) ]^(1/3) / P

Simplify:

v_p = (2 π) / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * [ G M_* P² ]^(1/3) ) / ( P )

Let me compute the exponents.

2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3) = 2 π / ( (4)^(1/3) * (π²)^(1/3) )) ) = 2 π / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )) )

= 2 π^(1 - 2/3) ) / 4^(1/3) )

= 2 π^(1/3) / 4^(1/3) )

But 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3), so:

= 2 * (2^(-2/3)) * π^(1/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) * π^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) )

So v_p = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) * [ G M_* P² ]^(1/3) ) / ( P )

Which is:

v_p = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) * ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / ( P )

= 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

So, v_p = ( 2 π G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Now, the star's velocity v = (M_p / M_*) v_p ≈ (M_p / M_*) * ( 2 π G M_* )^(1/3) P^(-1/3 )

Because M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So,

v = K ≈ ( M_p / M_* ) * ( 2 π G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Simplify:

K = ( M_p ) * ( 2 π G )^(1/3) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, because:

(M_p / M_*) ) * ( M_*^(1/3) ) = M_p * M_*^(-2/3 )

Wait, let me re-do the exponents. Let's see:

(2 π G M_* )^(1/3) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_*^(1/3 )

So,

v ≈ ( M_p / M_* ) * (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_*^(1/3) ) * P^(-1/3 )

= M_p * (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_*^(-2/3) ) * P^(-1/3 )

So, K = v ≈ ( M_p (2 π G )^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * P^(-1/3 )

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) * P^(-1/3 )

But since M_p is the same for both planets (given as similar to Neptune), then K1 / K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(-1/3 )

Wait, because K is proportional to P^(-1/3). So if K1 is 5 milli and K2 is7 milli, then K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(-1/3 )

Wait, no, wait another moment. Let me think again.

If K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) ), then K1 = (constant) * (1/P1^(1/3) ), and K2 = (same constant) * (1/P2^(1/3) )

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Ah, so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me see: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3 )

Then, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So,

5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, wait. Wait, no, I think I messed that up.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So,

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, no, wait, from K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

=> P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, P2 is shorter than P1, so the ratio is less than 1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, then P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait. Wait no, the way the question is phrased: "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 36% as long as P1. So, the period of #2 is shorter than #1. But the question is asking by how much longer is #2's period than #1's. So the answer would be less than 1 times. So the ratio is P2/P1 ≈ 0.36.

But wait, in the calculation earlier, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer. So how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's? It's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36 times.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to be sure.

We started with K = (M_p (2 π G )^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * P^(-1/3 )

Since M_p and M_* are same for both, K is proportional to P^(-1/3 )

K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K1/K2 = (5/7) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Which is approximately (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 * P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Now, the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? Since it's shorter, the factor is 0.36 times. So the period is about 0.36 times as long, which is ~36% of planet #1's period. So the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( P^{-1/3} \), assuming the planet-to-star mass ratio is constant and the orbits are circular. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K_1 / K_2 = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( P_2 / P_1 \):

\[
\left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \), as planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.
