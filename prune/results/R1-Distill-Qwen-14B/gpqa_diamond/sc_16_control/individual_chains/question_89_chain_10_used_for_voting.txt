Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). There's also a characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to get product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative with bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3. KOH is a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction is happening here. Wait, but 1,3-dibromo is a possibility for dehydrohalogenation. Since it's heated, E2 mechanism is likely. Two elimination reactions could occur.

Wait, but considering the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each carbon in a chair-like position. The 1,3-dibromide would have Br atoms in axial positions (maybe?), but I'm not too sure. When KOH is used, it would deprotonate and eliminate Br⁻.

Elimination would form a double bond. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations happen, leading to a diene. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated to form a single double bond. Wait, but product 1 is a solid, and the NMR suggests some kind of ketone because of the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group.

Wait, wait. If two elimination reactions happen, but perhaps they are dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone is formed. Hmm, could this be an example of the Hofmann elimination? Or perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to a conjugated diene? No, wait, the IR suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a base, could undergo two E2 eliminations, each removing a Br and a proton, forming a double bond. But if that's the case, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C, which would be around 1600 cm⁻¹. Instead, the 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But KOH is a base, and for substitution, it would be more of an SN2, but with a bulky molecule like adamantane, SN2 is unlikely. So probably elimination.

Wait, another possibility: it's a double elimination, but the product is a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't support that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must be a ketone.

So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH? Maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would give a diol. But then, under certain conditions, could the diol undergo oxidation to form a ketone? Wait, but the reaction conditions are KOH and heat. That's more like elimination, not oxidation.

Wait, perhaps elimination of HBr from each Br, forming a double bond, but in such a way that the structure becomes a cyclohexane ring with a ketone. No, that seems confusing.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Singlet suggests no neighboring Hs. Maybe these are OCH2 groups, but wait, if it's a ketone, OCH2 would not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantanediol, but that would be a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches, which would be around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. The IR here shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1-adamantanol? No, that's a secondary alcohol. But the IR doesn't show the O-H stretch. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs that are in positions that could be converted into ketones? How?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group. Wait, but under basic conditions, maybe the Br is replaced by an alkoxide, but that doesn't directly form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where KOH substitutes Br with hydroxide, but then what? Maybe dehydration occurs to form a ketone. Wait, but two hydroxyl groups from 1,3-diol would need to lose water to form a double bond, but that would give an alkene, not a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene group next to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. So maybe it's an OCH2 group. But if it's a ketone, OCH2 doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's an epoxide. No, epoxides tend to have protons around 3-4 ppm and coupling between the two Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is a carbonyl group, but that would be a carbon, not a proton. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diol which then undergoes some kind of cyclization to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a diene, but then in the presence of KOH, perhaps allylic oxidation occurs. But I don't think KOH would cause that without an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't show the ether's C-O stretch around 1050-1250 cm⁻¹. The IR here is 1720, which is more likely a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diol but a ketone. Let's think about how that could happen. Maybe each Br is replaced by an alcohol group, which then loses water to form a ketone. But that would require each Br to be in a position where substitution and elimination can form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that eliminating two HBr molecules forms a conjugated diene. But then, how does that produce a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, and then the diol undergoes oxidation to form a diketone. But under KOH and heat, without an oxidizing agent, oxidation is unlikely. Wait, unless the diol can eliminate water to form a ketone. But for that, the diol would need to be vicinal (next to each other), which 1,3-diol isn't.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diol, and then another reaction occurs, but the problem states that product 1 is formed after heating with KOH. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Another approach: the IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Let's think about how heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH can form a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination where two HBr are lost and a carbonyl is formed. Like in the formation of a ketone via dehydrohalogenation twice.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is such that when the two Br atoms are removed, a conjugated diene is formed with a ring that allows for some kind of cyclization or oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, leading to a ketone. Wait, if each Br is replaced by an O-, but that would require two deprotonations, but KOH is a strong base. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, but with the structure of adamantane, perhaps this leads to a bridgehead double bond. But adamantane is known to have high bridgehead strain, so maybe that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait a minute, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible structure of product 1. The NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That often suggests a methylene group (CH₂) that's in a symmetric environment, like attached to an electronegative atom or in a bridge structure.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group (OH), forming 1,3-diol. But under basic conditions, maybe the diol loses water to form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-diol can't form a ketone by dehydration because the OHs are on non-adjacent carbons.

Wait, unless the diol is a cyclic structure. Maybe during the reaction, the 1,3-diol cyclizes to form a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure how that would work structurally.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diol, but instead each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group that then participates in an elimination to form a carbonyl group. So each Br is replaced by an OH, and then each OH loses a proton to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but to form a ketone from an alcohol usually requires oxidation, which KOH doesn't provide. Unless there's some kind of elimination reaction where the two OH groups lose water and form a ketone. But again, if they're on 1 and 3 positions, that might not form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms undergo elimination to form a conjugated diene, but then the diene isn't showing in the IR. Or maybe the diene is further reacting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for another angle. After the reaction, product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, the initial reaction must have transformed the dibromide into a ketone. How?

Ah! Maybe it's a case of double elimination with loss of HBr from each bromine, leading to the formation of two double bonds. Wait, but that might form a diene, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each elimination forms a ketone. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless there's some ring formation.

Wait, maybe the reaction is similar to the formation of cyclohexanone from 1,3-dibromocyclohexane via double elimination. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like the formation of a carbonyl through a different mechanism. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and formation of a carbonyl group. But for each Br, that would require two eliminations, leading to two carbonyls. But that would form a diketone.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on adjacent carbons in such a way that eliminating two HBr would form a conjugated diene, but perhaps the structure of adamantane allows for a ring formation upon dehydrohalogenation, leading to a bridged ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, elimination could form a carbonyl.

Wait, aha! Maybe each elimination is a Hofmann-type elimination, which forms the less substituted alkene. But I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the structure of the product 1. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H). Singlet means no neighboring Hs. So perhaps those two Hs are on a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen. So maybe OCH2.

Wait, but OCH2 is more likely to be around 3.5-4.5 ppm. 4.79 is a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to CH2. But that wouldn't give a singlet for the CH2.

Wait, another thought: the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a cyclic ether or epoxide. But in that case, it usually shows up around 3-4 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone and an adjacent CH2 group. For example, if the structure is something like (CH2)2CO. But in adamantane, the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet at 4.79 is due to a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, like a ketone. For example, in acetone, the CH3 groups are around 2.1 ppm, but perhaps in a more substituted environment, the shift is higher.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone. For example, two ketone groups in the structure.

But then, how? Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 (2H) could be a bridgehead CH2 group adjacent to a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone, such as 1,3-adamantanedione.

But I'm not certain about the exact structure. Let's move forward and see if the next steps can help.

Next, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might be an acylated product. For example, Friedel-Crafts acylation could add an acyl group to an aromatic ring, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that usually requires a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a dienone (a conjugated diene with a ketone group), then heating with Al isopropoxide could induce some kind of cyclization or dimerization. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a result of some kind of alkylation. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But perhaps product 2 is an epoxide. Wait, how? If product 1 is a diol, then reacting with Al isopropoxide could form an epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is the result of a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the next step. Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, followed by dimethyl sulfide.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. The reaction conditions (ozone at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide) suggest that they are performing ozonolysis with reductive workup, but dimethyl sulfide is a reductive workup agent, which typically leads to aldehydes and ketones instead of breaking into smaller fragments.

Wait, let me think. Ozonolysis of a double bond generally cleaves it. If the double bond is in a ring, the ring would open. The product would depend on the structure of product 2.

So, if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, but wait, product 2 would have a single double bond, perhaps.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about the initial steps again.

Product 1: NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 (2H), and IR shows a carbonyl. So probably a ketone with a CH2 group next to it.

Heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of enolate formation. Wait, but enolates are usually formed with strong bases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane is not aromatic, so that's unlikely. Maybe it's an acylation of an enol ether, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that's an alcohol, and the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantane-dione, with two ketone groups. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide could induce some kind of ring contraction or expansion. Hmm, but I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. Enol ethers have double bonds adjacent to oxygen. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl compounds.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the final step and see if that can help.

Product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The most deshielded proton would likely be near an electronegative group, such as a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group.

In the NMR, the deshielded protons are usually downfield. So, if there's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group, the protons on the CH2 would be deshielded.

Wait, for example, in a compound like (CH2)2CO, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet or something else.

But wait, let me think about the coupling. If a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the two protons on the CH2 would couple with each other (giving a triplet if they are split by neighboring protons), but in this case, since it's a singlet in product 1, perhaps in product 3, the environment has changed.

Wait, another thought: after ozonolysis, if the product is a diketone, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 adjacent to two carbonyl groups.

Wait, for example, if the structure is O=C-(CH2)-CH2-C=O, then the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group and another CH2 group.

Wait, let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

If a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex. Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH group, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets or something similar.

Wait, but considering a simple structure where a CH2 is next to a carbonyl group (like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R'), the CH2 protons would couple with each other and perhaps with neighboring groups.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group, the protons on the middle CH2 would have coupling with both adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CO

In this case, the middle CH2 would have protons that are split by the neighboring CH2 groups on both sides. Each of the two protons on the middle CH2 would couple with the two protons on each adjacent CH2. So each would have coupling constants J1 and J2, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, but that might be getting too detailed. Let me think about the options given.

The options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group which is adjacent to a carbonyl, then the coupling could involve two neighboring groups.

Suppose the structure is (CO)-CH2-CH2-X, where X is another group. The middle CH2 would have protons that couple with the adjacent CH2 groups on both sides.

Each proton on the middle CH2 would see two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2. So each proton would have two coupling partners, each with a different J value. That would lead to a triplet of triplets (each proton has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, leading to splitting into 3 and then 3 again, so 3x3 =9 peaks, but that's a triplet of triplets).

Alternatively, if the coupling is with two different sets, perhaps a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two different CH2 groups, each with different coupling constants, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is a methine (CH) group, but the question says it's a hydrogen atom, so probably a CH or CH2.

Wait, another approach: the initial product 1 after KOH is a ketone. Heating with Al isopropoxide might cause some kind of rearrangement or aldol addition. Suppose product 1 is a diketone, like 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide might cause the diketone to undergo a cyclization, perhaps forming a bridge.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, product 2 could be a diene, formed via elimination. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the question is about product 3, which is the ozonolysis product.

Let me think about the possible structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two aldehyde or ketone groups depending on substitution.

But given the complexity of adamantane, the actual structure is probably more complex.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an enol ether (after some kind of acylation), and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be next to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

Suppose in product 3, there's a structure like (CO)CH2CH2(CO), so the middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each adjacent to a carbonyl. The protons on the middle CH2 would couple with the neighboring CH2 groups.

Each of the two protons on the middle CH2 would have coupling with two sets of protons: one from each side.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The middle CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. The protons on this CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH2 groups on both sides. Each adjacent CH2 has two protons, so each proton on the middle CH2 would have two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, no. Each proton on the middle CH2 is adjacent to two protons on each side. So each of the middle CH2 protons would have coupling with two protons on the left and two on the right. But that's not how coupling works. Each proton can only couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, in reality, each proton on the middle CH2 would only couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group on one side and the two on the other side. But in reality, each proton can only couple with adjacent (vicinal) protons. So for each proton in the middle CH2, the adjacent protons are the two on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, no. Vicinal coupling is between protons on adjacent carbons. So for a structure like A-CH2-CH2-B, where A and B are carbonyl groups, each CH2 is connected to the next.

So, the middle CH2 (let's say CH2-X-CH2) would have each of its two protons coupling with the two protons on the left CH2 and the two on the right CH2.

But each proton on the middle CH2 is only coupled to the protons on the adjacent CH2 groups. So each proton on the middle CH2 would have two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2. So each has two coupling partners, each with two protons, but I'm not sure how that would split.

Wait, let me think about a specific scenario. Let's say you have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The middle CH2 has two protons. Each of these protons is adjacent to the two protons on the left and the two on the right. So each middle proton would be split by two neighboring groups, each with two protons.

Each coupling (J) would be between the middle proton and the adjacent CH2. So each middle proton would have coupling with two different sets: the left CH2 and the right CH2. Each coupling would cause splitting.

So for each middle proton, the splitting would be a doublet from the left CH2 and a doublet from the right CH2. The combination would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but perhaps the two adjacent CH2 groups have the same coupling constant. Then, each middle proton would couple with four equivalent protons, leading to a pentet (n+1, where n=4). But that's not matching the options either.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is more complicated. Let's think about the structure again.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 is between two CH2 groups. So the middle CH2 protons would be next to two sets of CH2 groups. Each set has two protons. So each middle proton would have two neighboring protons on each side. So each middle proton would have two J values.

So for each middle proton, the splitting would be a doublet (from the left CH2, which has two protons) and another doublet (from the right CH2, also two protons). So the overall splitting would be a doublet of doublets, which is not an option here. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the middle CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO. Then, the middle CH would have three protons (if CH), but the question refers to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is with two different groups, each contributing a triplet. For example, if each adjacent CH2 has two protons, then the middle CH2 would have each proton split by two different groups, each causing a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's think about how that works. Each proton on the middle CH2 is split by two different sets of protons, each set causing a triplet. So first, each proton is split into a triplet by the left CH2 (two protons, so n=2). Then, each of those peaks is further split by the right CH2 (another n=2), leading to a triplet of triplets. So for each of the two protons, the splitting would be 3 x 3 =9 peaks, but perhaps it's observed as a triplet of triplets.

But wait, the splitting order might not matter. Alternatively, each coupling could be a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling is with three different groups, perhaps a triplet of triplets or something else.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about the coupling in a simple structure. Let's say you have a central CH2 group, with two adjacent CH2 groups on either side. Each adjacent CH2 has two protons.

Each proton in the central CH2 would couple with the two protons on each adjacent CH2. So each proton would have two sets of two neighboring protons.

The splitting for each proton would be (n+1) for each coupling. So each coupling would be a triplet. So for two couplings, it would be a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two groups, each giving a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So the most deshielded proton would be a triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with excess KOH, the product (1) is formed, which exhibits a 1H NMR spectrum with peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H), along with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. The IR peak indicates the presence of a carbonyl group, suggesting that product 1 is likely a ketone. The singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group in a symmetric environment, possibly adjacent to a carbonyl group.

When product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, product 2 is formed. Aluminum isopropoxide often facilitates reactions such as acylation or cyclization. Given the structure of product 1 as a ketone, product 2 could involve a rearrangement or the formation of a conjugated diene.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, and the resulting product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield adjacent protons due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering the splitting patterns, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Each proton on this CH₂ group couples with the two protons on adjacent CH₂ groups, leading to a splitting pattern that is a triplet of triplets. This arises because each proton on the CH₂ group is split by two sets of neighboring protons, each set contributing a triplet splitting.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

Answer: B
