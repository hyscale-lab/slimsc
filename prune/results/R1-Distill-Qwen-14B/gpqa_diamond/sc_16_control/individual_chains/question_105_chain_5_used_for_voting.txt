Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and take notes.

The problem says we're observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, 1000 K less. So the spots are at 5000 K?

The star's brightness variations are being observed, and it's said that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. But in this case, the spots are causing the variation. The question is, what would be the radius (Rpl) of a planet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots, assuming no spots were present.

Wait, no. The question says, to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve if the star wasn't covered by spots, what should be the planet's radius relative to the star's radius. So, they need to compare the dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots.

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is what we're comparing. The dip in brightness (delta Flux) is what we're after.

First, let's understand how the spots affect the brightness. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is due to the change in the area of the star that's cooler.

Similarly, when a planet transits the star, it blocks a part of the star's disk, causing a decrease in brightness. The amount of decrease depends on the area blocked.

So, to find Rpl/Rstar, I need to model both scenarios—spotty star and planet transit—and set their flux variations equal, then solve for Rpl.

Let me think about the flux calculation.

Flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law). The effective flux is the sum over all parts of the star's surface.

In the case of the star with spots, the total flux when a hemisphere is spotted is:

Flux_total = Flux_unspotted + Flux_spots

Flux_unspotted is the flux from the unspotted part of the hemisphere. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the other is normal.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the spotted area in the hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

The unspotted area is the hemisphere minus the spots: 2πR² - 0.4π R² = 1.6π R².

So, the flux when the spots are visible (when the spotty hemisphere is facing us) is:

F_spotty = (1.6π R²) * σ Teff^4 + (0.4π R²) * σ (Teff - 1000)^4

Wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. The other hemisphere is normal.

Wait, no. The star is rotating, so the spotty hemisphere is visible for half the rotation period. Wait, no, the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. But the problem is about the brightness variation due to the spots as the star rotates.

Wait, actually, the star is emitting light from its entire surface, but the spots affect the overall brightness when they are in our line of sight.

Wait, perhaps I should model the average flux. But since the star is rotating, the observed flux depends on how much of the spotted area is visible.

Wait, perhaps the star is only showing one hemisphere at any time, so when the spotty hemisphere is rotating towards us, the spots are on the part we see. So, when the star is in a position where the spotty hemisphere is fully visible, the observed flux is lower due to the spots. As it rotates, when the unspotted hemisphere comes into view, the flux increases.

But I think for this problem, the maximum change in flux (the amplitude of the variation) is what's important. The spots cause a dip in brightness when the spotty side is facing us, and when the unspotted side is facing us, the brightness goes back up.

Wait, but in reality, the spots would be in a fixed position on the star, so as the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view. So the brightness variation is periodic, with the maximum dip when the maximum number of spots is in view.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun and that one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The unspotted area of the hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

The other hemisphere, which is entirely unspotted, has an area of 2π R².

So, when the star is such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us (i.e., the side with spots is the one we see), the total flux is:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R²) * σ T_sun^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (T_sun - 1000 K)^4

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotty = (2 π R²) * σ T_sun^4

But wait, no—because the star is a sphere, the flux we receive depends on the area of the star that's visible. Wait, no, because when we're looking at a hemisphere, it's the entire surface area of the star that's being observed, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the part of the star we can see. So the flux would be:

Flux_spotty = (Area_unspotted_in_hemisphere) * T_eff^4 + (Area_spotted_in_hemisphere) * T_spots^4

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the sum is:

F_spotty = (2π R² * (1 - 0.2) ) * Teff^4 + (2π R² * 0.2 ) * (Teff - 1000)^4

Which simplifies to:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R²) Teff^4 + (0.4 π R²) (Teff-1000)^4

And when the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotty = (2 π R²) Teff^4

Wait, no. Because the other hemisphere is not spotty, so all 2π R² is at Teff. So the difference in flux is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Wait, but wait. The star is a sphere, so when we look at the spotty hemisphere, the area we see is 2π R², of which 0.2 is spotted. So the flux is:

F_spotty = (2π R² * (1 - 0.2)) * Teff^4 + (2π R² * 0.2) * (Teff - 1000)^4 

Which is:

F_spotty = 1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² (Teff-1000)^4 

Similarly, when the other hemisphere (unspotty) is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotty = 2π R² Teff^4 

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to compute the average flux when the star is in the spotty and unspotty positions. Wait, no, I think the maximum brightness is when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum is when the spotty one is visible. So the flux variation is the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty.

But wait, actually, the star is continuously rotating, so perhaps the flux varies as the spots come into and out of view. But the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet transit, where the brightness drops when the planet is in front.

So, to compare the amplitude, we need to calculate the maximum dip in flux caused by the spots (when the spotty hemisphere is in front) and compare it to the dip caused by a planet.

Wait, but when the star is in the spotty hemisphere position, the flux is lower. So the dip is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty, which is lower. So the variation from maximum (F_unspotty) to minimum (F_spotty) would be the change in flux.

But perhaps the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_spotty, and when it's the other hemisphere (unspotty), it's F_unspotty which is higher.

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_unspotty - F_spotty).

Similarly, the amplitude caused by the planet is when the planet blocks a portion of the star's flux, so the dip would be (Flux without planet) - (Flux with planet blocking area A).

But wait, the planet transiting would cause a dip in the flux proportional to the area blocked. So the dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * Flux_total.

Wait, but when comparing the two, the dip caused by the spots is (F_unspotty - F_spotty), and the dip caused by the planet is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F_total.

Wait, no. Because the planet blocks part of the star, so the dip is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F_total.

But we're looking for the same amplitude in the light curve, meaning that the dip from the planet (delta_F_planet) equals the dip from the spots (delta_F_spots).

Wait, or maybe the other way around—since the star's flux is F_total, the spot causes a dip of F_spotty relative to F_unspotty, but I'm not quite sure how the comparison works.

Let me structure this.

First, calculate the flux variation due to spots.

F_unspotty = 2π R² * σ Teff^4 

F_spotty = (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (Teff - 1000)^4 

Wait, because the spotty hemisphere has 0.2 (20%) of its area as spots. So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² is the spotted area. The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted, which is 1.6 π R².

So,

F_spotty = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 

Similarly, the unspotty hemisphere when it's facing us gives:

F_unspotty = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 

So the change in flux (delta_F_spots) is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

delta_F_spots = [2π R² * σ (6000)^4] - [1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

Simplify:

= (2π R² σ (6000^4) ) - 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ] 

So that's the change in flux from spots.

Now, the dip caused by a planet would be when the planet blocks part of the star's disk. The dip is delta_F_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) * F_total.

Area_planet is π Rpl², and area of the star is 4π Rstar². But wait, the star's radius is Rstar = R_sun, so the area is 4π Rstar².

So,

delta_F_planet = (π Rpl² / 4π Rstar² ) * F_total 

But F_total is the star's total flux without any blocks. Wait, but when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's surface, so the observed flux is F_total * (1 - (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2)).

So the dip is F_total * (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 )

Because the planet blocks (Rpl/Rstar)^2 of the star's area. So,

delta_F_planet = F_total * (Rpl^2 / Rstar² )

We need this dip to be equal to the spot's dip: delta_F_planet = delta_F_spots.

So,

F_total * (Rpl² / Rstar² ) = 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ] 

Wait, but F_total is the star's total flux when there's no spots and no planet. F_total is 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

So,

4 π R² σ (6000^4) * (Rpl² / R² ) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, let me write F_total as 4π R² σ (6000^4 )

So,

4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) * (Rpl² / R² ) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

Simplify:

4 R² (Rpl²) (6000^4) π σ = 0.4 R² (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) π σ R² 

Wait, perhaps I should cancel out terms.

Divide both sides by π σ R²:

4 R (Rpl²) (6000^4 ) = 0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) R² 

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, left side: F_total * (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 ) = [4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) ] * [ Rpl² / R² ]

Wait, Rstar is R, so Rpl² / R². So,

Left side: 4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) * ( Rpl^2 / R^2 ) = 4 π σ R² (6000^4 ) * Rpl^2 / R² 

Which simplifies to 4 π σ (6000^4) Rpl^2

Right side: 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the delta_F_spots is 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So setting the two equal:

4 π σ (6000^4) Rpl^2 = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in substituting F_total. Because F_total is 4 π R² σ (6000^4 ), so when you multiply by (Rpl^2 / R² ), it's 4 π R² σ ... * Rpl² / R² = 4 π σ (6000^4) Rpl².

So,

4 π σ (6000^4) Rpl^2 = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, but here, the right side has R², which comes from the area of the star in the spot calculation. Wait, no, the right side is 0.4 π R² σ ( ... ), which is correct.

Wait, but in the delta_F_spots, we have:

delta_F_spots = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the equation is:

4 π σ (6000^4) Rpl² = 0.4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

We can cancel out terms: π, σ.

4 (6000^4) Rpl² = 0.4 R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Solve for Rpl².

Rpl² = [0.4 R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 (6000^4) ]

Simplify:

Rpl² = (0.4 /4 ) * (R^2) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

0.4 /4 is 0.1.

So,

Rpl² = 0.1 R² ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Take square root.

Rpl = R * sqrt( 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Compute the term inside the sqrt.

First, compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Factor out 6000^4.

= [6000^4 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ] / 6000^4 

= 1 - (5/6)^4.

Compute (5/6)^4.

5^4=625, 6^4=1296.

625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So,

Rpl² = 0.1 R² * 0.517747 

Rpl² = 0.0517747 R² 

Take sqrt:

Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.0517747) R 

sqrt(0.0517747) is approx:

0.0517747 is about 0.0518. sqrt(0.0518) is about 0.2276.

So Rpl ≈ 0.2276 R.

Wait, but this is not matching any of the options. The options are around 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, etc.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I got the relation flipped. Because the amplitude caused by the spots is when the star is in the spotty side versus the unspotty. Or maybe I should compute the spot-induced flux change as a percentage of the total flux.

Wait, perhaps I should model the spot effect as a dip in flux when the spots are visible. The dip is the difference between the unspotty flux and the spotty flux.

So,

delta_F_spots = F_unspotty - F_spotty

= (2π R² σ Teff^4) - [ (1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R² σ (Teff - deltaT)^4 ) ]

= (2π R² - 1.6 π R² ) σ Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (Teff - deltaT)^4 

= (0.4 π R² σ Teff^4 ) - 0.4 π R² σ (Teff - deltaT)^4 

= 0.4 π R² σ [ Teff^4 - (Teff - deltaT)^4 ]

So,

delta_F_spots = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The planet dip is:

delta_F_planet = (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F_total = (Rpl^2 / R^2) * (4 π R² σ Teff^4 ) 

= 4 π σ R^2 Teff^4 * (Rpl^2 / R² )

Wait, no. Wait, F_total is 4 π R² σ Teff^4, so when you block (Rpl/R)^2 of the area, the dip is:

delta_F_planet = F_total * (Rpl^2 / R^2 )

So,

delta_F_planet = 4 π R² σ Teff^4 * (Rpl^2 / R² ) = 4 π σ Teff^4 Rpl^2 

Set delta_F_planet = delta_F_spots:

4 π σ Teff^4 Rpl^2 = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, but I think I messed up in the units. Let me check:

delta_F_spots is 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

delta_F_planet is 4 π σ Teff^4 Rpl^2 

Wait, Teff is 6000 K, so Teff^4 is 6000^4.

So,

4 π σ (6000)^4 Rpl^2 = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Cancel terms:

4 (6000^4) Rpl^2 = 0.4 R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Divide both sides by 4 (6000^4 )

Rpl^2 = [0.4 R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 *6000^4 ]

= (0.4 /4 ) R² ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 )

= 0.1 R² ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 )

= 0.1 R² [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As before, (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

Rpl^2 = 0.1 R² (1 - 0.482253 ) = 0.1 R² * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747 R²

Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.0517747) R ≈ 0.2276 R

Wait, but 0.2276 R is about 0.23 R. But the options don't have that. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the area of the spots is only 20% of the hemisphere, but the hemisphere is only part of the star. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere is what we see for part of the rotation. So perhaps the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum is when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire star is emitting, but with 20% of that hemisphere being cooler.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's total flux with the spots, not considering which hemisphere is visible. Because the star is rotating, the spots are always present on one side, but as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the observed flux is a combination of the unspotted and spotty areas as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The star has a radius R. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The rest of the star is unspotted, so area is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so total surface area is 4π R². Only one hemisphere has spots, which is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.4 π R².

So, the star's surface is 4π R², with 0.4 π R² of spots (at T=5000 K) and 3.6 π R² at T=6000 K.

So the total flux of the star is:

F_total = (3.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 

Without any spots, the F_total would be 4π R² σ (6000)^4. So, the difference is the spots causing a decrease in flux.

But wait, when the spots are on the other side (not visible), the flux would be higher, as the unspotted 3.6 π R² is what's visible? No, no. The star is a sphere, so when you look at it, you see all the surface that's facing you. So if the spots are on the near side, they are part of what you see. If the star rotates, you might see the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the two scenarios again.

Scenario 1: Star with spots.

When the star is in a position where the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotty.

The variation in flux when the star rotates is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Scenario 2: Star with a planet transiting.

The planet blocks part of the star, causing a dip in flux. The dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_total.

We need to set the dip from the planet equal to the variation from the spots.

So,

(Rpl^2 / R^2 ) * F_total = F_unspotty - F_spotty

But F_total is the flux when the star is fully unspotted, which is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. The star's actual flux without a planet is F_total_spot = (3.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when we see it, we always see the entire star, but parts of it are cooler.

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = (3.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ (5000)^4 

Wait, no. Because the entire star is emitting, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are part of what we see. Otherwise, when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see them. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 

= 1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 

And when the other hemisphere is facing us, all the surface we see is at 6000 K, except the spots are on the far side, so don't contribute. So:

F_unspotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 

So the amplitude variation from the spots is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Let me compute that.

delta_F_spots = F_unspotty - F_spotty 

= 2 π R² σ (6000^4) - [ 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) ]

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ (6000^4 ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Yes, same as before.

Now, the planet's dip is (Rpl^2 / R^2) * F_total_spot.

Wait, F_total_spot is the total flux of the star, which is:

F_total_spot = 3.6 π R² σ (6000^4 ) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

But when the planet transits, it blocks part of the star's surface. So the observed flux is F_total_spot * (1 - (Rpl^2)/(R^2) )

So the dip is F_total_spot * (Rpl^2 / R^2 )

Wait, but in the problem, it says "if the star was not covered by spots!" So F_total would be the normal star's flux, at Teff=6000 K. So F_total = 4 π R² σ (6000^4 )

So, the planet's dip is (Rpl^2 / R^2 ) * F_total.

We need this to equal the spot's dip.

So,

(Rpl^2 / R^2 ) * 4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Simplify:

(Rpl^2 ) * 4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Cancel π, σ, R²:

4 Rpl^2 (6000^4 ) = 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Divide both sides by 4:

Rpl^2 (6000^4 ) = 0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Solve for Rpl^2:

Rpl^2 = [0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (6000^4 )

= 0.1 [ 1 - (5000/6000 )^4 ]

As before, (5/6)^4≈0.482253.

So,

Rpl^2 = 0.1 (1 - 0.482253 ) = 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747

Take square root:

Rpl ≈ sqrt(0.0517747 ) ≈ 0.2276 R

Wait, 0.2276 is about 0.23 R. But the options don't have that. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I confused the area calculation. Let me re-calculate the dip due to the spots.

Wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, it's F_unspotty.

So the variation is F_unspotty - F_spotty = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The planet's dip is (Rpl^2 / R^2 ) * F_total, where F_total is 4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 )

So,

(Rpl^2 / R^2 ) *4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 ) =0.4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Simplify:

4 Rpl^2 σ (6000^4 ) =0.4 R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, no. Wait, R is the radius of the star.

Wait, let me re-express everything correctly.

The planet's dip is:

delta_F_planet = ( (Rpl / R )^2 ) * F_total

F_total is 4 π R² σ Teff^4

So,

delta_F_planet = (Rpl^2 / R²) *4 π R² σ Teff^4 =4 π R² σ Teff^4 (Rpl^2 / R² )

=4 π σ Rpl² Teff^4.

So,

4 π σ Rpl² (6000^4 ) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Cancel π, σ:

4 Rpl² (6000^4 ) = 0.4 R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Rpl² = [0.4 R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 *6000^4 ] 

= (0.4/4) * R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 

= 0.1 R² [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

= 0.1 R² ( 1 - 0.482253 )

= 0.1 R² *0.517747 

=0.0517747 R² 

Rpl = sqrt(0.0517747) R ≈ 0.2276 R

Hmm, still getting 0.2276 R. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the problem.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the star's brightness variation due to the spots is the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they aren't.

The star's brightness when the spots are visible is F_spotty.

When the spots are not visible (other hemisphere), it's F_unspotty.

The amplitude is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F_unspotty.

Similarly, the planet transit causes a dip of (Rpl^2 / R^2).

Wait, but the problem says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve". So the amplitude is the same in terms of fractional change.

So,

(F_unspotty - F_spotty)/F_unspotty = Rpl^2 / R^2

Compute the left side:

(F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F_unspotty 

= [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2 π R² σ (6000^4 ) ]

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 (6000^4 ) ]

= 0.2 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.1035494.

So,

(Rpl/R)^2 = 0.1035494 

Rpl/R = sqrt(0.1035494 ) ≈ 0.3218 R.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, that's a different approach. So perhaps this is the correct way.

Wait, because the amplitude as a fraction is delta_F / F.

So the spot's amplitude is (F_unspotty - F_spotty)/F_unspotty.

The planet's amplitude is (F_total * (Rpl^2/R^2 )) / F_total = Rpl^2 / R^2.

Wait, but when the planet transits, the dip is (Rpl^2/R^2) of the total flux.

But in the spot case, the dip is (F_unspotty - F_spotty)/F_unspotty.

So setting these equal:

(Rpl/R)^2 = (F_unspotty - F_spotty)/F_unspotty 

Which is what I just did.

So,

(Rpl/R)^2 = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 (6000^4 ) ]

= 0.4/2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) 

= 0.2 * (1 - 0.482253 )

= 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549 

Rpl/R ≈ sqrt(0.103549 ) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Ah, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering the fractional amplitude, but instead equating absolute flux values. The correct approach is to set the fractional dip equal.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star's dark spots, we compare the fractional change in brightness for both scenarios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \)
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \) (i.e., \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).

2. **Planet Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{pl}} \), to be determined.
   - The planet transits the star, causing a dip in brightness proportional to the area it blocks: \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).

3. **Brightness Variation from Spots**:
   - The total flux from the star is the sum of contributions from the unspotted and spotted areas:
     \[
     F_{\text{total}} = (3.6 \pi R^2) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + (0.4 \pi R^2) \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4
     \]
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1.6 \pi R^2) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + (0.4 \pi R^2) \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4
     \]
   - When the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotty}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spots}} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{unspotty}}}
     \]

4. **Brightness Variation from a Planet**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by the planet is:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]

### Calculation:
1. **Spot-Induced Brightness Variation**:
   Substituting the flux expressions:
   \[
   F_{\text{unspotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}} = 0.4 \pi R^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4 \right)
   \]
   The fractional amplitude is:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spots}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4 \right)}{2 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spots}} = \frac{0.4}{2} \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
   \]
   Using \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.482253 \right) \approx 0.2 \times 0.517747 \approx 0.103549
   \]

2. **Planet-Induced Brightness Variation**:
   The fractional amplitude for the planet is:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
   \]
   Setting \( \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spots}} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.103549
   \]
   Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.103549} \approx 0.3218
   \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.
