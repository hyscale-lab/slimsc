Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. Let me read the problem again.

The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Lagrangians, but I think this describes how the boson X interacts with fermions. The fermion fields are ψ_f, which probably stands for different types of fermions like quarks or leptons.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it has to produce particles whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV because energy and momentum conservation must hold. Also, the decay products should be allowed by the interaction terms in the Lagrangian.

Looking at the options, all the possible decay products are combinations of fermions and their antiparticles. For example, X → b b̄, which is a bottom quark and antiquark pair.

First, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced. Since the interaction term involves ψ_f, which is a fermion field, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair for which the interaction term is present.

Wait, but the interaction is given as -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Maybe this is a Yukawa-like interaction, similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions. In the Standard Model, the Higgs coupling strength (λ) varies for different fermions. But in this problem, the exact value of λ may not matter; it's more about which fermions are present.

Wait, but the interaction term might be written in a way that f and ψ_f are the same? Or perhaps f is the fermion's flavor. Hmm, perhaps the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ_f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), meaning that for each fermion species f, there's a coupling λ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided that the mass allows it.

So, the allowed decay products are any pairs of fermions where the sum of the masses is less than or equal to X's mass, which is 6 GeV. But wait, for pair production, each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass because each would get at least half the energy in the rest frame. So each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV.

Wait, because in the rest frame of X, the maximum energy each particle can have is when the other is at rest. So for a fermion f, the mass m_f must be ≤ m_X /2. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So, let me list the masses of all known fermions:

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (approx 4.5 GeV)
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV, so way over 3 GeV.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, practically 0.

So, for quarks, which ones have mass less than 3 GeV? All except top. But wait, the top is way beyond 3 GeV, so only u, d, s, c, and b. But wait, wait: the mass of the bottom is ~4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So for X to decay into b b̄, each b has a mass of ~4.5 GeV, but 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is way larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So that's not possible. So, bottom quarks can't be produced in pairs because each is 4.5 GeV, so two of them would require X to have at least 9 GeV, which it doesn't.

Wait, but the quarks are produced as a pair, so the minimum mass of X would need to be 2 * m_f. So for b quark, 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV. Since X is only 6 GeV, it can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in the problem, one of the options includes b b̄. So maybe I'm missing something here. Or perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the masses.

Wait, perhaps the fermion mass considered is their current masses. Let me get the approximate masses right.

- u: ~2.2 MeV
- d: ~4.7 MeV
- s: ~95 MeV
- c: ~1.27 GeV
- b: ~4.7 GeV (sometimes given as around 4.5 GeV)
- t: ~173 GeV.

So, for each fermion f, 2 m_f must be ≤ m_X.

So, m_X is 6 GeV. So 2 m_f ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion:

u: 2.2 MeV → okay.
d: 4.7 MeV → okay.
s: 95 MeV → okay.
c: 1.27 GeV → 2.54 GeV ≤6 → okay.
b: ~4.7 GeV → 9.4 GeV >6 → not allowed.
t: way higher, no.

So, the fermions that can be produced are u, d, s, c, and the leptons.

Now, looking at leptons:

e: 0.511 MeV → okay.
μ: 105.7 MeV → okay.
τ: 1.78 GeV → 2 * 1.78 =3.56 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 3.56 <6 → yes, so τ can be produced.

Wait, wait, for τ, 2*m_τ = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into τ+ τ−.

What about the neutrinos? Their masses are negligible, so in theory, X could decay into ν ν̄, but the problem's options don't list them. So perhaps the interaction doesn't include neutrinos, or the problem is considering only charged leptons.

Wait, the Lagrangian in the question has ψ_f, which for leptons would include charged leptons (like e, μ, τ) and neutrinos. But in the interaction term, perhaps the structure is such that it couples to charged fermions only. Or maybe it's written in a way that includes both, but decays into neutrinos would require negligible mass. But since the options don't include neutrinos, perhaps we can ignore them.

So, allowed fermions for decay are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

But wait, the options don't have u and d. Let me check the options:

Option A: allows b, s, u, d, tau+, e+.

Wait, but earlier I thought that b is too heavy. Oh wait, option A includes b, but according to our calculation, X cannot decay into b b̄ because each b is ~4.5 GeV, which exceeds 3 GeV.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the bottom quark? Let me double-check. Some sources say the mass of the bottom quark is around 4.7 GeV, but maybe in certain contexts, it's considered lower? Or perhaps in the problem, it's considered that the mass is 3 GeV or lower. Wait, the problem states that the mass of X is 6 GeV, so 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So, bottom quark is m=4.5 GeV → 4.5>3 → cannot decay into b b̄. So any option containing b b̄ is incorrect. So looking at the options:

Option A includes b b̄.

Option B: no b, but includes c, s, u, d, mu, e, tau.

Wait, option B includes c, which has a mass of 1.27 GeV. 2*1.27 =2.54 GeV ≤6, so okay.

So, for the decay products, X can decay into any pair where the individual fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV. So possible fermion pairs are:

c c̄: 1.27 GeV each → 2.54 <6 → allowed.

s s̄: ~0.19 GeV each → 0.38 <6 → allowed.

u ū: 2.2 MeV each → allowed.

d d̄: ~4.7 MeV → 9.4 MeV → allowed.

tau tau: 1.78 GeV each → 3.56 GeV <6 → allowed.

mu+ mu-: 105.7 MeV each → 211.4 MeV → allowed.

e+ e-: allowed.

What about charm quarks? 1.27 GeV each, 2.54 <6. So, yes, c c̄ is allowed.

So the possible decay channels include c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau−, mu+, mu−, e+, e−.

Wait, but option B doesn't have tau+ tau−, wait let me check.

Wait the options as given:

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u u, d d, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, no—looking back, the options don't all list the same number. Let me recheck:

Options:

A) X→ b b̄, s s̄, u u, d d, tau+, e+ e−.

B) X→ c c̄, s s̄, u u, d d, tau+, mu+, e+ e−.

Wait, no, the options as listed:

Option A: X→ b̄, s̄, u, d, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u u, d d, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, looking back, the problem lists the options as:

A) X → b b̄,s s̄,u u, d d, τ+, τ−, e+ e−.

B) X → c c̄,s s̄,u u, d d, τ+, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

C) X → c c̄,s s̄,u u, d d, t t̄, τ+, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

D) X → b b̄, s s̄, u u, d d, τ+, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Wait, so options B and D have tau and mu pairs, but A has tau and e.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, X can decay into c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So which options match that?

Option B: includes c c̄, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all allowed.

Option D includes b, which we said is not allowed.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy.

So option B is the one that includes all the allowed decay channels.

But wait, what about the interaction Lagrangian? The problem states the interaction is -λf f(y) (v+X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this implies that the coupling is only to a specific type of fermion. Or perhaps for each fermion f, there's a coupling.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions, but in this problem, is the boson X coupling to all fermions or just specific ones?

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Perhaps this notation is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a Yukawa coupling where each fermion has a coupling λf.

Assuming that λf is non-zero for all fermions (or at least for the ones we're considering), then X can decay into any of the allowed fermion pairs based on mass.

So the allowed decay products are: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Looking at the options, option B includes all of these.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option B says X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. So that's correct.

But another point: the problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order." So considering that the interaction is through the Yukawa coupling, the decay amplitude is proportional to the mass of the fermion. Wait, no, the Yukawa coupling itself is proportional to the mass (in the Standard Model, the coupling is m_f for each fermion). So higher mass fermions would have stronger couplings, but in terms of decay rates, the rate depends on both the coupling squared and the phase space.

But for the purpose of this question, it's about which decays are kinematically allowed, regardless of their likelihood. So mass is the main factor here.

So, the correct answer should be the option that includes all the fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So among the options, option B includes c, which is allowed. Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have made a mistake regarding the bottom quark's mass. If the X is 6 GeV, and the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, then 2m_b is 9 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, it can't decay into b b̄.

So any option that includes b b̄ isn't possible. So options A and D are out because they include b. Only option B and C remain.

But option C includes top quark (t), which is way too heavy (173 GeV), so it's impossible. So only option B is left.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decays must satisfy energy and momentum conservation, meaning the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Additionally, the interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must correspond to fermion-antifermion pairs.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraint**: For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)), the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Quarks:
     - \( u \): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
     - \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
     - \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
     - \( c \): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
     - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far exceeds \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - Leptons:
     - \( e \): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
     - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
     - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
     - Neutrinos: Negligible mass (not relevant as they are not listed in the options).

3. **Allowed Decay Products**: Based on the mass constraint, the allowed fermion-antifermion pairs are:
   - \( c \bar{c} \)
   - \( s \bar{s} \)
   - \( u \bar{u} \)
   - \( d \bar{d} \)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
   - \( e^+ e^- \)

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed as \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
