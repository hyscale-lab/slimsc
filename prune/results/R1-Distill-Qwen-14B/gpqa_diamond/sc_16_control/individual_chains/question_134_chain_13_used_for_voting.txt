Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed together.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here the concentrations and volumes are different, so I can't just use that directly.

First, I should probably figure out how much each acid and base contributes. Since HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base, right? But I need to balance the moles of H+ from the acids and OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. Wait, does it donate two H+ ions? Yes, because it's a strong acid, both H+ ions are released. So for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 moles of OH-.

Now, I need to compute the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, determine which is in excess because the neutralization will depend on that.

Let's calculate each step by step.

First, the moles of HCl: volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl gives 1 H+ per mole, that's 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now, Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28 mol and OH- is 0.2 mol. Which is in excess? H+ is higher, so OH- will be the limiting reagent. The reaction will proceed until OH- is consumed, and the excess H+ will remain.

The neutralization reaction between acids and base would be H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases about 57 kJ (or 23.7 kcal, since 1 cal is about 4.184 J). Wait, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since 1 mole H+ and 1 mole OH- make 1 mole H2O). So each mole of H+ and OH- pair releases 57 kJ.

Wait, but in this case, we have 0.2 moles of OH- (since Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-). So the reaction would consume 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O. The enthalpy change for this would be 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up the units here. Oh, because the options have kcal and kJ. Let me think: 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. No, wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184 (since 1 cal = 4.184 J). So 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal per mole. So each mole of H+ and OH- pair releases about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, but wait, the standard enthalpy for neutralization is usually given as -57 kJ/mol (per mole of H+). So for 0.2 mol, that's 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, in kcal, that's -11,400 J / 4,184 ≈ approximately -2.72 kcal (since 4,184 J is 1 kcal). So 11,400 / 4,184 ≈ 2.723. So it's about -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the options have both kJ and kcal. Let me check the options again.

Option A is -2.72 kcal. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, why are there two units? Let me think again. The problem asks for enthalpy in what unit? The options have both, but perhaps the correct calculation is in kcal.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the heat released per mole of H+ and OH- pair. So 0.2 mol H+ and OH- pairs would release 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But that's negative, so -11.4 kJ, which is option D if that were the case. But option D is -16.0 kJ, so that doesn't match.

Alternatively, if we compute in kcal, it's 0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal, so -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about the actual reaction. The neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH- to form water. The amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. Which is the limiting reagent here?

H+ from the acids is 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol. So only 0.2 mol of H+ will react with 0.2 mol OH-. The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol, but that doesn't contribute to the neutralization reaction. So the moles of water formed is 0.2 mol. Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, as I thought earlier, 57 kJ is per mole of H+ and OH- pair. So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, but negative.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 0.2 * 13.6 is about 2.72, but 0.2 *57 is 11.4 kJ. So the correct answer in kJ would be -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. Wait, looking at the options: option B is -11.42 kcal and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+ (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+).

So total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH- (each gives 2 OH-).

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the moles of H+ after reaction is 0.28 - 0.2 =0.08 mol H+ left. The OH- is all consumed.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 mol. The heat released is 0.2 *57 kJ=11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That doesn't match. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess. Let me try that.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- =0.2 mol.

The reaction will proceed until one is exhausted. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 mol OH- reacts, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

So the neutralization produces 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ of heat. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B which is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is not 11.4 kcal. Because 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. Wait, that can't be right. Let me convert 11.4 kJ to kcal.

11.4 kJ = 11400 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which matches option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the neutralization releases 0.2 *57 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal. So the correct answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if the calculation were done in kJ and then converted, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait another way: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H2O, which is 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles of H2O would release 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, the question says 'enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed.' Oh, but wait, maybe I should consider the dilution effect as well, but I think that's beyond the scope of what's being asked here. The question is probably assuming that the only heat comes from the neutralization reaction.

So based on that, the answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids and OH⁻ from the base.

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, and each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \implies 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, and each mole contributes 2 moles of H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \implies 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

   Total moles of H⁺ from acids:  
   \[
   0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

3. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, and each mole contributes 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \implies 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻}.
   \]

4. **Limiting Reagent**:  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since there are 0.28 mol H⁺ and 0.2 mol OH⁻, OH⁻ is the limiting reagent. Only 0.2 mol of H⁺ reacts with 0.2 mol of OH⁻ to form 0.2 mol of H₂O.

5. **Enthalpy Change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \(-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}\) or \(-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}\) for the reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \). For 0.2 mol of H₂O formed:  
   \[
   \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   Converting to kcal:  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization is \(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\), which corresponds to option A.
