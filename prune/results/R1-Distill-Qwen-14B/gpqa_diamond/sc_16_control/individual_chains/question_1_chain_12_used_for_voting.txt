Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let me try to work through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find their energy difference such that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with energy and time. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the uncertainty in time. Or wait, maybe it's ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2, where τ is the lifetime. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

So the lifetime here is the lifetime of the states. For energy levels, the lifetime relates to the uncertainty in energy. If the lifetime is shorter, the energy uncertainty is larger, right? Because if something doesn't last very long, you can't measure its energy very precisely.

The question is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between them (ΔE) needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart—they'd look like one state.

So each state has its own uncertainty. Let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1, which has a lifetime of τ1 = 1e-9 s, the uncertainty ΔE1 is about ħ/τ1. Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 is ħ/τ2.

Wait, but to resolve two states, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just greater than each of their individual uncertainties? Hmm, because if ΔE is greater than either ΔE1 or ΔE2, then each state's energy is separated by more than their own uncertainty, so the peaks in their line widths won't overlap.

Wait, the line width in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So for two lines, if their separation is greater than the sum of their widths, you can distinguish them. Or perhaps each line's width is such that their separation is bigger than each's width. I'm not entirely sure about the exact condition.

But let's calculate the uncertainties first. Let me recall that ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I might need to convert units.

First, compute ħ in eV·s. I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s. Yeah, that's a number I've come across before.

So, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 ≈ (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly for E2: τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, τ is the lifetime, so the uncertainty is inversely proportional to τ. So a longer lifetime means a narrower energy uncertainty. So E2 has a longer lifetime, so its energy uncertainty is smaller. So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2.

Now, to distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if it's less than the sum, their energy ranges might overlap, making them indistinct.

Alternatively, some sources say that the separation should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties for the lines to be resolved. That's similar to how in spectroscopy, the resolving power depends on the instrument's ability to separate peaks based on their linewidths.

So let me compute the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me compute each again.

Wait, τ1 is 1e-9 s, so ħ/τ1 is 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ħ/τ2 is 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the sum of the uncertainties would be 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait, maybe the sum is not the right approach. Because each state's uncertainty is the width of its own line. So the separation between the two lines must be larger than the sum of their individual widths. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the lines would overlap.

Wait, but another approach: The condition for two lines to be resolved is that the separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. Or maybe just each half-width. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the separation ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty of each state. Because if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then each state's energy is sufficiently separated from the other. For example, if E2 is higher than E1 by more than ΔE1 and ΔE2, then their energies are distinct.

Wait, that might make more sense. Because if the separation is larger than the individual uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. Because the uncertainty of E2 is smaller than that of E1. So the separation only needs to be bigger than the larger uncertainty? Or perhaps each.

Wait, let's think about it. If ΔE is bigger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two energy levels are well separated. Because each level's energy is known within their respective uncertainties, and their separation is larger than either, so the energies don't overlap.

So in this case, the larger uncertainty is from E1, which is 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than 6.58e-7 eV to be clearly resolved.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. Not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → way smaller. Also no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7. So yes, this would be sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.1e-7 eV. Still smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So not enough.

So the only option where the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in calculating the uncertainty for each state?

Wait, let me compute the numbers again.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1.

ħ is 6.58e-16 eV·s.

τ1 is 1e-9 s.

So ΔE1 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So indeed, the larger uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than that. So the minimum is just above 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 10^-4 eV.

Wait, 10^-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7 eV (which is about 0.000000658 eV). So yes, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than the required 6.58e-7 eV, so it would definitely be distinguishable.

The other options are too small. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). 

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This ensures that the energy ranges of the two states do not overlap.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clear distinction is **Option C**.
