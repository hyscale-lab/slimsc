Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. We’re told to assume the stars are black bodies and find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the key here is to find the ratio of their luminosities, which would be (R1/R2)²*(T1/T2)^4.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh, the peak wavelength. I think that's where the star emits the most light, which is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that λ_max * T = constant. So λ is inversely proportional to T. If λ is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ is the same, T1 = T2? That makes sense. So T1 over T2 is 1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then T must be the same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So yeah, same λ_max implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

So then the luminosity ratio would be (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, that part is 1. So the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2.

But wait, R1 is 1.5 R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the answer should be A) ~2.25.

But wait, I might be missing something. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the calculation?

Oh, right! The observed wavelength (what the astronomer measures) is affected by the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. But in the question, it says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. That is, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same.

Wait, so Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed λ is the same as its emitted λ. But Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let me compute the Doppler shift for Star_2.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) 

Wait, but that's when v is much smaller than the speed of light. Alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), but that's valid only for small velocities compared to c.

Wait, but both stars have the same observed λ_max. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs

But λ1_obs is the same as λ1_emitted, because Star_1 has v_r=0.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength would be longer (redshift). But in this case, the observed λ_max for both is same.

Wait, but in the problem, Star_1's radial velocity is 0 and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Let's clarify the direction. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But radial velocity could be towards or away. I think the formula for Doppler shift depends on whether the source is moving towards or away.

If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). If moving towards, shorter (blueshift).

In the problem, Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so no shift. Star_2's is 700 km/s. I think I need to know the direction, but the question didn't specify. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s". I think the radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So 700 km/s could be moving away or towards, but that affects the observed wavelength.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So regardless of their actual velocities, their observed λ_max is same.

So for Star_2, its emitted wavelength is λ2_emit, but due to velocity, the observed λ is λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c), if moving away. Or (1 - v_r/c) if moving towards.

Wait, no, the exact Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + (v_r/c)) / (1 - (v_r/c)) )

But if v_r is positive when moving away, then λ_obs > λ_emit. So if Star_1's λ_emit1 is λ1, and Star_2's λ_emit2 is λ2. But since they observed the same λ_obs, which is same for both.

So:

λ_obs = λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + (v2/c)) / (1 - (v2/c)) )

Wait, because Star_1 has v_r = 0, so no shift. So λ_obs1 = λ1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let me compute v2 in terms of c. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333 c. So v/c is about 0.002333.

So the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt(1.002333 / 0.997667) ≈ sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234 (using approximation that sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 for small x).

So Star_2's observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * 1.00234. But according to the problem, λ_obs for Star_2 is the same as Star_1's λ_obs, which is λ1_emit.

So:

λ1 = λ2 * 1.00234.

But wait, from Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T. So λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2.

But wait, in the earlier assumption, I thought λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 because λ_obs was same. But now, with Doppler shift, that's not the case. So:

Wait no, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_emit is same as λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs is λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But from Wien's Law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to T. So λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c)/(1 + v_r/c) )

Hmm, but v_r is 700 km/s. Let me compute the ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c).

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.00233333...

So (1 - 0.0023333)/(1 + 0.0023333) = (0.99766667)/(1.00233333) ≈ 0.995348.

So the square root of that is about sqrt(0.995348) ≈ 0.99767.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99767.

Wait, so T1 is less than T2? Because 0.99767 is less than 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that λ_emit for both stars would be same, but now it's different. Because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me try to rephrase this.

When you observe a star moving away, you see a longer wavelength (redshift). So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_obs is longer than its emitted λ_emit.

But according to the problem, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So Star_1's emitted λ_emit1 is same as Star_2's observed λ_obs2.

So:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c) [approximated for small v/c].

So λ_emit1 ≈ λ_emit2 * (1 + 0.002333).

But from Wien's Law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to T. So:

λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 ≈ (1 + 0.002333).

Which implies T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the equations properly.

Wien’s Law: λ_max = b / T.

For Star_1, λ_max1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ_max2 = b / T2.

But the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_obs2 = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

Wait, no. The observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

So:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 = λ_max1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So:

λ_max1 = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

But λ_max1 = b / T1, and λ_max2 = b / T2.

So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) )

Wait, let me compute this sqrt((1 - x)/(1 + x)) where x is v_r2/c.

x = 700e3 / 3e5 = 700/300,000 = 0.002333...

So sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) = sqrt( 0.997667 / 1.002333 ) ≈ sqrt(0.995348) ≈ 0.99767.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is about 0.99767 times T2. So T1 < T2.

Hmm, that's a small difference. So how does this affect the luminosity?

Luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1²/R2² = (2.25).

T1 = T2 * 0.99767.

So T1^4 = (0.99767)^4 * T2^4.

Compute (0.99767)^4.

Let's approximate:

0.99767 ≈ 1 - 0.00233.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x when x is small.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 1 - 4 * 0.00233 = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.99068.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99068 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, so approximately 2.227. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767 squared first: (0.99767)^2 = approximately 0.99535.

Then square that: (0.99535)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So yes, about 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, 2.227 is close to option D) ~2.23. Or option A is 2.25, which is the initial calculation without considering the Doppler effect.

So now I'm a bit torn. Because the Doppler effect introduces a small correction, making the luminosity ratio a bit less than 2.25.

Wait, but why was the Doppler effect considered? Because the observed λ is same, but the emitted λ isn't. So the initial assumption that T1=T2 was incorrect. They actually have slightly different temperatures.

So with the Doppler effect, the correct ratio is about 2.227, which is approximately 2.23, matching option D.

But wait, let me compute more precisely.

Compute (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) = 0.997667 / 1.002333.

Compute this ratio:

Using exact division: 0.997667 / 1.002333 = ?

Well, let me compute 0.997667 / 1.002333.

Let me compute 0.997667 / 1.002333:

Approximately, 0.997667 ≈ 0.997667

1.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So 0.997667 / 1.002333 = (1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) = [ (1 - x) / (1 + x) ] where x = 0.002333.

The exact calculation is (1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ (0.997667)/(1.002333).

Calculating this: 0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.995348.

So the square root of 0.995348 is sqrt(0.995348) ≈ 0.99767.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute 0.99767^4 accurately.

Compute 0.99767^2 first:

0.99767 * 0.99767.

Let me compute:

= (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 0.9953454289.

Then square that: (0.9953454289)^2.

Again, using (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small.

Here, x is 0.0046545711 (since 1 - 0.9953454289 = 0.0046545711).

So (0.9953454289)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.0046545711) = 1 - 0.009309142 ≈ 0.990690858.

So it's approximately 0.99069.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 is 1.5, so squared is 2.25.

Multiply by 0.99069: 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.227.

So approximately 2.227, which is ~2.23.

Looking back at the options, D is ~2.23.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the given data
- **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25 \).
- **Mass**: The mass ratio is also 1.5, but mass does not directly affect luminosity in this context.
- **Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed wavelength of maximum brightness (\( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)).
- **Radial velocities**: Star_1 has \( v_r = 0 \), and Star_2 has \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

### Step 2: Relating temperature to wavelength
From Wien's Law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)), the emitted wavelengths must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

Here, \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300000} \approx 0.002333
\]

The Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx 1.00234
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot 1.00234
\]

From Wien's Law, \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \), so:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_r/c}{1 + v_r/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature ratio to the fourth power
\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.00233 \):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068
\]

### Step 4: Compute the luminosity ratio
Substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The computed luminosity ratio is approximately \( 2.23 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
