Okay, so I've got this question about quorum-sensing peptides and their effects on yeast. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that a new quorum-sensing peptide was found in Lactobacillus acidophilus. They treated yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with this peptide and observed the formation of the shmoo. Now, they want to look into the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The question is about identifying which complex's proteins will be least present in their assay.

So first, I need to recall what each of these complexes does and where they are active in the cell.

The options are:

A) nucleosome histone complex
B) pre-replication complex
C) pre-initiation complex
D) enhancer protein complex

Let me break them down one by one.

The nucleosome histone complex is the basic unit of chromatin structure. Histones package DNA into nucleosomes, which are essential for chromatin organization. So this is a structural component, always present in chromatin. So probably a lot of these proteins would be found in any chromatin sample, so they might not be the least observed.

The pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is involved in DNA replication. It's a complex that marks sites for replication origins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The formation of the pre-RC is essential for initiating DNA replication. But when does this happen? In the G1 phase. So if the yeast cells are in a particular phase when the peptide is applied, maybe the pre-RC isn't active, but I'm not sure how this relates to the observed effect of the peptide causing the shmoo.

The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is involved in the initiation of transcription. It's a collection of proteins that assemble on the promoter region of a gene to initiate RNA synthesis. The PIC includes factors like RNA polymerase, transcription factors, etc. So if the chromatin is active (like in regions being transcribed), these proteins would be present. Since the assay is looking at active chromatin, the PIC proteins should be present, so they might not be the least observed.

The enhancer protein complexâ€”I think enhancers are regions of DNA that increase the transcription of genes. Proteins that bind to enhancers, like certain transcription factors, would be part of this complex. Enhancers are active in gene regulation, so if the chromatin is active, these proteins should be present. But I'm not sure how this compares to the other options.

The question is about which complex's proteins are least present. So, which of these complexes is not active in the chromatin that's being studied, which is the active chromatin in the shmoo.

Now, what causes the formation of the shmoo? The shmoo is a cell shape change in yeast, induced by the mating pheromone. It's a signal that the yeast is preparing for mating. This involves changes in the cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion. But more importantly, the formation of the shmoo is linked to the activation of the mating pathway, which involves the MAP kinase signaling cascade. This might affect gene expression programs related to mating, like upregulating certain genes involved in cell-cell communication or adhesion.

In terms of chromatin, active chromatin regions are open and transcriptionally active. So the proteins involved in transcription initiation (like pre-initiation complex) and maybe enhancers would be present. Also, the nucleosome structure is a part of the chromatin, so histones would be there.

But the pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which doesn't necessarily tie directly into the shmoo formation unless the cell is preparing to divide. However, during the G1 phase, the pre-RC is formed to prepare for S phase. But if the cell is in a non-dividing state (like during mating), maybe the pre-RC isn't active. Alternatively, if the treatment induces a cell cycle arrest, perhaps the pre-RC isn't active. Alternatively, maybe the mating pheromone leads to cell cycle arrest, so pre-RC would not be formed, hence their proteins wouldn't be present in active chromatin.

Wait, but the treatment here is the quorum-sensing peptide from bacteria. They induced the formation of the shmoo, which is similar to the response induced by mating pheromone. So the yeast cells are responding as if they're in the mating phase, which typically leads to cell cycle arrest in G1. So in that case, the pre-replication complex wouldn't be active because the cell isn't progressing into S phase. Therefore, proteins from the pre-replication complex (option B) would be least present.

The other options: A (nucleosome histone) is always present. C (pre-initiation) would be present in active transcription regions. D (enhancer) is part of transcription regulation, so if genes are being transcribed, these proteins would be present.

So the least likely to be observed is the pre-replication complex.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae treated with a quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus, leading to the formation of the shmoo. The shmoo is associated with mating and cell cycle changes, particularly G1 arrest, which affects chromatin activity.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Nucleosome Histone Complex (A):**  
   This is the structural core of chromatin, essential for packaging DNA. Histones and nucleosome proteins are always present in chromatin, regardless of activity. Thus, these proteins are expected to be abundant in the assay.

2. **Pre-Replication Complex (B):**  
   The pre-replication complex (pre-RC) marks replication origins during G1 phase and is involved in DNA replication. Since the shmoo formation is linked to mating and G1 arrest, the pre-RC is unlikely to be active in this context. Therefore, proteins from this complex are expected to be the least observed.

3. **Pre-Initiation Complex (C):**  
   The pre-initiation complex (PIC) is involved in transcription initiation and is active in regions of transcriptionally active chromatin. Since the shmoo involves gene expression changes, PIC proteins are likely to be present in the assay.

4. **Enhancer Protein Complex (D):**  
   Enhancer proteins regulate gene expression by binding to enhancer regions. Active chromatin in transcriptionally active regions would include these proteins, making them likely to be observed in the assay.

### Conclusion:
The pre-replication complex (B) is the least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin in the shmoo, as its activity is tied to DNA replication, which is not relevant during G1 arrest induced by the mating response. 

Answer: B
