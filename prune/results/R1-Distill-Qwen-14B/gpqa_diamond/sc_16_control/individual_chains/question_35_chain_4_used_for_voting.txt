Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is given. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c in, Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, look at the options and see which statement is correct.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write down Ay - a I. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]].

So, Ay - a I would be:

[(h/(4π)*0 - a), (h/(4π)*(-i))],
[(h/(4π)*i), (h/(4π)*0 - a)]

Wait, no, wait. Ay is cS, so each element is c times the corresponding element of S. So the elements are:

Top left: 0 * c = 0
Top right: (-i) * c = -i c
Bottom left: i * c = i c
Bottom right: 0 * c = 0

So, Ay is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]

So the characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So:

| -a      -i c       |
| i c      -a       |  = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( -i c * i c )

Wait, let's compute each term:

The product of the diagonal elements is ( -a )*( -a ) = a².

The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( -i² ) c². Since i squared is -1, this becomes (-(-1)) c² = (1) c² = c².

But wait, in the determinant formula, it's (Ay - a I) is:

[ [ -a , -i c ],
  [ i c, -a ] ]

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Which is a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

But (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = +1. So,

determinant = a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0

So the equation is a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are c and -c.

Wait, what's c? c is h/(4π), so a is h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's see each option.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2π h, and real part ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator should be real, right? Because angular momentum components are Hermitian. Wait, Ay is c * S. Is S Hermitian?

Wait, S is given as [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Let me check if it's Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, -i], [i, 0]] because taking the transpose and complex conjugate. Since S's transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], and the conjugate would swap the i to -i. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, S is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

The conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns, and take complex conjugate.

So for S†, the (1,1) element is 0, (1,2) is i (since S's (2,1) is i, and conjugate is -i? Wait no, wait.

Wait, S's transpose is:

Column 1: 0, i

Column 2: -i, 0

So for S†, each element is the conjugate.

So S† would be:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Which is the same as S itself. So S is Hermitian.

So Ay is c * S, which is c times a Hermitian matrix. So Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be real.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are ±c, which are real. So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any option suggesting the eigenvalues have imaginary parts would be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Eigenvalue imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero. So this option is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. But again, eigenvalues are real, so any imaginary part would be incorrect. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think about this.

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum components don't commute. So, for example, A_x, A_y, A_z don't commute with each other. However, for a given state, if it's an eigenstate of A_y, can it also be an eigenstate of A²?

A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is a Casimir operator. Its eigenvalues are known for each representation. Since A is the intrinsic angular momentum (like spin), it's a vector operator whose components satisfy [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z and similar commutators.

But the square of the operator A² is equal to (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²). So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y (Ay), can it also be an eigenstate of A²?

Well, for spin systems, all states are eigenstates of A². For example, for spin-1/2 particles, A² has eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ². So any state is an eigenstate of A², regardless of its A_y eigenstate.

So if Ay has eigenvalue a, then A² would have eigenvalue a² + something? Wait, no—A² is the sum of squares of all components. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Az or Ax, but it can still be an eigenstate of A².

So the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That sounds correct. Because A² commutes with all components (since it's the sum of squares), any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A² as well. But it's not an eigenstate of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

Wait, but in this question, the operator is Ay, which is a 2x2 matrix. So it's a spin-1/2 system. So A² should have eigenvalue (s(s+1))ħ², where s=1/2. So s(s+1)=3/4. So A² has eigenvalue (3/4)ħ². So any eigenstate of Ay must also be an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of option C says that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. That is correct because [Ay, Az] is not zero. So, their eigenstates are different. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not quite sure what this means. The basis functions of Ay would probably be the eigenfunctions because any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. But I think all Hermitian operators have their eigenvectors as a basis for the space, so this is true. Wait, but is this the case here?

Wait, the operator is 2x2, so it's a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions form a basis for this space, so they are the basis functions of Ay. So option D would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

Each eigenvector corresponds to an eigenstate, and since the operator is 2x2, there are two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct, which they are in this case because the eigenvalues are ±c). So the two eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct.

So, looking back at the options:

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D is also correct, but wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct? Or no.

Wait, the options are presented as four possible statements, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me read each option again.

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis of the matrix operator. So D is correct.

But the question asks which statement is correct. So perhaps there are two correct options. But in the given options, only one can be correct.

Wait, but let me think about option C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That is correct because, for a spin-1/2 system, all states are eigenstates of A² but only states aligned along a particular axis are eigenstates of that component.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are a basis (assuming they're orthogonal and normalized), D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the statements are about whether you need to consider certain things during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, Ay is a 2x2 matrix. It has two eigenvalues, ±h/(4π). The eigenvectors can be found by solving (Ay - a I)|ψ> = 0 for each a.

Let me find the eigenvectors.

For a = c = h/(4π):

(Ay - c I) is:

[ [ -c, -i c ],
  [ i c, -c ] ]

The equations are:

- c ψ1 - i c ψ2 = 0 → -ψ1 -i ψ2 = 0 → ψ1 = -i ψ2.

So the eigenvector can be written as (ψ1, ψ2) = (-i ψ2, ψ2). Let ψ2 = 1, then ψ1 = -i.

So the eigenvector is [-i, 1]^T. To normalize, the norm is | -i |² + |1|² = 1 + 1 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)(-i, 1).

Similarly, for a = -c:

(Ay + c I) is:

[ [ c, -i c ],
  [ i c, c ] ]

The equations are:

c ψ1 - i c ψ2 = 0 → ψ1 = i ψ2.

So the eigenvector is (i ψ2, ψ2) = ψ2 (i, 1). Let ψ2 = 1, then it's [i, 1]^T. Normalizing gives (1/√2)(i, 1).

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, this is correct. So D is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

As discussed, since A² is a Casimir operator and commutes with all components, any eigenstate of A_y must be an eigenstate of A². So the first part is correct.

As for Az: [Ay, Az] = iħ A_z? Wait, because for angular momentum operators, [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z. So [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x.

So eigenstates of Ay won't be eigenstates of Az, because they don't commute. So option C is correct.

So both options C and D seem correct. But looking back at the question, only one option can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So option D is correct.

But the question is about what to consider during the calculation. So when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you're solving the equation Ay φ = a φ. So the eigenfunctions are the solutions, which form a basis for the space. So option D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the problem says "which statement below will you consider to be correct during the calculation?"

So perhaps during the calculation, you don't consider the relation with A² or Az, just find the eigenvalues and vectors of Ay.

But in the options, the correct statements are about the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

Wait, options A and B are about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts, which isn't the case because Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. So A and B are incorrect.

So the correct options must be C or D.

Option C: eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Which is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the answer options, perhaps I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, but the operator Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two in number and orthogonal. So they form a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C's statement is correct.

So, the correct statements are C and D. But the options are given, so perhaps all correct statements are among the options.

But the problem says which one is correct, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, you're finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Which of the statements is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is correct because any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors form a basis.

Option C says they are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Which is correct.

But the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about which is a correct statement in general, but which statement is correct during the calculation process.

Hmm. So the question is not about the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, but about the process of calculation. So perhaps the correct statement is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions, which is a correct statement during the calculation.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors are two orthogonal vectors in a 2D space, which form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

So, in the options, both C and D seem correct, but perhaps only one is correct. But according to the problem statement, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the problem says the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are two in number, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

But earlier, I thought that option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me try to think about what the answer options are actually saying.

Looking at option C: the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Which is correct because all states are eigenstates of A² (since A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D, as it's a fact that you would use when calculating the eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because during the calculation, you might consider that the eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of A².

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

So, in that case, which one is correct? The options are: C and D are correct statements.

But the options are structured so that only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect because the basis functions are the standard basis, not the eigenvectors. No, the eigenvectors can form a basis as well.

Wait, no. The standard basis is just the computational basis (like |0> and |1>), but the eigenbasis is another basis.

So the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

So I think both C and D are correct, but perhaps in the given options, only C is correct or only D is correct.

But looking back, the question is about which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps the calculation doesn't involve A² or Az, so during the calculation, you don't consider whether the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of other operators.

Thus, the correct statements are about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So options A and B are incorrect because the eigenvalues are real. So the correct options are C and D.

But the question only allows one correct option, so perhaps I have to choose between C and D.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D. Because the calculation involves finding the eigenvectors which form a basis for the operator.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real, so options A and B can be eliminated.

Which leaves options C and D.

The question is during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So during the calculation, you're finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So the fact that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² is a separate consideration, but the calculation of eigenvalues and vectors doesn't directly involve that.

So perhaps the correct statement during the calculation is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which is option D.

Thus, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but another angle: the matrix has eigenfunctions which are orthogonal and can form a basis. So D is correct.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = h / 4\pi \) and \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct during the calculation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is Hermitian since \( S \) is Hermitian, and \( c \) is real. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) must be real.
   - The characteristic equation is \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm c = \pm h / 4\pi \). Thus, the eigenvalues are real, and any statement suggesting imaginary parts in the eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - Solving \( (A_y - aI)|\psi\rangle = 0 \) for \( a = \pm c \), the eigenvectors are found to be orthogonal and form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space. This makes option D correct, as the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of \( A_y \).

3. **Relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator of angular momentum, and its eigenvalues are the same for all eigenstates of \( A_y \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of angular momentum. Thus, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but they are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes option C correct.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct in general. However, the question asks which statement is correct "during the calculation" of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since the calculation primarily involves solving \( A_y \phi = a \phi \) and finding the eigenfunctions, the most relevant statement is that the eigenfunctions form a basis for \( A_y \), making option D the best choice.

### Conclusion:
Option D is the correct answer.

Answer: D
