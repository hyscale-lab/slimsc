Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm. Let me think through this carefully. I remember that when dealing with emission or excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution explains the distribution of particles in different energy states based on temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the ratio of their populations in that energy level is 2:1. Wait, but I think the ratio depends on the Boltzmann factor. The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels (n_upper and n_lower) is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by kT. So the formula is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight.

But wait, in this case, it's the same element (iron) in the same energy level for both stars, so the statistical weights (g) should be the same for both. So the ratio of the populations would just be exp(-ΔE/(kT)) for each star. Or wait, maybe I have the ratio reversed.

Wait, the question says that star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2. So, maybe for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) is twice that of star_2's. Or wait, no, the problem says iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me reread the question.

Ah, it says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So that means that the number of atoms in that particular energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's denote the number of atoms in the excited state as n1 for star_1 and n2 for star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the excitation is the probability per atom. So the excitation level could be the probability that an atom is in that state. So each atom has a certain probability of being in an excited state, and for star_1, that probability is twice that of star_2. Hmm, maybe that's the right way to think about it.

So the ratio would be (n_upper)_1 / (n_upper)_2 = 2. But wait, no, because n_upper depends on the number of atoms and the probability. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of (n_upper)_1/(n_upper)_2 = 2. But wait, perhaps the ratio of the populations of the two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, another approach: Let's say each star has the same number of iron atoms. Wait, no, the problem doesn't say that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excitation is the same as the ratio of the probabilities. So the probability that an atom is in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Because if more atoms are excited, the probability is higher.

So for each star, the probability P of being in the excited state is given by P = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Since it's the same element, the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars. So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 would be exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) / exp(-ΔE/(kT2)).

Wait, but wait, that would be for if the energy levels were in a higher state for a different temperature. Oh, no. Let me think again. The probability for a specific energy level is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So for a given level, the population is proportional to that. So if star_1's probability is twice that of star_2, then:

P1 = 2 P2

But P1 is (g_upper / g_total) * exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) and similarly for P2. But since the same element, g_upper and g_total are the same for both stars. So the ratio P1/P2 = exp( -ΔE/(kT1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(kT2) ) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(kT2) - ΔE/(kT1) )

Wait, because the ratio is [exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(kT2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(kT2) - ΔE/(kT1) )

So this ratio is equal to 2, since P1=2 P2.

So:

exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ] = 2

Taking natural log of both sides:

(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Rearranging:

(ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Wait, no, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) when we have a minus. Wait, let's compute it.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2). Because 1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2), and 1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2), so subtracting gives (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting back:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Now, the question gives ΔE as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the equation involves k, which is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so ΔE is equal to k, because 1.38e-23 J is approximately the value of k (which is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

Wait, wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So that's k. So ΔE = k.

So substituting that into our equation:

(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) /k

Wait, but wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K, but the equation has k in the denominator. Wait, let's re-express that:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)^(-1) * k? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me see.

Wait, the equation after substitution is:

(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Divide both sides by k:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / k

Wait, but wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and ΔE is given as k. So that's correct.

But wait the question is about finding an equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, our equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k) / k?

Wait, no, because when ΔE is k, then:

k*(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/(k) * 1.

But since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and the given ΔE is the same as k, then we can see that.

Wait, but the equation we're trying to form is ln(2) equals something with T1 and T2.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But our equation says (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Since ΔE = k, that becomes ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again.

We have:

P1/P2 = 2 = exp[ (ΔE/(k))( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

If ΔE = k, then (ΔE/k) is 1, so ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the distribution of atoms in energy levels, and the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning the probability of an atom being in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) / \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Given \( P_1 / P_2 = 2 \), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of \( k \) (Boltzmann's constant). Substituting \( \Delta E = k \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = k \cdot \frac{1}{T_2} - k \cdot \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\ln(2) = k \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the derived relationship between \( T_1 \), \( T_2 \), and the natural logarithm of 2.
