Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Also, the mass of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2. Interesting, so both the radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, how does mass relate to luminosity here? Because I remember that for stars, luminosity is related to both radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So Luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The problem also mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. That's a key point. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a minute. They have the same mass and radius, but same temperature? Because if their masses are the same ratio as their radii, and they have the same temperature, then their luminosities would be in the ratio of (R1/R2)^2, since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same for both. So let's compute that.

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But looking at the options, option A is 2.25. So that's a possible answer. But wait, there's more to the problem.

The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star 2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Radial velocity is about the motion of the star towards or away from us. But unless it's a Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So maybe the observed wavelengths are affected by the Doppler effect.

Wait, wait. So if Star 2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, the wavelengths we observe would be blueshifted. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual (rest) wavelengths might differ? Or does the Doppler shift affect the peak emission?

Wait, let's think. If a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths of its emitted light are blueshifted. So the observed peak wavelength is shorter. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So if Star 1 is at rest (0 km/s), its λ_max is b / T1. Star 2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, so its observed λ_max would be (b / T2) * sqrt( (c + v) / (c - v) )? Or wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how Doppler shift affects the peak wavelength.

The Doppler effect for light can be approximated by the formula: observed wavelength λ' = λ_rest * sqrt( (c + v)/ (c - v) ) for a source moving towards the observer at speed v. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let me recall: if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). The formula is λ' = λ * sqrt( (c - v) / (c + v) ) ), since the denominator would be c + v (as the source is approaching). Hmm, or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ' = λ ( (1 - β) / (1 + β) )^(1/2), where β is v/c. So when the source is moving towards the observer at speed v, β is positive, so λ' is less than λ. So the observed wavelength is shorter.

But in this problem, the brightest wavelengths (λ_max) for both stars are the same. So the observed λ1_max equals observed λ2_max. But their intrinsic λ_max could be different because of their Doppler velocities.

Wait, but Star 1 has v_r = 0, so its λ1_max is the rest wavelength: λ1_max = b / T1.

Star 2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's compute the Doppler shift for Star 2. Let me compute the Doppler factor. The speed is 700 km/s. Let's see, the speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.00233c. So beta is 0.00233. So beta is approximately 0.00233.

Wait, but for small velocities compared to c, the Doppler shift can be approximated as (1 + v/c), but wait, that's for the frequency shift. Let me think. The Doppler formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ' ≈ λ (1 - v/c). Because frequency increases, wavelength decreases.

Wait, but the exact formula is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), where β is v/c. Since beta is small here (0.00233), this can be approximated using a Taylor expansion.

Let me compute sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ) for β=0.00233.

Let me denote x = β = 0.00233.

So (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ (1 -x)(1 - x + x² - ...) ≈ 1 - 2x + 2x² for small x.

Wait, expanding (1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - x)(1 -x + x² - x^3 + ... ) = 1 - 2x + 2x² - 2x^3 + ... So for small x, it's approximately 1 - 2x.

Taking the square root: sqrt( (1 - 2x) ) ≈ 1 - x - (x²)/2, using the expansion sqrt(1 + a) ≈ 1 + a/2 for small a. Wait, no: sqrt(1 - 2x) ≈ 1 - x - x²/2.

Wait, perhaps a better approximation is to use the expansion sqrt(1 - y) ≈ 1 - y/2 - y²/8 for small y.

In our case, y = 2x. So sqrt(1 - 2x) ≈ 1 - (2x)/2 - ( (2x)^2 ) / 8 = 1 - x - (4x²)/8 = 1 - x - 0.5 x².

But since x is small (around 0.00233), x squared is negligible, so sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ≈ 1 - x.

So, the observed wavelength for Star 2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - x), where x is beta = v/c.

But wait, Star 2's intrinsic λ_max is λ2_rest = b / T2.

So for Star 2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ≈ λ2_rest * (1 - beta/2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recap.

We have:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta = v2/c, and v2 is 700 km/s.

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Hmm, but earlier we thought that T1 = T2 because they have the same observed λ_max. But wait, no, that's only if they are at rest. But since Star 2 is moving, the observed λ is different.

Wait, the problem says the observed λ for both stars is the same. So, the observed λ_max for Star 1 is λ1_obs = b / T1, and for Star 2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Set them equal:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Now, let's compute beta. v = 700 km/s, c is approx 299,792 km/s. So beta = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.002337.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1 + 0.002337)/(1 - 0.002337) ≈ (1.002337)/(0.997663) ≈ let's compute this.

1.002337 / 0.997663:

Let me compute it numerically.

1.002337 ≈ 1 + 0.002337

0.997663 ≈ 1 - 0.002337

So, (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ (1 + 2a) when a is small, using the approximation (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ (1 + 2a) for small a.

Here, a is 0.002337. So 2a is about 0.004674. So (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1.004674.

So sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ≈ sqrt(1.004674) ≈ let's compute this.

sqrt(1.004674) ≈ 1 + 0.004674/2 = 1.002337.

Wait, using the Taylor expansion: sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 for small x. So x is 0.004674, so sqrt ≈ 1 + 0.004674/2 = 1.002337.

So, T1 = T2 * 1.002337.

Hmm, so T1 is a little higher than T2.

Now, moving on to compute the luminosity. Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ T^4, so L is proportional to R² T^4.

Given that, Star 1 has R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 ≈ T2 * 1.002337.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2 )² / R2² ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Simplify:

(1.5)^2 * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

We have T1/T2 = 1.002337.

So,

(1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(1.002337)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute (1.002337)^4.

First, compute (1.002337)^2.

1.002337^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002337) + (0.002337)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004674 + ~0.00000546 ≈ 1.00467946.

Then, square that again:

(1.00467946)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00467946) + (0.00467946)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00935892 + ~0.0000219 ≈ 1.0093808.

So approximately 1.00938.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ ?

2.25 * 1.00938 = 2.25 * (1 + 0.00938) = 2.25 + 2.25 * 0.00938.

2.25 * 0.00938 ≈ 0.021105.

So, 2.25 + 0.021105 ≈ 2.2711.

Wait, but wait, our approximation for (1.002337)^4 was 1.00938. So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ ~2.27.

Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option C is ~2.35, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, none of the options exactly match 2.27. So perhaps my approximation is missing something.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value without approximating.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the Doppler shift. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) where beta is 700/299792 ≈ 0.002337.

Compute (1 + 0.002337)/(1 - 0.002337) = (1.002337)/(0.997663).

Let me compute this division accurately.

1.002337 ÷ 0.997663.

We can write this as (1 + 0.002337) / (1 - 0.002337).

Let me compute this as (1.002337) * (1.002337) / ( (1 - (0.002337)^2 ) ) ? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, using division:

Let me approximate 1.002337 / 0.997663.

Let me write it as (1 + 0.002337) / (1 - 0.002337) = [1 + a] / [1 - a], where a = 0.002337.

We know that [1 + a]/[1 - a] = (1 + a)(1 + a + a² + a³ + ... ), which for small a is approximately 1 + 2a + 2a².

So,

a = 0.002337.

2a = 0.004674.

2a² = 2*(0.002337)^2 ≈ 2*(0.00000546) ≈ 0.0000109.

So,

[1 + a]/[1 -a ] ≈ 1 + 2a + 2a² = 1 + 0.004674 + 0.0000109 ≈ 1.004685.

Wait, but wait, earlier I computed it as approximately 1.004674. Hmm, maybe a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps a calculator approach would be better. Let's compute 1.002337 / 0.997663.

Let me compute 1.002337 / 0.997663.

I can compute this as:

= (1.002337) / (0.997663) 

= Let me compute 1.002337 ÷ 0.997663.

I can approximate this as:

Let me write it as N = 1.002337, D=0.997663.

Compute N/D = approx 1.004674 as earlier.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it as:

Let me subtract 0.997663 from 1.002337: 1.002337 -0.997663 = 0.004674.

So N = D + 0.004674.

So N/D = 1 + 0.004674/D.

Since D ≈ 0.997663, 0.004674 / 0.997663 ≈ 0.004685.

So N/D ≈ 1 + 0.004685 = 1.004685.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1.004685.

So taking the square root of this:

sqrt(1.004685) = ?

We can use the Taylor expansion again.

sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/8 + ... for small x.

Here, x = 0.004685.

So x/2 = 0.0023425.

x² = (0.004685)^2 ≈ 0.00002193.

So,

sqrt(1.004685) ≈ 1 + 0.0023425 - 0.00002193/8 ≈ 1 + 0.0023425 - 0.00000274 ≈ 1.0023397.

So, T1 = T2 * 1.0023397.

So, T1/T2 ≈ 1.0023397.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (1.0023397)^4.

Compute this:

First, compute (1.0023397)^2.

(1.0023397)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0023397) + (0.0023397)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046794 + 0.000005476 ≈ 1.004684876.

Then, square that result:

(1.004684876)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.004684876) + (0.004684876)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00936975 + (0.00002193) ≈ 1.00939168.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00939168.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00939168 = 2.25 * 1.00939168 ≈ ?

2.25 * 1.00939168 = 2.25 * (1 + 0.00939168) = 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.00939168)

Compute 2.25 * 0.00939168:

0.00939168 * 2 = 0.01878336.

0.00939168 * 0.25 = 0.00234792.

Total = 0.01878336 + 0.00234792 = 0.02113128.

So, 2.25 + 0.02113128 ≈ 2.27113128.

So, approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is closest to option B (~2.32), but wait, that's not very close. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, which the problem states are the same (λ1_obs = λ2_obs). So, we can write:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Set them equal:

b/(T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is what I had before.

So, I think the calculation is correct. Thus, L1/L2 should be approximately 2.27.

But the options don't have 2.27. The closest is option B: ~2.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Doppler shift. Let me recheck that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact Doppler shift without approximations.

Compute beta = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.0023372.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1.0023372)/(0.9976628).

Let me compute this numerically.

1.0023372 ÷ 0.9976628.

Compute:

0.9976628 * 1.004678 = Let's see: 0.9976628 * 1.004678 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute this using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, let me compute it using cross multiplication.

Let me compute (1.0023372) / (0.9976628) = ?

Let me write this as (1002337.2 / 1e6) / (997662.8 / 1e6) ) = 1002337.2 / 997662.8.

Compute 1002337.2 ÷ 997662.8.

So,

997662.8 * 1.0047 ≈ ?

Well, 997,662.8 * 1 = 997,662.8

Multiply by 1.0047: 997,662.8 * 0.0047 ≈ 4,688.315.

So, 997,662.8 * 1.0047 ≈ 997,662.8 + 4,688.315 ≈ 1,002,351.115.

Which is very close to 1,002,337.2. So, 1.0047 gives 1,002,351.1, which is a bit higher than 1,002,337.2. Let me compute 1.0047 - delta.

Let me compute 997662.8 * x = 1,002,337.2.

So x = 1,002,337.2 / 997,662.8 ≈ approximately 1.004694.

Because 997662.8 * 1.004694 ≈ 997662.8 * (1 + 0.004694) = 997662.8 + 997662.8 * 0.004694.

Compute 997662.8 * 0.004694.

Calculate:

997662.8 * 0.004 = 3,990.6512.

997662.8 * 0.000694= Let's compute 997,662.8 * 6e-4 = 997,662.8 * 0.0006 = 598.59768.

Wait, no: 0.000694 = 6.94e-4.

So 997,662.8 * 6.94e-4 = 997,662.8 * 0.000694.

Compute:

997,662.8 * 0.0006 = 598.59768

997,662.8 * 0.000094 = 

Compute 997,662.8 * 0.0001 = 99.76628.

Multiply by 0.94: 99.76628 *0.94 = approx 93.77207.

So 598.59768 + 93.77207 = 692.36975.

So total 997,662.8 * 0.004694 ≈ 3,990.6512 + 692.36975 ≈ 4,683.02095.

So,

997,662.8 * 1.004694 ≈ 997,662.8 + 4,683.02095 ≈ 1,002,345.82.

But our target is 1,002,337.2, which is about 8.62 less than 1,002,345.82.

So, let me adjust x downward.

Each 1e-5 decrease in x would decrease the product by approximately 997,662.8 * 1e-5 ≈ 9.976628.

So, to decrease by ~8.62, x ≈ 1.004694 - (8.62/9.976628) ≈ 1.004694 - 0.864e-3 ≈ 1.0046076.

So, x ≈ 1.0046076.

Thus, (1.0023372)/(0.9976628) ≈ 1.0046076.

So, sqrt(1.0046076) is sqrt(1.0046076).

Compute sqrt(1.0046076).

Again, using the expansion sqrt(1 + a) ≈ 1 + a/2 - a²/8.

a = 0.0046076.

a/2 = 0.0023038.

a²/8 = (0.0046076)^2 /8 = (0.00002122) /8 ≈ 0.0000026525.

So,

sqrt ≈ 1 + 0.0023038 - 0.0000026525 ≈ 1.00230115.

So, T1 = T2 * 1.00230115.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00230115)^4.

Compute (1.00230115)^2 first.

(1.00230115)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00230115) + (0.00230115)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046023 + 0.000005295 ≈ 1.0046076.

Then, square that result to get the fourth power.

(1.0046076)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0046076) + (0.0046076)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0092152 + 0.00002122 ≈ 1.0092364.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0092364.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.0092364 = 2.25 * 1.0092364 ≈ ?

2.25 * 1.0092364 = 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.0092364).

Compute 2.25 * 0.0092364 ≈ 0.0207321.

So, 2.25 + 0.0207321 ≈ 2.2707321.

So, approximately 2.2707.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option B: ~2.32.

Wait, but 2.27 is closer to option D (~2.23) than to option B. Hmm, but option D is 2.23, which is about 0.04 less than 2.27, and option B is 0.05 higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering the Doppler shift correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature? Or maybe I should think of the luminosity formula in terms of the observed quantities.

Wait, no, because the stars emit as black bodies. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift, but the intrinsic temperature is what's in the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, I think the mistake might be in the initial assumption that T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ). Let me recheck that.

The observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is positive when the star is moving towards us. So if the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, then:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Since λ_rest = b / T, then:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is what I had before. So the earlier calculation seems correct.

So, perhaps the options are approximate, and the correct answer is approximately 2.27, which isn't one of the options, but maybe I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Doppler shift is different.

Alternative approach: For non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift for wavelength is approximated as:

λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c )

Wait, but wait, when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ' = λ (1 - v/c ), because the observed frequency increases.

Hmm, no, I think the correct formula for non-relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is:

λ' = λ (1 + v/c )

Wait, no, wait: if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so λ' = λ ( (c - v)/c ) = λ (1 - v/c )

Ah, yes, that's correct.

So, in that case, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (c - v) / c ) = λ_rest (1 - v/c )

So, for Star 2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 - v2/c )

Star 1 has v1=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Set λ1_obs = λ2_obs:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 - v2/c )

But λ_rest = b / T, so,

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 - v2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 - v2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c )

But v2 = 700 km/s. c is ~3e5 km/s, so v2/c = 700/3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - 0.002333 ) = T2 / 0.997667 ≈ T2 * 1.002337.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So,

T1 = T2 * 1.002337.

So, the ratio T1/T2 is 1.002337.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.002337)^4.

As before, this is approximately 1.00938.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.271.

So, the calculation remains the same.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option B (~2.32), but that's 0.05 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity. Because when a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, which makes the star appear hotter, thus with higher luminosity? Or does it affect the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is based on the star's intrinsic properties, not the observed ones. The observed flux F is given by F = L/(4πd²), but that's a different matter. But in this problem, the luminosity is calculated based on the star's intrinsic properties, so we don't need to adjust for distance or Doppler shift in that calculation.

Wait, but wait, the question states: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, the calculation is based on their intrinsic properties. So, the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but the luminosity is intrinsic. So, in that case, the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity. Hmm, but in the problem, the astronomers determined the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest, and found they were the same. So, they must have used the observed λ_max to infer their temperatures.

Ah, so perhaps the issue is that the observed λ_max is the same, but their actual λ_max (intrinsic) are different because of Doppler shift. Then, when calculating luminosity, they used the observed λ_max, which would give incorrect T values. Or maybe they used the intrinsic λ_max, but that depends.

Wait, the problem says: "the astronomers [...] determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but their actual (intrinsic) λ_max could be different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, but when you observe a star moving towards you, its emitted wavelength is blueshifted. So, to have the same observed λ_max, their intrinsic λ_max must differ.

So, when they calculated the luminosity, did they use the observed λ_max (which is the same for both stars) or the intrinsic λ_max, which are different?

Wait, the problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, assuming that the stars are blackbody emitters, the luminosity can be computed if you know R and T. But without knowing T, they would have to determine T from the observed λ_max.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is (intrinsic λ_max) * (1 - v/c), as per the Doppler shift. So, the observed λ_max is shorter than the intrinsic λ_max.

But since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, say λ_obs, then:

For Star 1: λ_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star 2: λ_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c ).

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c )

Which simplifies to:

T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c )

Which is the same equation as before. So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T2 * 1.002337.

So, the earlier calculation holds.

Thus, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1.002337)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.27.

So, the factor is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have this. The closest option is B) ~2.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.002337)^4. Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute (1.002337)^2:

1.002337 * 1.002337.

= (1 + 0.002337)^2

= 1 + 2(0.002337) + (0.002337)^2

= 1 + 0.004674 + 0.00000546

= 1.00467946.

Then, (1.00467946)^2:

= (1.00467946)^2 

= 1 + 2*(0.00467946) + (0.00467946)^2

= 1 + 0.00935892 + 0.00002189

= 1.00938081.

So, (1.002337)^4 ≈ 1.00938081.

Thus, 2.25 * 1.00938081 = 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.00938081).

Compute 2.25 * 0.00938081 = 0.0211059.

So, 2.25 + 0.0211059 ≈ 2.2711059.

Approximately 2.271, which is about 2.27.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach didn't consider the Doppler shift, and just used T1 = T2, which would give L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 (option A).

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if the stars are moving, their intrinsic temperatures must be different, which would affect the luminosity.

Hmm, but why isn't option A the answer? Because the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, which implies T1 ≠ T2.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars' temperatures are the same because their observed wavelengths are the same. So, T1 = T2, and L is proportional to R². Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 (option A).

But that seems to ignore the Doppler shift. So, perhaps the Doppler shift is negligible, and the factor is 2.25. But the velocity is 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% of the speed of light. So, the effect on T is about 0.23%, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.27, which is a small increase from 2.25.

But the options don't have 2.27. So perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~2.25, considering that the Doppler shift is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the stars have the same temperature, so L is simply (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times.

But I'm a bit confused here. The problem says that the observed λ_max are the same, which would require T1 and T2 to be different unless their velocities compensate. So, the initial approach is correct, but perhaps the options are approximate.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close to 2.25 * 0.995, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler shift because it's negligible. So, the stars have the same temperature, leading to L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 (option A).

But the problem explicitly gives the radial velocities, so I think it's intended to include the Doppler effect in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem didn't intend to include the Doppler shift effect, and the correct factor is 2.25, so option A.

But the problem does give the velocities, so probably the intended approach includes the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value without any approximations.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) where beta = 700/299792:

beta = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.0023372.

So,

(1 + beta) = 1.0023372.

(1 - beta) = 0.9976628.

(1.0023372)/(0.9976628) ≈ 1.004678.

So, sqrt(1.004678) ≈ 1.002338.

Thus, T1 = T2 * 1.002338.

Compute (T1/T2)^4 = (1.002338)^4.

Compute (1.002338)^2 = 1.004679.

(1.004679)^2 = 1.00938.

So, 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.271.

So, the factor is approximately 2.27. None of the options match exactly.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, option B is 2.32, which is 2.32/2.27 ≈ 1.021 times higher. Not a big difference, but perhaps the exact calculation would be slightly higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the Doppler effect correctly, leading to approximately 2.27, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculation once again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.002337)^4 more accurately.

Compute (1.002337)^4:

First, compute (1.002337)^2:

= 1.002337 * 1.002337.

= 1 + 2*(0.002337) + (0.002337)^2.

= 1 + 0.004674 + 0.00000546.

= 1.00467946.

Then, (1.00467946)^2:

= 1.00467946 * 1.00467946.

= (1 + 0.00467946)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.00467946) + (0.00467946)^2.

= 1 + 0.00935892 + 0.00002189.

= 1.00938081.

So, (1.002337)^4 = 1.00938081.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00938081 ≈ 2.271.

So, 2.271 is approximately 2.27.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option B) ~2.32.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the answer to be option B) ~2.32. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, not the luminosity. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, whereas flux depends on distance and Doppler shift. But the problem states that the luminosity is computed based on blackbody radiation, which depends on R and T. So, perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation, only the observed wavelength, which is used to find T.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, for the same observed wavelength, the intrinsic T must be different, leading to different luminosities.

But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift effect and assume T is the same, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that would be incorrect because the problem gives the velocities and mentions the observed wavelengths are the same. So, I think the intended approach includes the Doppler shift.

But without the exact options, I'm a bit stuck. Among the options given, 2.27 is closest to option B) 2.32, but that's still a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the Doppler shift is negligible, so T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25 (option A). But I'm not sure.

I'm going to conclude that the correct approach includes the Doppler shift, leading to a factor of approximately 2.27, but since that's not an option, the closest is option B) ~2.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Astronomers are analyzing two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, where Star_1 has a radius and mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that their observed peak wavelengths (λ_max) are identical. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity of a star is proportional to \( L \propto R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Observed Wavelengths and Temperature**:
   - The observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is related to the intrinsic wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) by the Doppler shift formula:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
     \]
     where \( v \) is the radial velocity and \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - For Star_1, \( v_1 = 0 \), so \( \lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T_1} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant.
   - For Star_2, \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so:
     \[
     \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
     \]
   - Since \( \lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \), equating the two expressions gives:
     \[
     \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
     \]
     Solving for \( T_1/T_2 \):
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
     \]

2. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
     \[
     \beta = \frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002337
     \]
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002337}{1 - 0.002337}} \approx \sqrt{1.004674} \approx 1.002337
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity ratio is given by:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1/R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1/T_2 \approx 1.002337 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (1.002337)^4
     \]
   - Compute \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \) and \( (1.002337)^4 \approx 1.00938 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 1.00938 \approx 2.271
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated factor \( \approx 2.27 \) is closest to option **B) ~2.32**, though slightly lower. Options **A (2.25)** and **D (2.23)** are too low, and option **C (2.35)** is too high.

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2 is approximately \( 2.27 \), which aligns most closely with option **B) ~2.32**.

**Answer: B**
