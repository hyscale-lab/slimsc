Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. Let me break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the structure. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring. On carbon 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1 (let's say the top carbon), there's a methyl group attached, but that methyl has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So, it's like a cyclohexyl attached to a CH2OH group, and then that's connected to the main cyclohexane ring. Also, the same carbon has a carbonyl group (aldehyde), making it a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So the target is a bicyclic structure? Or maybe it's a single ring with substituents. Hmm, perhaps the aldehyde is on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, and the same methyl also has a cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where Carbon 1 has a CH group attached. That CH group is connected to a cyclohexane (cyclohexyl), a hydroxyl (OH), and a methyl group (from the aldehyde). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl. So, the central carbon is attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group, and the aldehyde (CHO) group. Wait, but the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the substituent is a cyclohexyl-hydroxy-methyl group attached to the cyclohexane's carbon 1, and then the same carbon has a carbonyl (aldehyde) group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of functional groups. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached, so it's a terminal alkyne: HC≡C- attached to the cyclohexane).

We need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to that target molecule. Let's think about the transformations needed.

First, ethynylcyclohexane. So, I have a cyclohexane with a triple bond. Let me think about possible reactions. One common reaction for alkynes is hydration. Using H2SO4 and HgSO4 (hydration of alkynes to ketones). But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. When I hydrate an alkyne, I can get either a ketone (if it's a terminal alkyne) or a diketone. For a terminal alkyne like HC≡C-R, hydration would give R-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait, no. Wait, hydration of an alkyne typically adds water across the triple bond. For a terminal alkyne, H2O adds in such a way that the more substituted carbocation is formed. So, H2O adds to the triple bond, the H adds to the sp-hybridized carbon, and the O to the other. So for HC≡C-R, hydration gives R-C(OH)CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, I think the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give a ketone. Because the triple bond is between two carbons, and upon hydration, it becomes a carbonyl. So, the product would be cyclohexylaceton? Wait, more accurately, adding water across the triple bond would convert HC≡C-Cyclohexane into CH2(OH)-Cyclohexane. No, wait, adding water to the triple bond would give a carbonyl. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (HC≡C-). Hydration of an alkyne (using HgSO4 and H2SO4) would convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group. For a terminal alkyne, it would become a ketone. Wait, no, because the terminal alkyne has the triple bond at the end. So HC≡C-R would become R-CO after hydration. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylacetone? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is R-C≡C-CH2... Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-Cyclohexane connected to a triple bond. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C-, but as a substituent, it would be CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane?

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is a two-carbon alkyne substituent. So the structure is Cy (cyclohexyl)-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it Cy-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡C-CH3? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. That is, the cyclohexane is connected to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon, which is connected to a hydrogen. Wait, no, ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡CH? No, ethynyl is like -CH2-C≡CH? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it as: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a ethynyl group, which is the group -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2 group attached to a C≡CH. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's cyclohexane connected to a CH2-C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at one carbon, which is a CH2-C≡CH group. So, the substituent is an ethynyl group (the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH). So, the structure is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (cyclohexyl)ethyne, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond). So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, that's the starting material.

Now, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break that down. The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Then, that same carbon also has a carbaldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to the cyclohexane ring. That CH has three substituents: a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a methyl group with a carbonyl (CHO). Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and a carbonyl. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring where carbon 1 has a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group, which is also attached to a cyclohexyl group. And on that same carbon, there's an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of functional groups and the steps needed to reach the target.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group. So, the plan is to modify this group into the substituent we need.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to the main ring and also has an aldehyde group.

Hmm. Let me think about possible reactions.

First, maybe the alkyne can be converted into something else. One common reaction is hydration to form a ketone. So, adding H2O across the triple bond would give a ketone. So, if I have CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane, adding water would give CH2-C(OH)-CH2-OH? No, wait. Wait, no, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-R) gives R-C(OH)-CH2-OH? Or does it form a ketone?

Wait, no. The hydration of a terminal alkyne in the presence of H2SO4 and HgSO4 is called oxymercuration. It adds water across the triple bond in a way that the more substituted carbon gets the OH group. So, for HC≡C-R, the triple bond is between the R and the CH. So, when HgSO4/H2SO4 and H2O are added, the triple bond becomes a carbonyl. Wait, no, because for an alkyne to become a ketone, perhaps that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond becomes a ketone upon hydration. Let me think: ethyne (HC≡CH) upon hydration gives ketone (CH3COCH3) under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, ethyne hydration gives ethylene glycol? No, wait, no. Wait, ethyne when hydrated under acidic conditions (like HgSO4 and H2SO4) typically forms a ketone. For example, propyne (CH3-C≡CH) upon hydration gives acetone (CH3-C(O)-CH3). So, in our case, the starting material is (cyclohexyl)ethyne, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would add an OH group to the triple bond. So, the triple bond would become a carbonyl group. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)CH3? Wait, no, because the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. So, adding water would form cyclohexane-CH(OH)-COOH? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, actually, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethyne) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water would produce a ketone. For example, R-C≡CH → R-C(O)-CH3. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The triple bond is R-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, when we add H2SO4 and HgSO4, the triple bond would be converted into a carbonyl. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H. Wait, no, because the triple bond is between CH2 and the CH. Adding water would make the CH2 become a CO group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is at the end. So, starting with cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, after hydration, it would become cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-CH3. Because the triple bond (CH2-C≡CH) would become CH2-C(O)-CH3. So, the product is cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)CH3.

Wait, but that's a ketone. But the target molecule has an aldehyde group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe another approach: perhaps we can first do a reduction of the triple bond. Using H2 and a catalyst, like palladium, to reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, ethyne (C≡CH) upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would become CH2CH2, but in this case, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So, reducing it would give CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond adds two H's. So, CH2-C≡CH → CH2-CH2-CH2 after hydrogenation? No, wait, hydrogenation of the triple bond (C≡C) would become a single bond (C-C), adding two H's. So, CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-CH2-CH2 after hydrogenation? No, I think that's not correct. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond would add two Hs across each bond, so the triple bond (three bonds) becomes a single bond (one bond). So, for ethyne (HC≡CH), hydrogenation would produce ethane (CH2CH3). But in the case of CH2-C≡CH, hydrogenation would produce CH2-CH2-CH2? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: if I have ethynylcyclohexane and I want to form a more complex structure, maybe I should think about adding substituents via other reactions.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a Grignard reagent. But wait, typically, alkynes are less reactive towards Grignard conditions. Alternatively, maybe I can perform a reduction to form a trans-alkene, then do some addition.

Wait, the options given in the question involve various reagents. Let me look at the options.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reagents.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm. So, looking at the options, each has a sequence of reagents. Let's think about each step.

I think the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and we need to functionalize it to get the target molecule.

So, perhaps the steps involve adding a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to a main cyclohexane ring, along with an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Adding a methyl group via alkylation.
2. Reducing the triple bond to a single bond.
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
4. Hydrolysis or other reactions to form the necessary functional groups.

Alternatively, maybe using NaNH2 and methyl chloride for an alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. In the presence of methyl chloride, perhaps it's an alkylation reaction. So, maybe it's a method to add a methyl group.

Wait, NaNH2 is used as a base in alkylation reactions, especially in the formation of alkenes via elimination, or in the alkylation of aromatic rings. Alternatively, in the presence of methyl chloride, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction?

Alternatively, NaNH2 can deprotonate compounds to form strong bases. For example, in the formation of Grignard reagents, but with methyl chloride, perhaps it's a quenching step.

Wait, but in the presence of a triple bond, NaNH2 and methyl chloride might perform an alkyne alkylation. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Treating with NaNH2 and methyl chloride could add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, alkyne alkylation: in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the triple bond can undergo alkylation. For example, NaNH2 is a strong base. Adding methyl chloride would provide a methyl group. So, the ethynyl group (HC≡C-) could get a methyl group attached. Let me think: the triple bond is sp-hybridized, so perhaps the base deprotonates the triple bond, making it a better nucleophile, which then attacks the methyl chloride.

Wait, but in ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So, the sp-hybridized carbons are CH2 and CH. So, maybe the base abstracts a proton from the triple bond. The more acidic protons are on the sp-hybridized carbons. So, deprotonating would give a carbanion, which can attack the methyl chloride as an electrophile.

So, the triple bond would become CH2-C≡C-Me after alkylation. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-Me attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but in that case, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, next step.

Looking at the options, after alkylation, some options have H2/Pd (hydrogenation) or other steps.

Let me think about the possible steps.

Option A: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, after adding a methyl group to the triple bond, hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, making a single bond between the two carbons.

So, starting from CH2-C≡CH (as part of ethynylcyclohexane), after alkylation with methyl chloride, it becomes CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, so it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between two CH groups.

Wait, the initial structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation (H2, Pd) would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. So, that would be a butyl group attached to cyclohexane.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is alkylation, step 2 is hydrogenation to make a trans-alkene or a single bond.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to one end of the triple bond, making a propargyl group. Then, hydrogenation would make it a single bond, creating a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the alkylation isn't on the triple bond but elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the main ring. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.
3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond and form carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to form a diol or similar.

Wait, another approach: think about each option's steps.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Hmm. So, the first step could be deprotonation with NaNH2 and methanol. But methanol is a weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate things. Methanol is a solvent, perhaps.

Wait, another possibility: the first step could be a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step introduces a methyl group via alkylation, and the second step does a lithium amide reaction, which could be for forming enolates or alkynides.

Wait, perhaps going back to the target, the substituent at carbon 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group along with an aldehyde. So, this suggests that this substituent has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group that's also connected to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl-like group but with cyclohexyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is derived from a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents.

Looking at option C: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1 is alkylation with methyl chloride, probably adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

Step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd-CaCO3 (palladium on calcium carbonate), which would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two Hs across it.

So, after step 1 and 2: the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but that's a butyl group. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. But if the molecule doesn't have a double bond at that step, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Because hydrogenation using H2 and Pd could reduce a triple bond to a cis double bond if partial hydrogenation is done, but generally, H2 and Pd would reduce to a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is in a different condition. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is selective. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is transformed into a trans double bond via some other process. For example, using Li and NH3 (lithium amide) could cause deprotonation and elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each option's steps in more detail.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a solvent. Maybe it's a deprotonation or a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's usually done with ammonia and a metal like Na or Li.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is quenching the alkyne. Wait, but without knowing exactly, it's hard.

Another approach: think about the target molecule's functional groups. It has an aldehyde, a hydroxyl, and a cyclohexyl group.

The starting material is an alkyne attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a carbonyl group, then further reactions to add substituents.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it, then ozonolyze to form a carbonyl, and then perform some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexanol group, then oxidizing it to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's sequence.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, adds methyl to triple bond.
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenation, reduces triple bond to single bond.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond. So, perhaps after step 2, there's a double bond. Wait, but if the triple bond is reduced to a single bond, then where is the double bond?

Alternative thought: maybe the hydrogenation step is not complete. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation, turning the triple bond into a double bond. But H2 with Pd typically reduces triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation is done under different conditions, like using a poisoned catalyst that stops at the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted to a trans-alkene via some reaction before hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation step (step 1 in all options except B and D) adds a methyl group. Then, hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

Wait, let's take option C: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-Me-cyclohexane. Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3, which reduces the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's a butyl group. Then, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. But in this case, after step 2, there's a single bond, so no double bond exists. So, perhaps ozonolysis isn't applicable here.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Another option: perhaps the sequence involves forming a ketone, then performing a reduction or oxidation.

Wait, perhaps step 3 in option C is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So, after step 2, the molecule must have a double bond. How?

Unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps step 1 is alkylation, step 2 is hydrogenation to form a double bond instead of a single bond.

But under normal conditions, H2 and a catalyst like Pd would reduce a triple bond to a single bond. To get a double bond, perhaps Lindlar's catalyst is used for hydrogenation, but that's for alkynes to cis double bonds. Without that, maybe the hydrogenation is partial.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is done under different conditions, like using a nickel catalyst and stopping at the alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is alkylation, then hydrogenation to a single bond, then some kind of elimination to form a double bond, but that's not in the options.

This is getting quite complicated. Let me think about the target again. The target has an aldehyde group, a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and all connected to the main ring.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation to reduce the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, but how?
3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but how would that work.

Let me take option C: step 1 is alkylation (adds methyl to triple bond), step 2 is H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond, step 3 is ozonolysis. But no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do much.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But that would require a double bond. So, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, not a single bond.

Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material undergoes alkylation to add a methyl group, then is subjected to hydrogenation to add H across the triple bond to form a cis double bond (using a catalyst like Lindlar's, but that's for alkynes). Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation forms a longer chain, then partial hydrogenation yields a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation to a single bond, a double bond is introduced elsewhere.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reagents in each option.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2, methanol. Methanol as a solvent? Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Maybe it's an alkylation, but with methanol as the methylating agent. But methanol is a poor methylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base used in elimination reactions. So perhaps the first step in option D is deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl lithium or similar, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne, making it more nucleophilic, which then reacts with something else. But the reagent is methanol, which is a weak acid, so perhaps it's a quenching step.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not certain.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group on the same carbon.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH group connected to:

- a cyclohexyl group,

- a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH),

- and a carbonyl group (CHO).

So, the substituent is CH(OH)(CHO)(cyclohexyl). But that's a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl-like group, but with a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(OH)CHO group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenation to reduce the triple bond to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves:

- Alkylation to add a substituent.

- Hydrogenation to form a double bond.

- Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

- Then, some reaction to add the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Partial hydrogenation to a double bond (like using H2 and a poisoned catalyst).

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not sure how the cyclohexyl group comes into play.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a longer chain with a double bond, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups. Then, Ba(OH)2 or another reagent could perform elimination or formation of the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule has two carbonyl groups, which can then be modified to form the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

This is getting too vague. Let me think of each option again.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq. NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

So, step 1: alkylation with ethyl chloride. So, the triple bond gets an ethyl group, making it a longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. Maybe this is for deprotonation, elimination, or forming a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is often used for deprotonation to form strong bases, perhaps leading to elimination reactions. So, maybe step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

So, after step 2, the alkyne becomes an alkene.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the alkene, which would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolysis to form acids or aldehydes.

So, putting it all together:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH).

Step 1: Alkylation with ethyl chloride → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → elimination to form a trans-alkene: cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-Et.

Wait, but the triple bond was between CH2 and C≡C-Et. Deprotonating and eliminating would form a double bond. So, maybe the product is cyclohexane-CH2-C=C-Et.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis → cleavage of the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would split into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But then, how does the cyclohexyl group attach? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis produces a diketone or dialdehyde.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Another thought: perhaps step 4 is a reductive workup (like with Zn/H2O) which would form aldehydes. But in option B, step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide. That would lead to oxidative cleavage, forming ketones or carboxylic acids depending on the substitution.

Wait, but ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S) gives aldehydes and ketones, whereas oxidative workup (like H2O2) gives carboxylic acids or ketones.

In option B, step 3 is O3/H2O, which is oxidative cleavage. So, the ozonide would break into two carboxylic acids or ketones.

Hmm. But the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the aldehyde is formed from a carbonyl group.

I'm not sure if option B is the right path.

Looking at option C again:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, adding methyl to triple bond: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → reduces triple bond to single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But no double bond, so no reaction. So, perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

I'm not sure about this one either.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, step 1: alkylation adds methyl to alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond.

So, structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones to form ketones with an oxygen insertion. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or in epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but Ba(OH)2 isn't typically used for that.

Hmm, perhaps step 3 is a hydroboration or something else.

Alternatively, maybe after step 2, the molecule has a longer chain, and Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination to form a double bond. For example, if there's an alcohol present, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination.

But without knowing the structure after step 2, it's hard to say.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which is the standard conditions for hydration of an alkyne. But if there's no alkyne left, perhaps this step is for something else, like acid-catalyzed hydration of a carbonyl or another group.

Hmm.

This is getting a bit too time-consuming. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The target has an aldehyde group. So, the sequence must include a step that forms an aldehyde from a carbonyl group, perhaps via ozonolysis followed by reductive workup.

Looking at the options, options B, C, and D involve ozonolysis steps.

Option B: O3/H2O (which is oxidative) followed by NH4OH (aqueous). That would likely produce carboxylic acids.

Option C: O3/(CH3)2S (reductive workup), which would produce aldehydes and ketones.

Option D: O3/(CH3)2S, then NH4OH. So, step 3 is reductive workup, step 4 is aqueous.

So, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to formation of aldehydes and ketones.

So, if after ozonolysis, the molecule has a carbonyl group that becomes the aldehyde, perhaps that's a step toward the target.

Let me think of option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → adds methyl to alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation → reduces triple bond to single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis → but without a double bond, this won't cleave. So, perhaps this is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the hydrogenation step. Maybe the hydrogenation is incomplete, leaving a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, the structure has a double bond.

Wait, no. Alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. No double bonds.

So, ozonolysis in step 3 would not react. Hmm. So, option C may not be the correct sequence.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl lithium.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. This is a strong base. Perhaps it's used for elimination or deprotonation to form a trans-alkene.

But I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol in step 1 is a quenching step, but without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne, and step 2 is forming a trans-alkene via elimination.

If after step 2, there's a trans-alkene, then ozonolysis in step 3 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Then, the workup step (NH4OH) would perhaps hydrolyze any protecting groups or form aldehydes/ketones.

But I'm still not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that option C is the correct sequence.

Wait, let me think again. The target has an aldehyde group, a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexyl, and all connected to the main cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to reduce the triple bond to a double bond (using H2 and a poisoned catalyst).

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyls. Then, the Ba(OH)2 step (option A and C) could form a cyclic structure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C: alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and Ba(OH)2.

But without a clear understanding, it's hard to conclude.

Alternatively, considering the presence of Ba(OH)2 in option A and C, which is often used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is also used in the Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic esters.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used in the oxidation of alcohols. If after step 3 in option C, there's a carbonyl group, Ba(OH)2 might not do much.

Hmm.

Another approach: think about the number of functional groups in the target. It has three: aldehyde, hydroxyl, and cyclohexyl.

The starting material is an alkyne attached to a cyclohexane.

Perhaps, the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration (which would be step 3 in option A, using H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O). Then, the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps some oxidation or alkylation.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via some kind of alkylation or elimination.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 step in option A is for epoxidation or for elimination to form a double bond. But I'm not certain.

This is taking too long. I think I'll have to go with option C as the correct sequence, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond, forming a longer chain.  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is typically used for oxidation or elimination, but its role here is unclear.  
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O hydrates alkynes to ketones, but no alkyne remains after step 2.  
   - This sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, adding an ethyl group.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ likely eliminates a proton to form a double bond.  
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O oxidatively cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH hydrolyzes the ozonide, but this sequence does not explain how the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxymethyl group is introduced.  

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond, forming a longer chain.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds into aldehydes and ketones, but no double bond exists after step 2, making this step ineffective.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is unclear in its role here.  
   - This sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol may deprotonate or alkylate the alkyne, but the role of methanol is unclear.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ likely eliminates a proton to form a double bond.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond into aldehydes and ketones.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH hydrolyzes the ozonide, but this sequence does not explain how the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxymethyl group is introduced.  

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite uncertainties in the exact transformations.
