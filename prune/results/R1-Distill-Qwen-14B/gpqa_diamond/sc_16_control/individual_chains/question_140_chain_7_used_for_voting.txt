Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit lost, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The problem says: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. So, let's break this down. I think I should start by identifying what each of these substances could be.

First, the reaction with liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like water? Because some metals react violently with water. For example, sodium or potassium. Wait, but sodium reacts with water, but not as violently as some others. Maybe a group 1 metal?

But wait, the gas W is released. If X is a metal reacting with water, the gas would be hydrogen. Let me think about hydrogen's structure. Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for H2, each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So in a molecule, 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That doesn't match. So maybe it's not hydrogen.

Wait, another gas could be ammonia, but ammonia doesn't come from such a reaction. Alternatively, maybe something like CO2? Let's see: CO2 has 1 C and 2 O's. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (carbon-12), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (oxygen-16). So each CO2 molecule has (6+16*2) protons: 6 + 32 = 38 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 2*(8) = 22. Oh wait, that's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is something like NH3 (ammonia). NH3 has 1 N and 3 H's. Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So the molecule has 7 + 3(1) = 10 protons and 7 + 3(0) =7 neutrons. That's not equal. Not matching.

Wait, what about CH4? No, that's a gas, but again, the protons and neutrons would be different. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like O2 or O3. Let's see: O2 has 16*2 =32. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each O2 molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16 each. That works. So W could be O2. But wait, oxygen is produced when something like a metal peroxide reacts with water? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G forms, which upon heating gives B. B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point near there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no, melting point of NH4Cl is around 337 K, which is higher. Wait, perhaps B is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, its melting point is much higher.

Wait, another thought: if X is sodium, then reacting with water (Y) would produce sodium hydroxide, hydrogen gas, and maybe some precipitate? Wait, sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2 gas. But what precipitate would form? Oh wait, maybe if Y is something else. Maybe Y isn't water. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Wait, but the question says it's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, magnesium with sulfuric acid. But I'm not sure about the gas and precipitate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a solution that produces a precipitate. Like lead nitrate solution and something else.

Wait, let's think about the gas W. The molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, protons = neutrons. So for example, if it's a diatomic molecule like O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each O atom contributes 8 p and 8 n. So two O atoms would give 16 p and 16 n per molecule. So that fits: protons = neutrons =16 each.

Wait, but O2 is O-O, but is O a heavy isotope? Because the problem says Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is something like H2O that includes a heavy isotope, but wait H2O is a liquid, but Y is a liquid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something like D2 (deuterium), but that's not a common gas. Or maybe a molecule like CH3NH2 (methylamine), but that's probably not right.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. If X is a metal and Y is water, then the reaction would produce a metal oxide or hydroxide, and hydrogen gas. So for example, Mg + 2H2O → Mg(OH)2 + H2↑. But in that case, the gas is H2, which doesn't fit the W condition. So that might not be the case.

Wait, but perhaps X is a metal that when reacts with water produces a different gas. For example, if X is a metal that reacts with cold water to produce hydrogen, but maybe if X is more reactive, like potassium? No, same result.

Hmm, maybe Y isn't water but another liquid. Let's think about other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfuric acid. But then X might be a metal, which would produce SO2 or H2 gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Upon heating, G releases B. What if G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. But then B would be the oxide. Alternatively, maybe G is something like a hydroxide which upon heating becomes an oxide. Wait, for example, if X is a metal that reacts with a solution of something to form a hydroxide precipitate, which when heated becomes an oxide.

Wait, but the melting point of B is near 277 K. Let's calculate what that is in Celsius: 277 K is 4°C (since 273 K is 0°C). So B is a solid at 4°C, but perhaps it's a solid that doesn't melt much above that. Hmm. Common substances with low melting points include things like iodine (melting point about 113°C), or maybe something like camphor, but that's not a compound I'm thinking of here.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, it has a high melting point. Wait, what about something like ammonium nitrate? Its melting point is around 169°C, which is higher than 277 K. Hmm, maybe I'm going in the wrong direction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like water ice. Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), but the melting point is 273 K. Wait, the problem says the melting point is very close to 277 K, which is around 4°C. So maybe B is a solid that melts at 4°C. Hmm, maybe paraffin wax? No, that's not a pure substance. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a very pure form of a substance.

Wait, perhaps B is something like a hydrate. For example, maybe it's a metal hydroxide that is hydrated. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe we should think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think: a keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has a keto group. When X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 O atoms. So perhaps X is something that can dehydrate the acid. For example, if X is a strong acid, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. If X is something like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), then when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's an esterification or some condensation reaction? Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base. If X is a strong base like NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce a salt and water. But the product would have more than two oxygen atoms, I think. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction with a keto acid produces a carboxylic acid salt. For example, Mg reacting with acetic acid would produce Mg acetate. But that product has more than two oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an oxidation. If X is a halogen, like Cl2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is used in organic reactions. Wait, the problem says X and especially its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. NaBH4 is a common reducing agent, so that's a possibility.

Wait, if X is NaBH4, then let's see. NaBH4 reacts with water (Y) to produce H2 gas (W), and the precipitate could be NaBH(OH)2 or something. Wait, but when NaBH4 reacts with water, it's a slow reaction, but under certain conditions, it can be vigorous. Alternatively, if Y is a different liquid.

But the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let's think: if G is NaBH(OH)2, heating it might produce NaBO2 and release H2. But I'm not sure. Also, the melting point of B being around 4°C. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. So, let's consider possible gases that fit this.

Let's think of molecules where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.

For example, H2: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So per molecule, 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit.

Oxygen (O2): each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming O-16). So per O2 molecule: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So yes, equal. So W could be O2.

But O2 is produced from what kind of reaction? Maybe the decomposition of a peroxide. For example, 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. But that's if Y is H2O2 and X is a catalyst, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is sodium peroxide (Na2O2). When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces O2 gas. So the reaction is 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

So in this case, W is O2, which fits the condition of protons equal to neutrons per molecule.

Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is a strong base and soluble in water, so that wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps X is another peroxide, like BaO2. When BaO2 reacts with water, it produces O2 and Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but its solubility varies. At higher concentrations, perhaps a precipitate forms?

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Let's say Y is H2SO4, and X is a peroxide. Then the reaction could be something else. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2O2 itself. Then Y could be a catalyst, but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the precipitate G is a carbonate. For example, if X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid. But that doesn't fit with the initial reaction producing O2.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide. So X is a metal, Y is an acid, reaction produces a metal hydroxide which precipitates. Then heating the hydroxide gives the metal oxide.

Wait, if X is a metal, let's say magnesium, reacting with an acid (like HCl) to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and perhaps no precipitate. Hmm, unless it's a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between sodium and water, producing NaOH and H2. But NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a ketone? Because a keto acid (like acetic acid) when decarboxylated would produce a ketone and CO2. But the product has 2 O's, so perhaps it's a ketone with two O's. For example, acetone has three O's, but maybe another ketone.

Wait, acetic acid (CH3COOH) when decarboxylated would lose CO2 and form CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that's an alcohol. Alternatively, if it's a different reaction, like oxidation.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4. When KMnO4 reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it oxidizes it. But I'm not sure what product that would have two oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, maybe X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which can act as a dehydrating agent. When it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it causes dehydration to form an anhydride. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, going back to the gas W. If W is O2, then the reaction producing O2. So X is a peroxide, perhaps. So X could be Na2O2, which when reacts with water produces O2.

So the reaction is:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

In this case, Y is water, which is a liquid. So that fits.

Then, the precipitate G could be NaOH, but that's soluble. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a different compound. Maybe if X is a peroxide that reacts with another liquid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another solution, like a salt solution.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with peroxide to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2 and X is Na2O2, the reaction could produce BaO2 and other products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when X reacts with Y (water), it produces a hydroxide which doesn't dissolve, forming a precipitate. For example, if X is a peroxide of a metal that forms an insoluble hydroxide. But I'm not sure which metal that would be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate. For example, if X is sodium carbonate and Y is an acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Let's think about the heating part. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So maybe B is a solid that doesn't melt until 4°C.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's assume X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is PCl5, which can dehydrate a carboxylic acid to form an anhydride. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if X is H2SO4, which is a strong acid and can act as a dehydrating agent.

Wait, if X is H2SO4, then reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid would dehydrate it to form anhydrides. For example, acetic anhydride, which has the formula (CH3CO)2O. This molecule has two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, acetic anhydride has two carbonyl groups. Let me count the O's: each acetic acid is CH3COOH, and when two of them lose a water molecule, they form (CH3CO)2O, which has O's: 2 from each acid minus 1 water O, so 2*(2) -1=3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For example, acetic acid and an alcohol would form an ester, but that would require X to be an alcohol, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction with a keto acid produces a salt. For example, magnesium reacting with acetic acid to form Mg acetate. But Mg acetate has more than two oxygen atoms, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. For example, if X is a reducing agent like NaBH4, and the keto acid is something that can be reduced. Wait, NaBH4 typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. So maybe if the keto acid is something like propanone (acetone), but that's not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. I'm not making progress on this part.

Let me think about the information given again. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, perhaps X has an element with a heavier isotope, like deuterium. For example, if X is H2O, but that's not a heavy isotope. Or if X is a compound containing something like D2O (heavy water). But the reaction with Y (water) would produce something else.

Wait, but if X is a metal, perhaps it's a heavy isotope. For example, perhaps X is potassium, which has a heavier isotope than sodium.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should consider the options given. The options are the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Let's look at the options: A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. These sums suggest combinations of elements. Let's think about possible elements.

Looking at 25: maybe 12 (carbon) +13 (aluminum)? No, 12+13=25. Or 1 (hydrogen) +24 (magnesium) =25. But magnesium's atomic number is 12, so mass is about 24.3, so 1+24.3≈25.3. Close enough.

Another option for 35: maybe 16 (oxygen) +19 (potassium) =35. Or 15 (phosphorus) + 20 (calcium) = 35. Or 14 (nitrogen) +21 (scandium) =35. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says if multiple instances of an element exist, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. So, for X, all isotopes of each element present are summed.

Wait, but if X is a diatomic molecule, like H2, then each hydrogen atom is either protium (¹H) or deuterium (²H). So the sum would be (1 + 2) for each H, multiplied by the number of H atoms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about X being a metal with a heavy isotope. For example, if X is sodium (23), but maybe it's the heavier isotope, say ²⁵Na. But sodium is primarily ²³Na. So if X is sodium and incorporates a heavier isotope, maybe it's a mixture. But the sum would be considering all isotopes present.

Alternatively, if X is a compound, like Na2O2. The elements are Na and O. So sum their isotopes.

But perhaps X is H2O, but with a heavier isotope, like D2O (deuterium oxide). So, in that case, the elements are H and O.

Wait, but if X is H2O, then when it reacts with another liquid Y, perhaps water, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another compound.

Wait, but going back to the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W (which could be O2), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with a melting point near 4°C.

Another approach: Let's consider that B is a solid that melts around 4°C. What could that be? Maybe a type of salt that has a low melting point. Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point of about 169°C, which is higher. Or maybe something like sodium nitrate? No, that's higher.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate has a melting point around 29°C. That's close to 277 K (which is about 4°C). Wait, 277 K is 4°C, but 29°C is 302 K. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe B is a metal. For example, mercury has a melting point of -39°C, which is way below. Gallium melts around 29°C, so about 302 K. Close to 277 K (4°C) but not exact.

Wait, perhaps B is something like a very pure substance. Alternatively, maybe it's a type of ice, but that's not a compound.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the possible identity of X.

So, if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, then reacting with water (Y) produces O2 gas (W), and NaOH solution. But NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate unless perhaps in excess. Alternatively, if Y is a solution that can form a precipitate with NaOH. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal nitrate that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, and X is Na2O2. Then, when Na2O2 reacts with Ba(NO3)2, perhaps BaO2 precipitates. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Let me think about the equation:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

So if Y is water, then the products are NaOH and O2. But NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate. So maybe Y isn't water. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing another ion that forms an insoluble hydroxide with NaOH.

Wait, if Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, like Cu(NO3)2, then when NaOH is added, it forms a precipitate of Cu(OH)2. So in that case, the precipitate G would be Cu(OH)2. Then, upon heating, it would decompose into CuO and water. So B would be CuO. The melting point of CuO is around 1400°C, which is much higher than 4°C. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate. For example, if Y is a carbonate solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's say X is a halogen, like Cl2. Reacting Cl2 with a keto acid might not make sense. Or if X is a base like NaOH, reacting with a keto acid would produce a salt and water. The product would have more than two O's, I think.

Wait, maybe X is something like carbon dioxide. But then it's a gas, not a solid or liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it displaces the acid's H, forming a salt. For example, Mg with acetic acid forms Mg acetate. Mg acetate has formula Mg(CH3COO)2. Each acetate has two O's, but the whole molecule would have more than two.

Wait, perhaps the product is a metal carbonate. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an esterification. But that typically involves an acid and an alcohol, not a metal.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So which elements sum to these numbers.

Let me think: option B is 25. What elements add up to 25.

Hydrogen (1) + Manganese (55) → too big. Alternatively, Carbon (12) + Aluminum (27) → 39. No. Wait, 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25. No, 12+13=25? 12+13=25. Yes. So elements C and Al would sum to 25.

Another option: 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) → 25. H and Mg.

Option D is 29. 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) =29. Or 16 (O) +13 (Al)=29. Or 20 (Ca) +9 (F)=29.

Option C is 31. 15 (P) +16 (O)=31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl)=31.

Option A is 35. 16 (O) +19 (K)=35. Or 14 (N) +21 (Sc)=35.

Now, considering that X is a reagent in organic chemistry, perhaps it's something like KMnO4 (K is 39, Mn is 55; their sum would be 94, which isn't an option). Or maybe X is something like sodium borohydride, NaBH4. The elements are Na (23), B (11), H (1). Summing the lightest and heaviest elements: Na (23) and H (1) → 24. Not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the elements in X are Na and O. Na is 23, O is 16. Sum is 39, not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is sodium peroxide (Na2O2), the elements are Na and O. So their lightest and heaviest isotopes: Na has isotopes like 23Na and 25Na. Wait, no, Na's main isotope is 23Na. O has 16O, 17O, 18O. So the lightest element is O (16) and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 16 +23 =39, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal, like Mg. The lightest element is Mg (24.3) but that can't be split. Wait, Mg is a single element. So the sum would be Mg (24). But the options don't have 24.

Alternatively, X could be a compound with two different elements, like H2O. The elements are H and O. Their lightest masses: H is ~1, O is ~16. Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. Then only O is present, so sum would be O's mass. Not matching options.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with multiple elements. Let's think about the product with the keto acid. The product has 2 O atoms. So perhaps X is something that adds O's. Like an oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. If X is Na2CO3, reacting with a keto acid might produce CO2 and the corresponding salt. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let's try to think differently.

The melting point of B is near 277 K (4°C). What is a compound that melts around there? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate is not it, as it's higher. Maybe it's a type of salt that has a low melting point. Wait, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate has a melting point of about 33°C, which is higher.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 25°C, which is about 298 K, which is a bit off. But perhaps something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like camphor, which has a melting point around 177°C. No, that's way off.

Wait, maybe B is solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), which sublimates at -78°C, but that's way below 4°C.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Let me try to think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So perhaps the elements in X are two elements, and their lightest and heaviest isotopes sum to one of these numbers.

For example, if X is a compound containing C and O. C's lightest isotope is 12, O's is 16. Sum is 28. Not an option. Alternatively, if X has O and Na. O is 16, Na is 23. Sum is 39, not an option.

Another approach: perhaps X is a compound with elements that have the lightest and heaviest isotopes summing to one of the options. For example, X has H (1) and Cl (35). Sum is 36, which is close to option A (35), but not exactly.

Wait, but the problem says to sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. So, for each element, we sum all the isotopes present in X.

Wait, but if X contains H and O, for example, then H has isotopes 1H and 2H, O has 16O, 17O, 18O. So the sum for H would be 1 + 2 =3, and for O 16 +17 +18=51. So total would be 3 +51=54. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is Na2O2, then for Na: 23, and for O: 16, 17, 18. Sum Na: 23. Sum O: 16+17+18=51. So total sum is 23 +51=74. Not matching options.

Hmm. Another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's think of a product with two O's. Maybe a ketone like acetone has (CH3)2CO, which has three O's. Not two.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone with two O's. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule like formaldehyde (HCHO), which has one O. Not two.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diethyl ether, but that's not from a keto acid.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. For example, ethyl acetate has four O's. Not two.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid with two O's. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a carboxylic acid has at least two O's in the COOH group.

Wait, acetic acid has two O's in the COOH group. So maybe the product is acetic acid. But X is a reagent, so perhaps X is something like COCl2 (phosgene), which can react with a keto acid to form an acid chloride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, if X is NaBH4, and the reaction reduces a keto acid to an alcohol. The alcohol would have an -OH group, which has one O. But the product has two O's, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation. For example, heating a keto acid to lose CO2, forming a ketone. If the original keto acid has three O's (like acetic acid: CH3COOH has two O's in COOH and one O elsewhere?), wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH, which has two O's in the COOH group. So if it loses CO2, it would form CH3CH2OH (ethanol), which has one O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe the keto acid loses a water molecule to form an anhydride. For example, two acetic acids lose a water to form acetic anhydride, which has formula (CH3CO)2O. That molecule has two O's. So the product would have two O's.

So, X would be a dehydrating agent, like PCl5 or H2SO4. If X is H2SO4, which is a strong acid and can act as a dehydrating agent, then when it reacts with a keto acid like acetic acid, it could cause the formation of the anhydride.

So, product would be (CH3CO)2O, which has two O's. That fits the condition.

So, if X is H2SO4, then what's Substance X? Sulfuric acid.

Now, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

H2SO4 is composed of H, S, O.

Wait, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So, H is the lightest, and either S or O is the heaviest? Sulfur has an atomic mass around 32, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So, the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is S (32). Sum is 1 +32=33. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So 33 isn't among them. Hmm. Maybe X is another compound.

Wait, perhaps X is another dehydrating agent. Let me think of other possibilities.

If X is PCl5, then the elements are P and Cl. Lightest is P (about 31), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 31 +35.5=66.5, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: X is something like ZnCl2. Zn has a mass of about 65, Cl is 35.5. Sum would be 65 +35.5=100.5. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. Let's say X is Mg. Then, the only element is Mg, so the sum would be Mg's mass, which is 24.3, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is a diatomic molecule with two different elements, like CO. Then, C is 12, O is 16. Sum is 28. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is a compound with two elements, one being H and another being a heavier element.

Wait, perhaps X is H2O2. Then, elements are H and O. H is 1, O is 16. Sum is 17. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the reaction again. If X reacts with Y to release O2 gas, then X might be a peroxide, like Na2O2. So, elements in X are Na and O.

The lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 16 +23=39, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the lightest and heaviest isotopes of each element, but not the sum of their atomic masses. Wait, no, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses.

Wait, another angle: if X is a compound with elements lighter than O and heavier than S.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NaOH. Then, elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 1 +23=24, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So, perhaps the product is a ketone with two O's. Wait, but a ketone has a carbonyl group (C=O), which is one O. So maybe it's a di-ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a carboxylic acid with two O's. For example, formic acid (HCOOH) has two O's in the COOH group. But X would need to be a reagent that, when reacted with a keto acid, produces formic acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, if X is LiAlH4, which can reduce a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) to an alcohol. The alcohol would have one O. But the product needs two O's, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base. For example, if X is NH3, then reacting with a keto acid would form a salt and water. The product would be a ammonium salt, which has more O's, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm really not making progress here. Let me think about the options again. The correct answer is among 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements that sum to 25. The lightest element is 12 (C), the heaviest is 13 (Al), but 12+13=25. So option B is 25.

But what compound contains C and Al? Maybe something like AlCOOH (but that's not a real compound). Alternatively, maybe it's a complex like aluminum acetate, which contains Al, C, and O.

Wait, aluminum acetate is Al(CH3COO)3. So the elements are Al, C, O. The lightest is C (12), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 12 +27=39. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X contains C and O. C's atomic mass is 12, O is 16. Sum is 28, not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Looking at these, 25 could be C (12) and Al (13), but that's 25.

Alternatively, 25 could be H (1) and Mg (24), as 1+24=25.

So, if X contains H and Mg, then the sum would be 25. What is a reagent in organic chemistry that contains Mg and H? Maybe something like Mg in ether, used in Grignard reagents. Oh! Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like CH2MgBr.

Wait, wait! Grignard reagents are indeed used as reagents in organic chemistry. So if X is a Grignard reagent, like CH2MgBr, then the elements present are C, H, Mg, Br.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Br (80). Sum is 1 +80=81, which is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps X is magnesium itself, which is used as a reagent. So, if X is Mg metal, it's used in some reactions. The elements in Mg are just Mg. So the lightest and heaviest elements are both Mg. Sum is 24 +24=48, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like NaH, which is a strong base. NaH is used as a reagent. So elements are Na and H.

Na's atomic mass is about 23, H is 1. Sum is 24, not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product of X with a keto acid is not an organic compound but something else. For example, if X is a base like NaOH, and the keto acid is formic acid, the product would be sodium formate, which has formula HCOONa. This compound has two O's in the formate ion (HCOO-). So the product has two O's. So X could be NaOH. Then, what about the other parts of the reaction.

Wait, but if X is NaOH, then when it reacts with Y (maybe water?), it produces gas W. But NaOH is a strong base and reacts with water, but doesn't produce gas. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If I think the answer is D)29, which could be O (16) +13 (Al) =29. But I'm not sure what compound that would be.

Alternatively, 29 could be Cl (35.5) and something else. No, that's too big.

Wait, another approach: the product of X with a keto acid has two O's. So maybe the product is a molecule with two O's. Let's say the keto acid is something like propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH), which when reacted with X, forms something with two O's. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound that adds an O. For example, if X is O2, but that's a gas and doesn't fit the reagent description.

I think I've spent way too long on this and need to make a guess. The most plausible scenario is that X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, which reacts with water to produce O2. The precipitate could be NaOH, but that's soluble. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a different compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. When it reacts with acid, it produces CO2 gas. So W would be CO2, which has 22 protons (12 C + 16 O *2= 44 protons?) Wait, no. The molecule CO2 has 12 (C) + 16 (O) *2 = 12+32=44 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 8*2=22 neutrons. Doesn't match.

Wait, but no, the problem says the gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for CO2, 44 protons, 22 neutrons. Not equal. So not CO2.

Hmm, this is really tough. I think I'll have to conclude based on the options and the reagent aspect.

If X is a Grignard reagent (like CH2MgBr), then the elements are C, H, Mg, Br. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Br (80). Sum is 81. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is a metal like Mg, sum is 24.

Another thought: if X is a compound with elements C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum is 28, not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something like NH3. Then, elements are N and H. Sum is 14 +1=15. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3OH (methanol). Then elements are C, H, O. Sum lightest (H:1) and heaviest (C:12) →13. Not an option.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. Based on the product having two O's, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent like H2SO4. The elements are H, S, O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is S (32). Sum is 33, not an option. But the closest option is 35 (option A). Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, if X is H2SO4, then maybe considering the isotopes. S can have isotopes, like 32S (95.7% abundance), 34S (4.25%). So the sum for S would be 32 +34 =66. H's sum is 1 + 2 (if any D is present) =3. O's sum is 16 +17 +18=51. So total sum would be 3 +66 +51=120. Not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Maybe X is KMnO4. The elements are K, Mn, O. K is 39, Mn is 55, O is 16. Sum lightest (O:16) + heaviest (Mn:55)=71. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has two O's. So, perhaps X is a carbonyl group, but that's not a substance.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl chloride, like phosgene (COCl2). Reacting with a keto acid might not form a product with two O's.

I think I'm stuck and have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is D)29, which could be O (16) and Al (13), summing to 29. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B)25, which would be H (1) and Mg (24), sum 25.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent and the options, I'll go with option D)29.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (where W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons), forms a precipitate G, and upon heating, G releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and the task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be O₂, where each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making the molecule have 16 protons and 16 neutrons.

2. **Reaction with Y**: If Y is water, X could be a peroxide (e.g., Na₂O₂), which reacts with water to produce O₂ gas and NaOH. However, NaOH is soluble, so a precipitate G would require additional context.

3. **Precipitate G and B**: Upon heating, G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a low-melting solid, potentially a hydrated salt or a specific organic compound.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X could act as a dehydrating agent, such as H₂SO₄, which facilitates the formation of an anhydride (e.g., acetic anhydride, (CH₃CO)₂O).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Considering possible candidates:
   - If X is H₂SO₄, the elements are H, S, and O. The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is S (32). Their sum is 33, which is not an option.
   - If X is a Grignard reagent (e.g., CH₂MgBr), the elements are C, H, Mg, and Br. The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Br (80). Their sum is 81, which is also not an option.
   - If X is Na₂O₂, the elements are Na and O. The lightest element is O (16), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 39, which is not an option.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 35**: Could correspond to O (16) + K (19) or other combinations, but no clear match for X.
   - **B) 25**: Could correspond to H (1) + Mg (24) or C (12) + Al (13).
   - **C) 31**: Could correspond to P (31) + O (16), but no clear match for X.
   - **D) 29**: Could correspond to O (16) + Al (13) or other combinations.

Given the constraints and the options provided, the most plausible answer is **D) 29**, assuming X contains elements like O and Al.

Answer: D
