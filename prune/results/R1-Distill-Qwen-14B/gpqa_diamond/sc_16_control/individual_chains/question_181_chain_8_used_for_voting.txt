Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about the Sun's core reactions and how stopping a specific branch affects the neutrino flux we receive on Earth. The pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I think pp stands for proton-proton, right? And the III probably refers to the third branch or something in the proton-proton chain. Oh, wait, the proton-proton chain has a few branches. I remember that the pp-I and pp-II are the main ones, and pp-III is a minor branch. Or maybe it's the other way around—I should think about that.

The question is about the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, we need to find Flux(band1)/Flux(band2).

Wait, if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos would be affected? I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe not. Let me recall: the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos through the process where two protons fuse into deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. The main branch (pp-I) produces neutrinos with lower energies. The pp-II branch is maybe a different pathway, but I'm not too sure. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch might involve more steps, leading to higher-energy neutrinos. Or perhaps the branching affects the production rate of different neutrino energies.

Wait, no. Another thought: the main pp-I and pp-II produce 1 MeV neutrinos. But I'm a bit confused. Maybe the pp-III produces neutrinos with higher energy. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps the pp-III is the dominant branch and contributes a lot to the neutrino flux.

Wait, I should remember that the pp-I is the dominant branch, producing 70-80% of the Sun's neutrinos, and the pp-II produces about 20%, and pp-III is even less. So, if pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

So, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific bands. So, if the pp-III was stopped, which band's flux would be affected more?

I think the pp-III branch might be associated with producing higher-energy neutrinos. Wait, no, the neutrinos in the Sun's main pp chain are around 1 MeV, but there are also other processes like the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7, which produces lower-energy (around 0.38 MeV) neutrinos. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, let me think about the neutrino energies. The pp-III branch... I think that in the standard pp chain, each step produces a neutrino. The main pp-I process produces neutrinos when a proton captures a positron after the beta decay. The neutrino energy from the main branch is about 0.4 MeV. The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV. Wait, no, wait. I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

In the proton-proton chain:

1. Two protons (p) fuse to form a deuteron (D), emitting a positron (e+) and a neutrino (ν_e). The neutrino energy here is about 0.4 MeV. This is the main pp-I branch, which accounts for about 86% of the total neutrino flux.

2. The second step is when a proton captures a neutron (but wait, there's no neutron, maybe it's a different process). Alternatively, another branch where a deuteron captures a proton to form tritium (T), which then decays. This might produce higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, no, another approach: the neutrinos from the Sun are produced in different processes, each with different energies. The majority (about 90%) come from the pp-I branch, producing lower-energy neutrinos around 0.4 MeV. A smaller fraction comes from the pp-II branch, producing higher-energy neutrinos around 1.4 MeV. I'm not sure about the exact numbers, but maybe the pp-II produces around 1 MeV? Or perhaps around 1.4 MeV.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the details wrong. Let's try to get this straight. The main pp-I process produces neutrinos around 0.4 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos. So, the pp-III would produce even higher-energy neutrinos than pp-II. But I'm not entirely sure.

But for the purposes of this problem, if the pp-III branch stops, what would happen to the neutrino flux in the two energy bands? Let's imagine that the pp-III branch contributes significantly to high-energy neutrinos, maybe in the 800-900 keV range. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, 800-900 keV is 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. The pp-I neutrinos are at about 0.4 MeV, pp-II maybe around 1.4 MeV. So if pp-III produces even higher, like 2 MeV or so, then stopping pp-III would affect higher-energy neutrinos beyond 1 MeV.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces lower-energy neutrinos than pp-II. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main contributor to the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range. Wait, that's 0.7 to 0.8 MeV. That's higher than the 0.4 MeV of pp-I but lower than 1.4 MeV. So if pp-III stops, would the flux in 0.7-0.8 MeV drop significantly?

Wait, but if the pp-III was a minor branch, then its contribution to the flux in band 1 might be small. But if it stops, the flux in that band would decrease. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III isn't producing much in that band.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the pp-III process produces. Let me try to remember: the pp-III branch involves the capture of a proton by a helium-3 nucleus (triple-alpha process?), but no, that's for forming carbon in the CNO cycle. Wait no, the triple-alpha is part of the CNO cycle? No, the CNO cycle is a different process.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 ion captures two protons to form a carbon-12 nucleus. Oh wait, that's part of the CNO cycle, but the proton-proton chain is separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a side reaction where a helium-3 captures a proton to form a helium-4 and two protons. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the main pp-I and pp-II branches. If that's the case, then stopping the pp-III would reduce the flux in the higher-energy bands more than the lower ones.

So, the bands in question are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). If the pp-III is a major source of neutrinos in these bands, then stopping it would cause a significant drop in flux in these bands.

But wait, the main neutrino flux from the Sun is in the 0.4 MeV range. The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps around 1.4 MeV. So, the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are between 0.4 and 1.4. So, if the pp-III is a minor process that contributes neutrinos in that 0.7-0.9 MeV range, stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands.

But if pp-III is the only source in that range, then the flux in band 1 and band 2 would drop. Wait, but the question is about the ratio between the two bands after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, another angle: if the pp-III produces neutrinos in both bands, but more in one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos mainly in higher energy bands, so stopping it would affect band 2 more than band 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the flux. The total neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the pp-I branch, which is around 0.4 MeV. The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 1.4 MeV. The pp-III, as a minor branch, probably produces even higher-energy neutrinos, say around 2 MeV or so. So if pp-III is stopped, it would reduce the flux in the higher energy bands beyond 1 MeV. But the bands we're considering are 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV. If the pp-III doesn't contribute to these bands, then their fluxes wouldn't be affected. Hmm, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range. Then, stopping it would drop the flux in band 1 much more than band 2, or vice versa.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. The question is about the ratio of the fluxes in the two bands after the pp-III branch is stopped.

If the pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and a minor source in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), then stopping the pp-III would cause the flux in band 1 to drop more than in band 2. So the ratio (band1/band2) would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band 2. Or maybe the fluxes in both bands were originally similar, and stopping pp-III affects both, but which one is more affected?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos that are spread across higher energies, so the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are part of where pp-III contributes.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy distribution of the neutrinos from the different branches. Let me try to find (in my memory) the neutrino energy ranges.

The main pp-I branch (about 86% of total flux) produces neutrinos with around 0.42 MeV. So 0.42 MeV is just under 420 keV. So these neutrinos would be in the 0.4 MeV range.

The pp-II branch (maybe about 14% of the flux) produces higher-energy neutrinos. I think the pp-II process occurs when a deuteron (from the pp-I process) captures another proton, forming a triton (T), which then undergoes beta decay to helium-3, releasing a neutrino with higher energy. I think this neutrino is around 1.4 MeV. So pp-II contributes to higher-energy neutrinos.

So, the pp-III branch, being another branch, must produce even higher-energy neutrinos. Maybe around 2 MeV? Or perhaps in a different energy range.

Wait, but the bands are 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV, which are just slightly above the main pp-I neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in that region, then stopping it would impact the flux in those bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III isn't the main contributor to those bands, so stopping it wouldn't change the ratio much.

Wait, another approach: the question states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The neutrino flux we receive today is from the Sun's core, which takes about 8 minutes for light (and neutrinos) to reach Earth. So, after 8.5 minutes, we'd see the effect of the pp-III stopping.

But the question is about the ratio of the flux in bands 1 and 2. Before the pp-III stopped, how were the fluxes in these bands?

Assuming the pp-III was a minor contributor, then the flux in these bands might have been dominated by other processes. But if pp-III contributed a lot to these bands, then stopping it would cause a significant drop in those bands' fluxes.

Wait, but if pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) and a smaller source in band 1, then the ratio (band1/band2) would decrease.

Alternatively, if pp-III contributed more to band 1, then after stopping, band 1's flux would drop more than band 2's, making the ratio lower.

But without knowing exactly where the pp-III neutrinos fall, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III isn't the main contributor to either band, so the ratio remains roughly the same, leading to option C (1).

Wait, but the question states that pp-III was producing a significant flux, and we're to find the ratio after it stops. So, the ratio would change based on how much each band relied on pp-III.

If the pp-III produced a higher proportion of neutrinos in band 2 than in band 1, then stopping it would cause band 2's flux to drop more, making the ratio (band1/band2) increase.

Alternatively, if it produced more in band 1, the ratio would decrease.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III was a minor process, so stopping it wouldn't change the ratio much. But then the options are looking for a ratio change—so probably a significant change.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III contributes neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So, if the pp-III was the main source for these bands, then stopping it would cause a significant drop in both, but possibly more in one band.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos that are in higher energy bands than 0.9 MeV, so the fluxes in 0.7-0.9 MeV aren't affected much. So the ratio remains about the same, making the answer C (1).

Wait, but the problem says the pp-III branch stopped. So, if the pp-III was contributing to the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, then without it, the flux in those bands would drop.

But the question is about the ratio between the two bands. So, if both bands are equally affected by the pp-III stopping, the ratio would remain roughly the same. But if one band is more affected than the other, the ratio would change.

Assuming that the pp-III contributes neutrinos mainly in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), then stopping it would cause band 2's flux to drop more than band 1. So the ratio (band1/band2) would increase. If band 2's flux was twice as dependent on pp-III, then (band1/band2) would be higher than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes neutrinos in a way that is higher than 0.9 MeV, so the bands in question (0.7-0.9) are not much affected, making the ratio about 1.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: in the absence of the pp-III branch, which neutrino sources are left?

The main sources would be pp-I and pp-II. The pp-I produces ~0.4 MeV, and the pp-II produces ~1.4 MeV. So, the neutrinos in 0.7-0.9 MeV would come from these two branches? Or is there another source?

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher in energy. But the CNO cycle contributes about 2% of the Sun's neutrinos. So, in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, the main sources are pp-I and pp-II, but perhaps the pp-III is not a big contributor.

Wait, no. If pp-III is stopped, but other reactions (like pp-I and pp-II) continue. So, the question is whether the neutrinos in the two bands are mainly from pp-III or not.

If the two bands (0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV) are mainly from the pp-III, then stopping it would cause a significant drop in flux in those bands. But the ratio between the two bands might remain similar if both are equally affected.

Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes more to band 1 than band 2, then the ratio would decrease.

But without exact knowledge of the energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the pp-III process produces. The pp-III is another branch in the proton-proton chain, perhaps involving the capture of a proton by a helium-3 nucleus.

Wait, in the proton-proton chain, the main step is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Then, for the other branches: in the pp-II branch, a deuteron captures a proton to form triton, which beta decays to helium-3, producing a higher-energy neutrino.

The pp-III branch might involve the capture of a proton by a helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a carbon-12 nucleus (which is part of the CNO cycle?), but that's probably more associated with the CNO process.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 nucleus captures another helium-3 to form a helium-4 and two protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a less common pathway leading to the production of higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but regardless of the exact process, the important thing is the energy of the neutrinos it produces.

If the pp-III produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, then stopping it would impact those bands. But if it produces higher-energy neutrinos (like 1.4 MeV or more), then the two bands in question (0.7-0.9) are not much affected, and the ratio remains about the same.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute much to bands 1 and 2, then the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be about the same as before, which would be approximately 1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are around 0.7 MeV, so band 1 (0.7-0.8) would be more affected.

In that case, after stopping pp-III, the flux in band 1 would drop more than in band 2. So, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be less than 1.

So, if originally the ratio was around 1 (since the fluxes are similar), after stopping the pp-III which contributes more to band 1, the ratio would drop.

So, if band1's flux was, say, 50% from pp-III and band 2's was 10% from pp-III, then after stopping, band1's flux would drop by 50% and band2's by 10%. So, the new ratio would be (0.5)/(0.9)= ~0.555, which is about 0.5. So, the ratio would be around 0.5, which is option D (0.1 is 0.1, 0.01 is 0.01, 1 is 1, 10 is 10). Hmm, 0.5 isn't exactly any of the options, but perhaps the assumption is that the ratio goes down by a factor of 10.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently. Let's say that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the higher energy band (band 2). So, if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease more than in band 1.

So, the ratio (band1/band2) would increase. If before, the ratio was 1, after stopping pp-III, band2's flux is less, so the ratio would be higher than 1.

But the options include 10, which is a big jump. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes about 90% of the flux in band 2, and 10% in band 1. Then, after stopping, band1's flux would be 10% of its original, and band2's would be 10% of its original.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: before stopping, the flux in band1 is F1 = F_ppIII_band1 + F_ppI_band1 + F_ppII_band1.

Similarly, F2 = F_ppIII_band2 + F_ppI_band2 + F_ppII_band2.

If pp-III contributes a lot to band2, then F2 would drop a lot. Let's suppose that in band2, the pp-III contributes 90% of the flux, and in band1, it contributes only 10%. So, after stopping, F1_new = 0.9 F1 (because 10% comes from pp-III) and F2_new = 0.1 F2.

So, the ratio would be (0.9 F1) / (0.1 F2) = 9 (F1/F2).

Wait, but what was the original ratio (F1/F2) before stopping? If the main sources are pp-I and pp-II, which have their own distributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes about 10% of the total neutrino flux. Then, if it contributes more to band2, stopping it would reduce band2's flux more than band1's.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to say. But considering that the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

Alternatively, if pp-III is responsible for the majority of the neutrinos in band2, then after stopping, band2's flux would drop more, making the ratio (band1/band2) larger. So, if band1's flux is 10% from pp-III and band2's is 90% from pp-III, then the new ratio would be (0.1 F1_initial) / (0.1 F2_initial) = (F1_initial / F2_initial) * (0.1/0.1) = same as before. But that's if the rest of the flux (from pp-I and pp-II) doesn't contribute to these bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes neutrinos to both bands, but more to band2 than band1. So, if the pp-III is a major source for band2, then stopping it would make the flux in band2 drop more, so the ratio (band1/band2) increases.

But without knowing the exact contributions, perhaps the intended answer is that the flux ratio remains roughly the same, so the answer is C)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is not a major contributor to either band, so the fluxes in both bands are dominated by other processes. Thus, the ratio remains the same, so the answer is C.

Wait, but I remember that the main solar neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV (pp-I), and others are around 1.4 MeV (pp-II), and then there are others like the CNO cycle which produce higher-energy neutrinos. So, the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are between the main pp-I and the pp-II. So, maybe the pp-III doesn't contribute much to these bands, meaning that the ratio would remain around 1.

So, the answer would be C)1.

The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden cessation of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the neutrino flux observed on Earth in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The goal is to determine the approximate ratio of the fluxes in these bands after the pp-III branch stops.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production in the Sun**:
   - The proton-proton (pp) chain is the primary source of solar neutrinos. It includes three branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III.
   - The pp-I branch dominates, producing neutrinos with energies around 0.4 MeV.
   - The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, typically around 1.4 MeV.
   - The pp-III branch is a minor contributor and is hypothesized to produce neutrinos at even higher energies, possibly above 1 MeV.

2. **Energy Bands and pp-III Contribution**:
   - The bands in question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, or 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV) lie between the energies of the pp-I neutrinos (0.4 MeV) and the pp-II neutrinos (1.4 MeV).
   - If the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in this intermediate energy range, its cessation would significantly reduce the flux in these bands. However, if the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies (e.g., above 1 MeV), the bands in question would not be strongly affected.

3. **Impact of pp-III Cessation**:
   - If the pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in these bands, stopping it would reduce the flux in both bands. However, the relative reduction in flux between the two bands depends on how much the pp-III contributes to each band.
   - If the pp-III contributes more to band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) than to band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV), the flux in band 2 would drop more significantly, increasing the ratio \( \text{Flux(band 1)} / \text{Flux(band 2)} \).
   - Conversely, if the pp-III contributes equally to both bands or primarily to higher-energy bands (above 1 MeV), the fluxes in the two bands would remain relatively unaffected, leaving the ratio close to 1.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the lack of explicit information about the energy distribution of pp-III neutrinos, it is reasonable to assume that the pp-III does not dominate the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. Thus, the fluxes in both bands would remain largely unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch, leading to a ratio close to 1.

### Final Answer:
The approximate ratio of the fluxes in the two bands remains unchanged, making the correct answer:

**Answer: C**
