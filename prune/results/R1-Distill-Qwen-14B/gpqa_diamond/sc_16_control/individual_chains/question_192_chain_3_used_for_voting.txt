Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere with a smaller sphere-shaped hole somewhere off-center.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which means P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, and how does the charge distribute in the conductor? Since the conductor was initially uncharged, I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it must be zero. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Oh right! For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. So, when you place a charge inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the cavity's charge. Wait, no. Wait, the initial conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. That way, the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the inner surface is -q; these would create an electric field within the conductor, but wait, no, because the conductor is a conductor, the field inside must be zero. So, the inner surface's induced charge would cancel the field from the +q inside the cavity. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge +q. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q to balance it, keeping the conductor's total charge zero.

So, the outer surface has +q. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The conductor is neutral, so if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. But wait, the conductor's overall charge is zero, so let me think again. The conductor's initial charge is zero. The charge +q is inside the cavity. So, the inner surface must have -q (so that the field inside the conductor is zero), and the outer surface must have +q (since the inner surface is -q and the conductor's total is zero, so outer is +q). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. So, if inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q, but that would make the total charge of the conductor (-q) + (+q) = 0. Oh, right, that's correct.

But wait, actually, the conductor's charge is zero, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner surface is -q. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q. But wait, no, the outer surface's charge is the same as the charge inside the cavity. Because when you have a charge inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor gets an induced charge of opposite sign, and the outer surface has the same charge as the cavity's. Or wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (because the conductor is a conductor, and the cavity's charge induces an opposite charge on the nearby surface). So the inner surface has -q. Then, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, the outer is +q, so total conductor charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

But hang on, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges can move freely. The presence of the +q in the cavity would cause the electrons in the conductor to move towards the cavity, leaving the outer surface with a net positive charge. So, the outer surface's charge is +q.

But wait, I'm pretty sure that the outer surface's charge is the same as the charge inside the cavity. So, the point P is outside the conductor. So, the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. Because the inner charge (-q) is enclosed within the conductor, and the conductor's material is neutral except for the surface charges.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So, when you're outside the conductor, the electric field is the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor is a sphere, the electric field outside it is as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the options don't all present that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to match. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, but another thought: the conductor is a spherical shell, but the cavity is not at the center. The cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So, the induced charges on the conductor will arrange themselves in a way that the internal field inside the conductor is zero. But, when looking at the outer surface, the charge on the outer surface is +q, but how is it distributed?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in such a way that the electric field just outside the conductor is radial and depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. Wait, but wait, in this case, the outer surface's charge is +q, but is it uniformly distributed? I think the charge distribution on the outer surface depends on the geometry. Because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge is not uniform. The inner surface's charge density is higher near the cavity's charge. But for the outer surface, since the conductor is neutral except for the outer +q, does the outer charge distribute uniformly?

Wait, the conductor is a sphere. So, in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So, the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is spherical. Because any external fields would have to be accounted for, but in this case, the only charge outside is the conductor itself.

Wait, no. Because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, so the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform. But the outer surface, being a sphere, will have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is neutral and the only charge is +q on the outer surface. Wait, no, the conductor is a sphere but the cavity is off-center. So, the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves to cancel any internal fields, but they might not be uniform if there's an external field. But in this case, the only field inside the conductor is zero, so the outer surface must be a uniform sphere. Because the conductor is a sphere, regardless of the cavity's position, the outer surface would distribute the charge uniformly. Because the presence of the inner charge (the cavity's charge) would cause the inner surface to have a non-uniform charge, but the outer surface is symmetric. Wait, actually, no. Because the cavity is not centered, the inner surface's charge distribution is non-uniform. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution would still be uniform because any asymmetry in the inner surface would cause the outer surface to adjust to ensure that the conductor's interior is field-free.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So, the conductor is a sphere. The presence of the +q charge inside the cavity (which is at a distance s from the center) causes the inner surface to have a charge distribution that's not uniform. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would have a uniform charge distribution because any asymmetry in the inner surface would cause the outer surface's charge to distribute symmetrically. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge will be uniformly distributed, regardless of the cavity's position.

So, the outer surface has a charge of +q, uniformly distributed. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because for a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were at the center.

So, the point P is outside, at a distance L from the conductor's center. So, the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². That's option B.

Wait, but what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? Like, if the charge were placed off-center, would that affect the electric field outside? I remember that for a spherical conductor, the external field only depends on the total charge of the outer surface. So, no matter where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the external field is the same, as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait, in reality, if the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge would be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge would still be uniformly distributed. Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface must be symmetric. So, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, and the electric field outside is as if the charge were at the center. So, the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't matter for the external field.

So, in this problem, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed. So, the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again about the other options. Option B is correct, but let me make sure.

Option A: 1/(4πε₀) * q / (l - s cosθ)^2. Hmm, that would be the case if the charge were at a distance (l - s cosθ) from P, but I don't think that's the case here. Because the conductor's charge is on the outer surface, which is a sphere. So, the field at P depends only on the total charge, not the position of the charge inside.

Option C: 1/(4πε₀) * q / (l + s cosθ)^2. That seems similar to option A but with a plus. I don't think that's correct.

Option D: 1/(4πε₀) * q / l². That would be the case if the field was due to a charge located at a distance l from P, but in this case, the conductor's charge is at the center, so l isn't the right parameter here. Because L is the distance from the conductor's center to P.

Wait, but wait, in the setup, point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. And the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. But the point is outside the conductor, so L> R. So, the electric field at P would be due to the outer surface's charge, which is at the conductor's center, so the distance is L. So, the correct expression would involve L squared in the denominator.

So, option B is correct. So, the answer should be B.

The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) located off-center at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution in the Conductor**:  
   - The conductor is initially neutral. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor.  
   - To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$.  

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and not on the distribution of charge inside the cavity.  
   - Since the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution (as it is a sphere), the electric field at a point outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.  

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**:  
   - Point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This expression suggests the electric field depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$ from the center.  
   - **Option B**: This matches the correct expression for the electric field outside the conductor, as derived above.  
   - **Option C**: This expression suggests the electric field depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the electric field depends on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.  

### Conclusion:
The correct electric field at point $P$ is given by Option B.
