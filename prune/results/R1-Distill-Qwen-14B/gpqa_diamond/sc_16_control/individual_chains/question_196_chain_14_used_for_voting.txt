Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I've studied the harmonic oscillator in my mechanics class, but this is the relativistic version, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states it's a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, right, in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I can't use the classical formulas directly because they don't account for relativistic effects. Oh right, relativistic effects become significant when speeds approach the speed of light c.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(k A²/m). But that's non-relativistic. Since this is relativistic, I need to adjust for the fact that kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh wait, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is shared between kinetic and potential, but I think in the maximum speed point, all the energy is kinetic.

Wait no, actually, in the classical harmonic oscillator, at the extremes (x = A), all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all is kinetic. So in the relativistic case, when x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But wait, wait, in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy is the same because Hooke's law is F = -kx, which is non-relativistic. Or is it? Because in reality, F is relativistic, but the force law here is given as F = -kx, so maybe the potential is still (1/2)k x².

Wait, but the kinetic energy would be relativistic. So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x=0, all is kinetic, so E = K = (gamma - 1) m c². At x=A, E is the potential (1/2)k A². So by conservation of energy, (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c² when the oscillator is at x=0, moving at maximum speed.

Wait no, no. Wait, when x=A, the system is at rest for a moment, so the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. But in that case, all the energy is potential. Then, when the oscillator passes through x=0, it has maximum kinetic energy. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A². So at x=0, E is all kinetic. So E = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So, I can set up the equation:

(gamma -1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max² → v_max = sqrt(k A²/m). But that's non-relativistic.

So, solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let’s compute it. Let’s let’s call that term a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + a).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2].

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

Expanding (1+a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a²,

So numerator becomes 1 + 2a + a² - 1 = 2a + a².

Thus,

v² = c² (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug it in:

a = k A²/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ] / ( 1 + k A²/(2 m c²) )^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = k A²/(m c²).

The other term is (k A²)^2/(4 m² c^4).

So numerator is [ k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ].

This can be factorized as [ (2 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4) ) ].

Wait, maybe it's better to factor in terms of a. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (k A²/(2 m c²))² as a².

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Let me go back to the expression for v²:

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But a = k A²/(2 m c²), so:

v² = c² [ (2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ) ] / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) )^2.

Let me compute each part:

Compute numerator inside the brackets:

2a = 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) = k A²/(m c²).

a² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So numerator inside is k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Factor out k A²/(4 m² c^4):

Wait, let's write both terms over a common denominator.

The first term is (4 m c² * k A² ) / (4 m² c^4) ) → 4 m c² * k A² / denominator.

Wait, let me compute:

k A²/(m c²) = [k A² * 4 m c^2 ] / [4 m² c^4 ].

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me take another approach.

Let me factor the numerator as:

k A²/(m c²) [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (1/( )) ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to just compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Compute numerator:

2a + a² = a (2 + a).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But a = k A²/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this.

Alternatively, let me write everything in terms of a.

v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

= c² [ a (2 + a) ) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Now, perhaps 2 + a = (1 + a) +1.

Not sure. Alternatively, I can factor a as a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Wait, maybe it's better to write everything in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Let me denote that as a again.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently.

Looking at the expression for v²:

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator as a (2 + a) → but not sure.

Wait, let me compute 2a + a² = a^2 + 2a = a(a + 2). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator: (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a². So not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for v in terms of a.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write 2a + a² as a(a + 2). Hmm.

Alternatively, let me compute 2a + a² = a (a + 2) = a (a + 2).

Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

(2a + a²) = a (a + 2) = a [ (a + 1) + 1 ].

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can instead think of the entire expression as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

= c^2 [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, I can write the numerator as a (2 +a) = a ( (1 +a ) + 1 ). So,

= c^2 [ a ( (1 + a) +1 ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

= c^2 [ a (1 +a ) + a ] / (1 +a )^2.

= c^2 [ a + a^2 + a ] / (1 + a )^2.

Wait, no, that's perhaps more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 2a + a² = a ( a + 2 ) = a ( [ (1 + a) ] + 1 ), so:

= c^2 * [ a ( (1+a) + 1 ) ] / (1+a )^2.

= c^2 [ a (1+a +1) ] / (1 +a)^2.

= c^2 [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 +a)^2.

Wait, that brings us back. Hmm, maybe I should just compute the entire fraction.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

(2a +a²) = a(a+2) = a ( (1 +a) +1 )

So,

= c^2 [ a ( (1 +a) +1 ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

= c^2 [ a (1 +a) / (1+a)^2 + a * 1 / (1 +a)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ a/(1+a) + a/(1+a)^2 ]

= c^2 [ a ( (1 +a ) + 1 ) / (1 +a )^2 ) ]

Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor something else out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can expand the denominator and numerator.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see the options and see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - k A²/(2 m) )^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - k A²/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, the expression under the square root is 1 + something. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A^2 / m ). That's the non-relativistic case, so probably not the correct answer here.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm. Let's think.

Wait, I had earlier:

v^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 +a)^2.

Where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So substituting a:

v^2 = c^2 [ 2a + a² ] / (1 + a)^2.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2a +a² = a (2 + a) = a ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ).

Denominator: (1 + a )^2 = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]^2.

So,

v^2 = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Express a as (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me compute:

Let me factor out a from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

2a + a² = a ( 2 + a )

And the denominator is (1 + a)^2.

So,

v^2 = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm. Let me compute 2 + a = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² ).

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Let me write 2 + a as (1 + a) +1.

So,

2 + a = (1 + a) + 1.

Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2 + a) as 2(1 + a) - a.

No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as a (2 + a) = a ( (1 + a) + 1 )

So,

Numerator = a (1 +a ) + a.

So,

v^2 = c² [ (a (1 +a ) + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Split the fraction:

= c² [ a (1 + a )/(1 + a )^2 + a/(1 + a )^2 ]

= c² [ a/(1 +a ) + a/(1 +a )^2 ]

= c² [ a ( (1 +a ) + 1 ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

Wait, that doesn't seem to get me anywhere.

Hmm, maybe I should compute a and express everything numerically.

But perhaps looking at the options, perhaps option B is plausible.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that would be:

v = c * sqrt( 1 + [ 1/(1 - x) ] ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But in my expression, I have:

v^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2, with a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, perhaps let me compute the expression in terms of a.

v^2 = c² (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

I can factor the numerator as a (2 + a) and denominator as (1 + a)^2.

Wait, but 2 + a = (1 + a) +1, so:

v^2 = c² [ a ( (1 +a ) +1 ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

= c² [ a (1+a )/(1+a )^2 + a *1/(1+a )^2 ]

= c² [ a/(1+a ) + a/(1+a )^2 ]

Hmm, that doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

v^2 = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Let me let’s compute this expression numerically for a small a.

But perhaps I can re-express it as:

v² = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

= c² [ a (2 +a ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

= c² [ a (2 +a ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Let me try to expand the denominator:

(1 + a )^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 +a ) ] / (1 + 2a + a² )

Hmm, perhaps I can write 2 + a = 2 + a = (1 + 2a + a² ) + (1 - 2a - a² )

Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps let's factor 2 + a as (1 + a) +1.

So,

= c² [ a ( (1+a) +1 ) ] / (1+a )^2.

= c² [ a/(1+a ) * ( (1+a) +1 ) ) ] / (1 +a )

= c² [ a (1 +a +1 ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expression for v in terms of a.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator and denominator as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ a (2 +a) ] / (1 +a )^2.

= c^2 * [ a (2 +a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Let me write 2 + a as (a +2 ) = (a +1 ) +1.

So,

= c^2 [ a ( (a +1 ) +1 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

= c^2 [ a (a +1 +1 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

= c^2 [ a (a +2 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

v^2 = c^2 [ a (a +2 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

= c^2 [ a ( a + 2 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor a +2 as (a +1 ) +1.

So,

= c^2 [ a ( (a +1 ) +1 ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

= c^2 [ a (a +1 ) + a ] / (a +1 )^2.

= c^2 [ a (a +1 )/(a +1 )^2 + a/(a +1 )^2 ].

= c^2 [ a/(a +1 ) + a/(a +1 )^2 ].

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

a ( a + 2 ) = a^2 + 2a.

Denominator: (a +1 )^2 = a^2 + 2a +1.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (a^2 + 2a ) ] / (a^2 + 2a +1 )

= c^2 [ (a^2 + 2a) / (a+1)^2 ]

= c^2 [ (a (a + 2 )) / (a +1 )^2 ]

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (a+1)^2 minus something.

Wait, numerator is a^2 + 2a = (a+1)^2 -1.

Because (a+1)^2 = a^2 + 2a +1 → so (a^2 + 2a ) = (a+1)^2 -1.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (a +1 )^2 -1 ) / (a +1)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ 1 - (1)/(a +1 )^2 ]

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( 1 - 1/(a +1 )^2 )

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(a +1 )^2 )

But a is (k A² )/(2 m c² ).

So,

a +1 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 ) )

Which can be written as:

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Looking at the options, this is option D.

Wait, option D is:

D) v_max= c sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) )

Which matches what I've derived.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is relativistic kinetic energy, \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at both points:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2} \right).
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2} \right).
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression under the square root does not match the derived result.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The expression under the square root is inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct. Matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Answer: D
