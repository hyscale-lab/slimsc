Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'll need to figure out what each step does, especially the final product's NMR spectrum.

First, let me outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product 1. The product is a light yellow solid. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Hmm, what's that structure?

2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. I'm not exactly sure about this step, but aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride or something that can form an acylium ion.

3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. Then, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Let me tackle each step one by one.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

Dibromoadamantane suggests two bromine atoms on the adamantane structure. When heated with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it might eliminate to form an alkene. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an E2 elimination.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, and 1,3 positions are diagonally opposite. But regardless, when you have two adjacent bromines, elimination would form an alkene. Wait, but if they're on adjacent carbons, that's vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond.

But wait, another possibility: if the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH in a solution would likely lead to elimination, forming an olefin. Specifically, an elimination reaction would form 1,3-diene? Or maybe a bridged diene structure because of the adamantane framework.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something with an ester or ketone group because the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, KOH in what conditions? If it's aqueous, maybe it's an SN2 reaction, but with two Br atoms? Maybe it's a double substitution.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with aqueous KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by OH groups. But that would give 1,3-diol, but I don't think that's right because the IR would show hydroxyl (O-H) stretches, which might be broad, but the IR here shows 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization or some kind of elimination to form a ketone. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH (excess) at high temperature. Considering the structure, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond. But how would that produce a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but dehydrohalogenation. Wait, no, KOH is a base, so E2 elimination. But then, if two bromines are adjacent, elimination would form a double bond, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait another thought: Maybe the KOH is in a protic solvent, like ethanol or water. So perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two leaving groups, perhaps an SN2 on each end, but that would produce a diol, not a carbonyl.

Wait, unless it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 doesn't fit an epoxide. Alternatively, if the reaction produces a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is an alkene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps an elimination forms a ketone via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? No, but the NMR has peaks that might not fit that.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a cyclopropane or something else. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data of product 1:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): That's a singlet, perhaps from an -OCH₂- group. Alternatively, maybe a CH₂ next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Since the IR has a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, 4.79 ppm for 2H, perhaps an OCH₂ group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be from the adamantane structure, perhaps as CH₂ groups in a rigid structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ group adjacent to something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide? No, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, and I don't see that here.

Another idea: Maybe the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches (like broad peaks around 3300), so maybe not. Alternatively, it's an ester. The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, which could be an ester or ketone.

Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a ketone. Or maybe it's a substitution to form a glycol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction forms a diketone. Wait, but how? Maybe via a double elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. But that's not matching the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. If so, the NMR would have a peak from the carbonyl adjacent protons. Let's think about the NMR: 4.79ppm (2H). If it's a ketone, perhaps it's an acetyl group, but the 2H suggests maybe an OCH₂ group, as in an ester.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, but that would require two OH groups on the same carbon, which isn't likely from a vicinal dihalide. Alternatively, maybe a diol where each OH is on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide. But then the NMR would show more downfield shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The IR would have a carbonyl peak, and the NMR would show a conjugated double bond. But the 4.79 ppm could be the protons adjacent to the carbonyl, like in an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form an allene, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Let me try to think of another approach. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, which could be an ester or a ketone. The NMR has a singlet at 4.79 (2H), maybe an OCH₂ group. Let me imagine the structure.

Suppose product 1 is an epoxide, but the carbonyl in the IR doesn't fit. So perhaps it's an ester. If the structure is an ester, maybe the formula would be something like (CH₂)₂OAc or similar.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution, but with two Br groups, perhaps leading to a diol. But that would have OH groups, and the IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned, unless they're exchanged with the solvent.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have a broad peak, so maybe the product isn't a diol. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that's unlikely from a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring, but I don't think that fits the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a geminal dihalide, but that would require two Br in the same position, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is bonded to two or three others. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? Or maybe on opposite ends.

Wait, perhaps heating with KOH leads to elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond or a ring contraction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction forms an ester via substitution. Wait, but how would Br become an ester group? Unless there's an acylation involved, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile for acylation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a ketone. Suppose that each Br undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a diketone.

So, the structure would have two ketone groups. But the NMR would then show protons near the carbonyls. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait: in a ketone, the adjacent CH₂ would typically be around 2.1-2.5 ppm, but 4.79 is more upfield for that. Alternatively, maybe the CH₂ is part of an ester group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on product 1. Maybe I should proceed to the next step and see if that helps.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst. It's commonly used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is an acyl chloride, it could act as an acylating agent in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But product 1 might not be an acyl chloride.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group. So if product 1 is an ester, then perhaps it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Alternatively, if product 1 is an aromatic compound with an acylium ion, it could form a ketone.

Wait, but product 1 is derived from adamantane, which is a polycyclic structure. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the Friedel-Crafts would acylate something, but adamantane doesn't have aromatic rings. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it forms an acylium ion, which could undergo some kind of cyclization or addition.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diester, and the Friedel-Crafts would lead to an acylation.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me think about product 3, which comes from ozonolysis of product 2.

Ozonolysis breaks alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms product 3.

So, working backward, product 2 must be an alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, producing carbonyl groups.

So product 2 is an alkene. How did product 2 become an alkene? Product 1 was treated with Al(OiPr)3, so perhaps product 1 was a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: Product 1 is an ester, maybe. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the Friedel-Crafts would generate an acylium ion which could undergo elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, the structure of product 2 must be an alkene, so that ozonolysis can act on it. So maybe product 2 is a di-substituted alkene.

Now, let's re-examine product 1. If product 1 is an ester, perhaps something like an adamantyl acetate. The NMR would have an OCH2CO group. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the OCH₂, which is split into a singlet because the two H are equivalent. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be the rest of the adamantane structure, and 1.94 (2H) could be the CH₂ adjacent to the ester.

So product 1 could be 1-adamantyl acetate. Let me think: the structure would have an OAc group attached to the adamantane. So, the molecule would have an ester group, hence the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

If that's the case, then when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it forms an acylium ion. Wait, but Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid and can help in generating acylium ions from esters. Once the acylium ion is formed, it could undergo some reaction. But what?

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is heated with Al(OiPr)3 to form an enol ether, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the ester is converted into an acid chloride, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: The ester could undergo a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring. Since adamantane doesn't have aromatic rings, perhaps this isn't the path.

Alternatively, maybe the ester group is converted into a ketone via some elimination. Wait, if the ester is hydrolyzed, but that's usually done under acidic or basic conditions. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Al(OiPr)3 is acting as a catalyst for an elimination reaction, turning the ester into an alkene. So, if product 1 is 1-adamantyl acetate, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 might cause the acetate to lose an oxygen and form a double bond. Wait, that would form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group (OAc) is adjacent to a CH₂ group. If the ester is at a position where elimination can occur, maybe it loses an ester group and forms a double bond. For example, if the structure is CH₂-OAc, perhaps elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester with a structure that allows for elimination upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3.

Assuming that, then product 2 would be an alkene. So, when product 1 (maybe an ester) is treated with Al(OiPr)3, it eliminates the ester group and forms a double bond, giving an alkene.

Then, product 3 is the ozonolysis product of that alkene. Ozonolysis generally cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the ¹H NMR of product 3. Specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those exchanging with the solvent.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment has a carbonyl group. So, if the alkene was symmetric, the products would be the same on both sides. But in an asymmetric case, different fragments would form.

But in the case of an adamantane-derived compound, the structure would be symmetric, so perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a symmetric di-substituted alkene would give two identical carbonyl compounds. So, if product 2 is an alkene in the adamantane framework, perhaps product 3 is a ketone.

Wait, but the problem says that ozone was bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. I recall that ozonolysis followed by workup with a reductant like dimethyl sulfide typically leads to cleavage into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents on the double bond.

So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds. If the alkene was in a symmetric position on adamantane, the product would be a single compound.

Now, let's think about the coupling pattern. The most deshielded proton would likely be near electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl. So, in the NMR of product 3, this proton's coupling would depend on adjacent protons.

If the structure is something like a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Let's say each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH₂ group. So, each of these CH₂ groups would be near the carbonyl and would have coupling with neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, the structure could be something like O=C-R, where R is a group from the adamantane. So, if the R group is a CH₂ group, then the protons on CH₂ would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

In such a case, each CH₂ would have two protons, which are each coupled with their neighboring group. But wait, if the CH₂ is adjacent to the carbonyl, each proton on the CH₂ would be next to the carbonyl and possibly coupled with other protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (CH₂)₂CO. So, each CH₂ group is adjacent to a carbonyl. Let me imagine a structure where ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls, each attached to a CH₂ group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of the structure of product 2. If product 2 is an alkene, perhaps it's in a position where ozonolysis would split it into two identical ketones.

Alternative approach: Let's model this with a simple structure. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-diene in adamantane. Upon ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved into two ketones. Wait, but ozonolysis of a single double bond would give two carbonyl groups.

Wait, if product 2 is a mono-alkene in the adamantane structure, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. Each end would have a carbonyl group, perhaps.

Assuming that, the most deshielded proton would be the one attached to the carbonyl. In the case of a ketone, the adjacent CH₂ group's protons would be split based on their neighboring groups.

If the structure is such that each carbonyl is next to a CH₂ group, and each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, then the protons on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would have coupling with the adjacent CH₂'s protons.

So, for example, if we have O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CO, but that might not fit the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, the structure might be such that each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, which is adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, the protons on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring protons (each from the adjacent CH₂), leading to a triplet of triplets or some other multiplet.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting depends on the number of neighboring protons. If each CH₂ next to the carbonyl has two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH₂ group, then each proton would couple with two protons on each side. Wait, but that might be more than a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a branching. Let me think of a specific example. Consider 2,3-dichlorobutane. Ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But in our case, it's more about the coupling in the product.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group. So, each proton on the first CH₂ would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each H on the first CH₂ would be next to two H on the adjacent CH₂. So, each H would have two neighboring H, leading to a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each H has two neighboring H on the same CH₂ and one from another group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, another possibility: The most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is connected to another CH₂ group. So, each H in the first CH₂ would be next to two H in the adjacent CH₂. That would cause each H to be split into a triplet.

Wait, but each H in the CH₂ would have two neighboring H from the adjacent CH₂, so each would have a coupling with two H, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ groups are in a chain, each H would have two adjacent H, leading to a triplet.

So, in the NMR, the most deshielded H (on the CH₂ next to CO) would be split into a triplet.

Looking back at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the coupling is with two neighboring H, the splitting would be a triplet. So option A would be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Another scenario: if the deshielded proton is part of a CH group, adjacent to another CH with two H, then that might give a different pattern.

Wait, but in the product 3, the structure likely has CH₂ groups, not CH, since the starting material is adamantane, which has all CH₂ groups.

So, the most deshielded H is on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. That CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, each of whose H is two. So, each H in this CH₂ would couple with two H from the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet.

So the correct answer would be A) triplet.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the final determination of the coupling pattern in the NMR spectrum of product 3:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with an ester group (-OCH₂-) and a rigid adamantane framework. Thus, product 1 is likely 1-adamantyl acetate.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the elimination of the ester group, forming an alkene (product 2). The resulting structure is an alkene in the adamantane framework.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. Given the symmetry of the adamantane framework, product 3 is likely a diketone.

4. **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton is part of a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens in the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

**Answer: A**
