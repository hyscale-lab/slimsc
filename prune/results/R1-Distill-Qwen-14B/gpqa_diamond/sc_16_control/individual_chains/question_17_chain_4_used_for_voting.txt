Okay, I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these concepts. But I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I think.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and it's a 1:1 ratio because Ca is in the +2 charge and EDTA^4- would balance that, I think. So the formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part.

Wait, I should probably write out the relevant chemical equation. The formation of the complex is probably: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. And the formation constant K is given, which is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Oh right, Kf is the formation constant, and it's a very large number, which means the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So, in a solution with excess EDTA, most of the Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M.

But we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because the EDTA is a strong chelating agent, the free Ca²+ concentration is going to be really low, right? Since Kf is so large.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as 'x'. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be 'y'. But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, so when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA²− produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So, for every 'x' of Ca²+ released, 'y' would be equal to 'x' as well.

Wait, actually, no. Because if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x concentration of Ca²+ and x of EDTA^4-, then the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 - x, but since K is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, the denominator in Kf would be (x)(y). But since the stoichiometry is 1:1, y is approximately x as well.

So, Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) ) ≈ 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, no, Kf is given as 5e10, which is 5x10^10. So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2)

So, solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10

x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, let me compute that properly. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12.

Which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So, x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 *10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, no, wait: 1e-12 is (1e-6)^2. So 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Hmm, but for practical purposes, sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, because 2e-6.5 is 2 divided by 1e6.5. 1e6 is a million, 1e3 is a thousand, so 1e6.5 is about 3.16e6. So, 2 /3.16e6 ≈ 6.32e-7.

So, x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So, the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the one.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. The Kf is 5e10, the complex concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kf = (0.02) / (x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. The square root is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. Correct.

So, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions (\( [Ca^{2+}] \)) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant (\( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \)) and the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) are equal at equilibrium, denoted as \( x \). The concentration of the complex at equilibrium is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) because \( x \) is expected to be very small compared to 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
x \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
