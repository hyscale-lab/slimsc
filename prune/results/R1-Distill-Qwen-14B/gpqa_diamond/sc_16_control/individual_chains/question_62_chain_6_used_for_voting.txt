Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's take it step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) attached. Then, the substituent is at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that's like a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexyl group attached. So, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde, and on the adjacent carbon, a methyl group that has both an OH and a cyclohexyl substituent.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to a CH2 group, I think), so the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no, ethynyl is the substituent. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2 group attached. So, the structure is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane ring.

Now, the question is about the correct sequence of reagents to go from ethynylcyclohexane to that target molecule. Let me look at the options and think about each step.

So the options are A, B, C, D. Each option has a series of reagents. I need to figure out which sequence would achieve the transformation.

Let me think about what each step might do. The target molecule has an aldehyde group and an alcohol group attached to a cyclohexane. Also, the substituents are arranged in a way that suggests some kind of elimination or addition steps.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. How do I get from there to the target?

Let me think about the possible reactions. Ethynyl groups can undergo various additions. Maybe hydroboration? Or perhaps some kind of oxidation or reduction.

Wait, maybe the triple bond can be used to form rings. Because the target has a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the triple bond is involved in forming a ring through some cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe I can add a group to the ethynyl group.

Wait, another approach: the target has a structure where a cyclohexane ring is attached to a CH(OH)Cyclohexane-CHO. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is at the end of a chain, and through some reactions, it becomes a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl. For example, oxidation of a terminal alkyne (ethynyl) to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is not a terminal alkyne. No, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. So, the alkyne is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So, the triple bond is between the CH2 and the ethynyl group. So, if I can perform a reaction that adds a group to the alkyne, maybe.

Hmm, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the ethynyl group. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination or for deprotonating something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the first reagent is for a Grignard or similar reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it's used for deprotonation to form a metal acetylide. So, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (the triple bond is between two carbons, with one end being CH2 and the other CH attached to the cyclohexane). Wait, no, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is between the two carbons, with CH2 attached to the cyclohexane and CH attached to the other end.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So, the alkyne is a terminal one. Therefore, treating it with a strong base like NaNH2 would deprotonate it, forming a cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C⁻ Na+.

But then, what's the next reagent? Looking at the options, after NaNH2 and something, the next step varies.

Option A: after NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would be a methylating agent. So, perhaps in the presence of a strong base, it would perform an alkylation.

Wait, if we have a sodium acetylide, adding methyl chloride would alkylate it. So, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group.

Wait, but the acetylide is a strong base. So, adding CH3Cl would result in an alkylation, making the acetylide longer.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2-...? Wait, no, wait. The structure after deprotonation is CH2-C≡C⁻. Adding CH3Cl would give CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl. But wait, that's CH2Cl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide.

Hmm, not entirely sure. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the triple bond is converted into an alcohol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a deprotonation to form the acetylide, and then perform some kind of alkylation or other reaction.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the first step is to form a cyclohexenyl ring via a elimination. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can be used for a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: the triple bond can be used in a Grignard-like addition. Or perhaps used to form a ketone via an oxidation.

Wait, for a terminal alkyne, one common reaction is to oxidize it to a carboxylic acid. But that would require specific reagents, like O3 followed by something else.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkene via hydrogenation. So, if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, then perhaps that can undergo some additions.

Wait, but looking at the target molecule, there's an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, oxidation of a terminal alkyne (RC≡CH) can yield a ketone (RCOCH3) under certain conditions. But wait, our starting alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. So, that would be CH2-C≡CH; perhaps after oxidation, it would become CH2-CO-OH (but that's a carboxylic acid). Or maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about each reagent option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, that's a bit confusing because step 3 is repeated. Maybe a typo. But moving on.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S;4. Ba(OH)2.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm. Let's think step by step.

The starting compound is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

We need to get to 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the target has a cyclohexane ring, a methyl group attached to it, and that methyl has both an OH and a cyclohexyl group. Also, the main ring has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves several steps: formation of a ring, oxidation, perhaps some kind of oxidation or reduction.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, then into an alcohol, then something else.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is used to form a cyclopropane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting alkyne is subjected to a reaction that forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the target molecule. The substituent on the cyclohexane is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, that’s a chiral center with an OH, a cyclohexyl group, and two CH2 groups (since it's attached to the cyclohexane and a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and another cyclohexyl).

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a vinylogous aldol reaction or some kind of cycloaddition.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting alkyne undergoes a hydroboration, but that seems unlikely with NaNH2.

Let me think again about each option.

Option C has steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would form a methylated acetylide.

So, ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 (a strong base) would deprotonate the triple bond to form the acetylide ion: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C⁻ Na+.

Then, methyl chloride would methylate it. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, forming cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But wait, CH2-C≡C-CH3 is 1-pentyne? No. Wait, perhaps it's becoming a longer alkyne.

Alternatively, maybe it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So, after alkylation, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl, so when the acetylide attacks, it would add a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-... but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the acetylide is at the end of the chain. So, the acetylide is CH2-C≡C⁻. When CH3Cl is added, the acetylide (a strong base) would deprotonate CH3Cl, but wait, CH3Cl is a methylating agent. So, perhaps the acetylide attacks CH3Cl, methylating the acetylide.

So, the product would be CH2-C≡C-CH3? But wait, that's 1-propyne, but attached to cyclohexane. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Is that possible?

Hmm, but then the second step in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation. So, the triple bond would be hydrogenated into a single bond with two H's, making CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would produce cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's cyclohexane with a butyl group? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is between CH2 and CH3. So, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, but that would require adding two H's across the triple bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-C-C-CH3, but that's not possible without any other substituents. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) to an alkane would require adding four H's: converting C≡C to C-C. But the reagent H2 with Pd would typically hydrogenate an alkyne to an alkene first, and then further to an alkane. Or perhaps under specific conditions, it stops at the alkene.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, turning the triple bond into a single bond but with two new hydrogens. Or more accurately, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond would require adding four H's: each carbon of the triple bond would add two H's, so the triple bond becomes a single bond with four H's added. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a single bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the triple bond CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be butane, attached to cyclohexane.

But I'm not certain how that helps. Because the target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps I should think of other possibilities. Let me consider the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) at position 1. Then, position 1 also has a substituent which is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexyl group is derived from the starting material. So, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is used in a way that the cyclohexane ring becomes part of the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a ring via some cycloaddition. For example, a [2+2] cycloaddition with another alkyne, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is involved in a ring-forming reaction, such as a Cope elimination or some other process. But I'm not entirely familiar with how that would work.

Wait, another approach: think about the transformations each reagent would cause.

Option D's steps: NaNH2, methanol; then Li/lithium in liquid ammonia; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol: That's a deprotonation followed by some reaction. The alkyne would deprotonate to form an acetylide, then perhaps react with methanol. But methanol is a nucleophile. So, perhaps the acetylide would attack methanol, leading to an alkylation. Wait, but methanol is R-OH, so maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps in the presence of NaNH2, which is a strong base, the ethynylcyclohexane would form an acetylide, and then methanol (as a methylating agent) would add a methyl group. So, the acetylide (CH2-C≡C⁻) would attack the methanol, but wait, methanol is CH3OH. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would abstract a proton from something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol via an SN2 mechanism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group, but I'm not exactly sure.

But moving on. Step 2 in option D is Li in liquid NH3. That's a condition often used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form enolates or for alkyne reductions. Wait, Li in NH3 is a strong base and can be used for elimination reactions, or for reductions.

Wait, another thought: Li in liquid NH3 is used in the presence of diiodomethane to effect the formation of alkanes from alkynes via a two-step addition (like the lithium aluminum hydride reduction but perhaps under milder conditions). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation, leading to enolates or for the formation of alkenes via elimination.

Wait, after the first step (NaNH2 and methanol), the product would be something with a new group attached. Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe that's a deprotonation step.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming an acetylide and then alkylation with methanol, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option B: first step is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, similar to option A and C, starting with deprotonation and alkylation. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Step 3 is O3 and H2O; step 4 is NH4OH.

Hmm, O3 and H2O is ozonolysis, typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, after an alkene is formed, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But where would the alkene come from?

Wait, perhaps the first step is forming an ethylated acetylide, then perhaps hydrogenating it, then something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexene ring, which is then subjected to ozonolysis.

Wait, stepping back, perhaps the overall plan is:

1. Convert the ethynylcyclohexane into a substituted alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne into an alkene.

3. Subject the alkene to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Perform some kind of elimination or oxidation to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, which suggests that somewhere a carbonyl group is formed.

Option B's step 3 is O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps in option B, after some steps, an alkene is formed, then ozonolysis is used to form carbonyl groups.

Putting it all together:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, the first step is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, which would form a longer alkyne.

Then, the second step is Li in liquid NH3. What does that do? Maybe it's a reduction or deprotonation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotection.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is also used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used for the formation of a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used as a strong base to induce elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, after the first step (NaNH2 and ethyl chloride), the structure is ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et. Then, Li in NH3 might induce elimination, removing a proton to form a double bond.

So, the alkyne might become an alkene. So, after step 2, we have an alkene.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would be broken into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the target is a single molecule, so perhaps the ozonolysis fragment is then reconnected in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis creates a diketone or a dialdehyde, which is then reduced or undergoes other reactions.

Wait, but in option B, after ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH. That's a workup step, perhaps hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis is followed by reductive workup, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then undergoes ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups, and then some kind of protection or oxidation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option C's steps are: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: form methylated acetylide. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd-C. So, hydrogenate the triple bond. Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically convert it into a single bond. So, triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (C-C), adding four hydrogens. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would give a butyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, perhaps the hydrogenation converts the alkyne into a cis or trans double bond. Because if you hydrogenate a triple bond with Lindlar's catalyst, you get cis addition. If you use Na/NH3, you get trans. But in this option, it's H2 and Pd-C, which would probably hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond.

So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with four hydrogens added. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis in the presence of (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis of a single bond? No, ozonolysis typically acts on double bonds. Oh wait, but in this case, after hydrogenation, the triple bond is now a single bond. So, the molecule is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but if that's the case, then ozonolysis wouldn't have anything to act on. So, that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps my understanding of the reagents is off. Let me think again.

Option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, maybe that's a hydrogenation of a triple bond to a cis double bond.

Wait, but H2 and Pd typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. Unless the catalyst is poisoned. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me think: The type of catalyst determines the degree of hydrogenation. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst (Pd with quinoline and BaSO4) would hydrogenate an alkyne to a cis-alkene. Sodium in ammonia would give a trans-alkene.

So, if in step 2 of option C, the catalyst is Pd-calcium carbonate, perhaps that's a different condition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation to an alkene.

Wait, but H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, maybe the product after step 2 is a single bond.

But then, how would that help form the target molecule, which has an aldehyde and an alcohol group?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider other options.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated to form an acetylide (CH2-C≡C⁻ Na+), and then reacts with methanol. Methanol is CH3OH. So, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methanol, leading to the substitution of the OH group. But acetylides are strong bases, so perhaps they deprotonate methanol to form the alkoxide, which then attacks the acetylide.

Wait, but the acetylide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, perhaps it would displace the methanol's proton, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol in a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: the acetylide (CH2-C≡C⁻) reacts with methanol via an alkylation. So, CH3-O- could act as a methylating agent. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is protonated by the methanol, but that would just give the original alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the methanol's oxygen attacks the acetylide carbon, but that doesn't make much sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me think about the overall target and see if I can find a plan.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group and an alcohol group attached to a cyclohexane. The substituent on the cyclohexane is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: consider that the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and the target has an aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde.

One way to convert an alkyne into an aldehyde is via oxidation. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne can yield diketones, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, could oxidize the alkyne to a carboxylic acid, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, which is then oxidized. Or perhaps it's used in a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an enolate, which then undergoes some alkylation or aldehyde formation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think about the steps needed to form the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Let me imagine that the ethynyl group is used to form a ring. So, perhaps the triple bond is used for a ring-forming reaction, such as forming a cyclopropane via [2+2] cycloaddition or another process. But I'm not sure if that's applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a cyclohexenyl group via some kind of ring expansion.

Wait, getting back to the options, perhaps option D makes more sense. Let me think:

Option D: steps are (1) NaNH2, methanol; (2) Li in liq. NH3; (3) O3/(CH3)2S; (4) NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. As before, perhaps this forms a methyl ether or some other substitution.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. So, the acetylide (CH2-C≡C⁻) might react with methanol in a substitution, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide acts as a base, abstracting a proton from methanol to form CH3O⁻, which then attacks something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is CH2-C≡C⁻ + CH3OH → CH2-C≡C-OCH3. But that would form an ether.

Wait, but that would create a methyl ether group on the acetylide. Then, in step 2, Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent. Maybe it reduces the triple bond to a single bond, or perhaps it induces some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used to form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation, creating a strong base which could lead to elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, after step 1, if we have CH2-C≡C-OCH3, then Li in NH3 might deprotonate the triple bond again, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 reduces the triple bond to a single bond. So, the alkyne becomes a single bond with Li adding hydrogens.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is often used to reduce aromatic rings (Birch reduction), but perhaps here it's used to hydrogenate the alkyne.

If the alkyne is reduced to an alkane, then step 3 is ozonolysis. But that would require a double bond, which we don't have here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about this incorrectly. Let me consider each step in option D more carefully.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with a strong base would form the acetylide ion. Then, reacting with methanol. Methanol is a nucleophile but not a strong one. So, perhaps the acetylide (a strong base) would deprotonate methanol, forming CH3O⁻, which could then attack something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe this step forms a methyl-substituted acetylide.

Wait, perhaps the acetylide (CH2-C≡C⁻) reacts with CH3OH. So, CH2-C≡C⁻ + CH3OH → ?

But I'm not certain about the mechanism here. Maybe it's an alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methanol, leading to CH2-C≡C-OCH3. But that's an ether formation, which doesn't seem directly useful for the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is protonated by the methanol, giving CH2-C≡C-H and methanol as the byproduct, but that doesn't change anything.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target molecule's structure again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a methyl group attached to both the main cyclohexane and another cyclohexane, with an OH group.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is used to form a larger ring via a ring expansion, incorporating another cyclohexane unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a dihydroxy group, which then is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about each reagent's purpose.

Looking at option C: after the first two steps (NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-CaCO3), the product would have a CH2 group attached to a methyl group. Then, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond, but if there's no double bond, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option C is adding a methyl group to the alkyne, making it CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation (step 2) would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about how the target molecule can be formed.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of alkylation and oxidation.

Maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a hydroxyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first hydrogenated to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used in a hydration reaction to form an enol, which could then be oxidized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone. For example, using a hydroboration reaction to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to hydroboration to form a carbonyl group. For example, using BH3 followed by oxidation could form a ketone. But I'm not sure if that's applicable to terminal alkynes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the reagents for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a Grignard reaction to form a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to think of each option's overall effect.

Option C: After step 1 (adding methyl chloride), the alkyne becomes longer. Step 2 hydrogenates it to a single bond. Step 3 ozonolysis, but without a double bond, nothing happens. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base used for elimination or for the treatment of epoxides.

Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li in NH3, then ozonolysis, then NH4OH.

So, perhaps step 1 is making an ether, step 2 is reducing the alkyne to an alkene, step 3 is ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and step 4 is workup.

Wait, but Li in NH3 is used for reductions, like the Birch reduction, but in this case, maybe it's used to reduce the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the first step is making an ether, then the alkyne is reduced to an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the correct answer and see which option aligns.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. But how do we get the primary alcohol?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via an oxidation of a primary alkene.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group that also has an OH. So, perhaps the methyl group is formed via a Grignard reaction or a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used in a way to form a cyclopropane ring, which is then opened to form the substituent.

Wait, considering the initial structure, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. If that's subjected to a reaction that forms a cyclopropane, like using a dihalide and a base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with any of the reagents listed.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, and then undergoes some kind of addition.

Hmm, another approach: think about each option's final steps.

Option B ends with NH4OH after ozonolysis. That's a basic workup, perhaps for forming amines or alcohols.

Option C ends with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, used in elimination reactions or for the treatment of epoxides.

Option D ends with NH4OH, perhaps as a neutralizing agent.

The target molecule has an aldehyde and an alcohol group. So, perhaps one step forms the aldehyde, and another forms the alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction sequence involves forming an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups (like aldehyde or ketone), and another step forms the alcohol.

So, looking at option C, after ozonolysis (step 3), which would form carbonyl groups, and then Ba(OH)2 (step 4), perhaps for elimination or for forming rings.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to form a diol from an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should consider which reagents are likely to form the necessary groups.

The target has an aldehyde, which could be formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis of an alkene, which would break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

So, in that case, the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then ozonolyzed to form an aldehyde.

So, let's see which option includes ozonolysis.

Options B, C, and D include ozonolysis.

In option B, step 3 is ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH.

In option C, step 3 is ozonolysis, step 4 is Ba(OH)2.

In option D, step 3 is ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH.

So, perhaps the correct option uses ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how do we get the alkene from the alkyne?

In option B, step 2 is Li in liq. NH3, which could possibly reduce the alkyne to an alkene. For example, using Li in NH3 would add a single hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it into a cis or trans alkene, depending on conditions.

Wait, but I thought that Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, which are for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a trans-alkene.

So, the steps in option B: step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, making a longer alkyne (CH2-C≡C-Et). Step 2 is Li in NH3, which reduces the alkyne to an alkene (CH2-CH2-CH2-Et?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a trans-alkene.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target only has one aldehyde group. So, perhaps the alkyne was converted into a longer chain, which upon ozonolysis would form the necessary carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclic structure, which upon ozonolysis would form the aldehyde and the cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, because step 3 is ozonolysis followed by NH4OH, which is a mild workup that would form aldehydes and ketones without further oxidation.

So, putting it all together:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH).

Option D's step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this forms a methyl ether group, creating an acetylide that's then methylated. Or perhaps it's forming a protected alkoxy group.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Perhaps this reduces the alkyne to an alkene, creating a double bond.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into two carbonyl groups, which would form an aldehyde and a ketone, perhaps.

Step 4: NH4OH. Workup, perhaps to form the aldehyde and the alcohol.

But I'm not entirely certain about the exact transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, where after hydrogenation, ozonolysis is used, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl which has an OH. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is used to form a bridge structure, which is then cleaved.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol and oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not making progress. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the steps.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → methylated alkyne (CH2-C≡C-CH3).

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → longer alkyne (CH2-C≡C-Et).

2. Li/liq. NH3 → reduce alkyne to alkene.

3. O3/H2O → cleave into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, after step 2, the alkyne becomes an alkene (CH2-CH2-CH2-Et?), but I'm not sure. Then, ozonolysis would break the alkene into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene is CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, ozonolysis would make two carbonyls. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the last step is Ba(OH)2, which could induce elimination to form a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct, but I'm not entirely sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll try to conclude.

The target requires an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

Option D's steps involve:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms an acetylide and then methylates it, forming an ether.

2. Li in NH3 → reduces the alkyne to an alkene.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup to form aldehyde and alcohol.

So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups, which are then processed into the target.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps option C's steps don't make much sense, so I'll go with option C.

Wait, no, I'm more confident that option C's steps don't align. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C after all.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting more confused. I'll have to make a choice. Based on the steps, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-C≡CH group.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Forms a methylated acetylide.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a butyl group.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or ring formation.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Oxidative cleavage, likely for forming carbonyl groups.

However, this sequence does not clearly explain how the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups are formed in the target molecule. The repeated step 3 is also suspicious.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Forms an ethylated acetylide.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Reduces the alkyne to an alkene.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to form aldehydes and ketones.

This sequence is plausible because the alkyne is converted into an alkene, which undergoes ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. However, the exact formation of the hydroxymethyl group and the cyclohexyl substituent is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Forms a methylated acetylide.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or forming the hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence is logical because the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the formation of the hydroxymethyl group. However, the role of Ba(OH)2 is not entirely clear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Forms an acetylide, possibly leading to an ether.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Reduces the alkyne to an alkene.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to form aldehydes and ketones.

This sequence is similar to Option B but involves methanol in the first step, which could lead to ether formation. However, the exact mechanism for forming the hydroxymethyl group is unclear.

### Conclusion:
Option C appears to be the most plausible sequence. The methylated acetylide is partially hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the formation of the hydroxymethyl group and the cyclohexyl substituent. While uncertainties remain, Option C aligns most closely with the transformations needed to synthesize the target molecule.
