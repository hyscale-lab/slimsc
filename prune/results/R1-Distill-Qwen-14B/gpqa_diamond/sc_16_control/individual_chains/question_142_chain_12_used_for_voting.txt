Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take some wrong turns, but I'll try to correct myself as I go.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are four different points in 3D space, labeled A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states have more complicated density matrices.

Wait, so ρ is given as (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. That looks like it's an equal mixture of the |0> and |1> states. Because each term is multiplied by 1/2, the trace should be 1, which is correct for a density matrix.

But the question is about its geometrical position. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices correspond to points in space. Oh right, for a single qubit, sometimes the state is represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector gives a geometric representation.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit state can be represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a vector in the Bloch sphere with length 1. For mixed states, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in a similar way, but the length is less than or equal to 1.

The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3D vector. When expanded, that would be:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

So, comparing this with the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

Let me compute the given ρ. |0><0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0], [0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 1/2. Now, let's compare this with the general form for ρ in terms of the Bloch vector.

The general form after expansion is:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Comparing this to the given ρ:

The diagonal elements are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. In our case, both diagonal elements are 1/2. So setting them equal:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result, r_z=0.

Now, what about the off-diagonal elements? The given ρ has zeros in the off-diagonal. The general form's off-diagonal elements are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2.

So for the given ρ, the off-diagonal terms are 0. So:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Because real and imaginary parts must be zero. So r_x =0, r_y=0, and r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait. The Bloch vector for a completely mixed state is zero because it's the center of the sphere. Because a completely mixed state can't be expressed as a pure state on the surface, it's in the middle.

So the given ρ must be the completely mixed state, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So its Bloch vector is the origin, (0,0,0).

Looking at the options:

Option C is r=(0,0,0).

Other options: A is (1,1,0)—that's a vector of length sqrt(2), but our r is zero. B is (0,0,1)—that's the |1> state. D is (1,1,1) which would be a longer vector, but our r is zero.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), making it a completely mixed state. For single-qubit systems, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ 
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), we find:

1. The diagonal elements \((1 + r_z)/2\) and \((1 - r_z)/2\) both equal \(1/2\), which implies \(r_z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal elements \((r_x - i r_y)/2\) and \((r_x + i r_y)/2\) are both \(0\), which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector \(r\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a vector of length \(\sqrt{2}\), not the origin.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this represents the pure state \(|1\rangle\).
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this is the origin, corresponding to the completely mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a vector of length \(\sqrt{3}\), not the origin.

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the completely mixed state with Bloch vector \((0, 0, 0)\).
