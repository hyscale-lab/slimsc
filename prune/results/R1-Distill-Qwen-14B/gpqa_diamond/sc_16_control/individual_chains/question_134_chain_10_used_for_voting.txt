Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

Alright, the question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Their volumes and concentrations are provided. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved, right?

Wait, but wait. I think for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately the same because they both release a lot of heat. But wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid but it's diprotic, so maybe that affects things. Oh, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it should dissociate completely.

Wait, but the problem is about mixing these three solutions. So, I need to find out how much acid and base are reacting. Maybe the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution.

Let me break it down. First, each solution's contribution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Concentration is 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. H2SO4: This is sulfuric acid. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+ ions. But wait, does it fully dissociate in solution? I think the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second one not so much. Oh wait, but when calculating neutralization, do we consider both H+ ions? Or just the first one because maybe the second isn't available for neutralization if it's not dissociated.

Wait, maybe in the context of neutralization reactions, both H+ ions are available because the problem assumes complete neutralization. Or perhaps the reaction is considering only the first dissociation for the neutralization, but I'm not sure. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats H2SO4 as providing two H+ ions. I'll have to clarify that.

So, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Concentration is 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so total H+ would be 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is released completely, and the second is released to a lesser extent. But in neutralization, for the sake of calculation, perhaps we consider both H+ ions as available. So maybe for this problem, we'll take both.

Alternatively, maybe the problem only considers the first dissociation. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this. If the problem is asking for the stoichiometric neutralization, perhaps they expect us to count all the H+ ions. So I'll proceed with 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

3. Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Concentration is 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction between acids and bases. The H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

So the total moles of H+ available are 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The moles of OH- available are 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, the H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So the limiting reagent is OH- because 0.2 < 0.28.

So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles unreacted.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, in the neutralization, each mole of OH- neutralizes one mole of H+. So the total H+ from the acids is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

So all OH- will be consumed, leaving 0.08 moles of H+.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the total H+ and OH- available, regardless of the source. So the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each reaction releases heat.

The enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually given per mole of H+ neutralized, and for strong acids and bases, it's approximately -57 kJ/mol (but wait, wait—actually, I think it's around -57 kJ per mole of H+). Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact value. Wait, yes, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but I'm pretty sure that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole for a strong acid and strong base. So each mole of H+ or OH- contributes -57 kJ to the reaction.

But wait, in this problem, the total moles of H+ available is 0.28, but only 0.2 moles of OH- are present to neutralize. So the actual moles of H+ that react is 0.2, right? Because OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the moles of neutralization that occur are 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole. So when it's neutralized, both H+ would contribute to the enthalpy change. But in the case where the OH- is the limiting reagent, perhaps only some of those H+ would get neutralized.

Wait, no. The H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are all in the solution. So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles. So the neutralization reaction would involve 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Which is -11,400 J, or -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, wait, but wait, the units are in kcal or kJ?

Wait, the options are in both kcal and kJ. So I need to make sure which units to use.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization". The options have A and C in kcal, B in kcal, and D in kJ.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is approximately 13.66 kcal (since 1 cal = 4.184 J; 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal).

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Let me think—when I was learning this, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as about -57 kJ per mole, which is about -13.66 kcal per mole. So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (because 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal, since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). Wait, let me compute that: 11.4 kJ * 0.239 kcal/kJ ≈ 2.72 kcal, so the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal.

Hmm, that's option A. But wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72 kcal, but with a negative sign because it's exothermic. So the total enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. If the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ, which is about -13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal. So that would make the answer option A.

But wait, but wait. Let me go back. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. So the reaction is between the H+ and OH-.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-, then find the limiting reagent.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat (exothermic).

The number of moles that react is the minimum of H+ and OH-. So 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

So the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So A and D are possible. But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization when the three solutions are mixed. Do I need to consider the heat released per mole of reaction, or just the total?

Wait, the question is phrased as "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when [solutions] are mixed."

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ (or OH-) neutralized. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ were neutralized, so the total enthalpy released is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, but in this problem, each H+ contributes to the enthalpy change.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information in my head. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). So 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11,400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the total enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which matches option A.

But wait, why is option B there? Option B is -11.42 kcal. That would imply 0.28 moles being neutralized, but OH- is the limiting reagent. So only 0.2 moles are neutralized.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, another thing: the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. Wait, perhaps I should consider all the H+ provided, but only the OH- that's available. So the enthalpy change is based on the moles of OH- reacting, which is 0.2 moles. So the calculation is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the net reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another point: the problem involves mixing H2SO4 (which is a strong acid but diprotic) and a strong base. So, the H+ from H2SO4 would react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but another thought: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it dissociates, each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So, for 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, we get 0.2 moles OH-.

The HCl gives 0.1 moles H+, and H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles H+.

So when we mix the three, the OH- will neutralize H+ from both HCl and H2SO4.

So OH- (0.2 moles) will neutralize 0.2 moles H+.

So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, leading to a ΔH of 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl dissociates completely, providing 1 mole of H⁺ per mole of HCl.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, providing 2 moles of H⁺ per mole of H₂SO₄.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, providing 2 moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

4. **Determine the limiting reagent**:  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   Total moles of H⁺ available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total moles of OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ will react.

5. **Calculate the enthalpy change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ neutralized:  
   \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal:  
   \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated enthalpy change matches option A, \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

**Answer: A**
