Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab frame. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the medium is moving.

So the glass is moving towards the observer. Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Oh wait, no, because the glass is a non-inertial frame? Or is it? Wait, no, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so it's an inertial frame. But I'm considering the speed of light in the glass as observed from the lab frame.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't directly apply velocity addition here because light's speed has some special properties. According to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. But wait, that's in a vacuum. In a medium, things might be different. Oh, this is where things get tricky.

So the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. From the lab frame, the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in my frame. So I need to calculate the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? I think this involves the Doppler effect or relativistic velocity addition. Or maybe it's more about how the medium's motion affects the light's speed.

Wait, another approach: the light's speed in the medium is v = c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, I have to consider how the motion of the medium affects the speed as seen in the lab. So if the medium is moving towards the observer, it might affect the observed speed.

Hmm, let's think in terms of frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v = c/n. But in the lab frame, we have to transform these velocities.

Wait, but velocity addition in special relativity isn't straightforward. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, I'm getting confused because the light's speed in the medium isn't exactly the same as in vacuum.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at speed v_glass = v (the same direction as the light) relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. Wait, that seems contradictory. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and the beam is moving towards the observer, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the direction is towards the observer, and the beam is moving towards the observer, same as the glass.

Wait, no, let me read the question again. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving the same way. So from the lab frame, the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the frame transformation. Let me consider the frame of the glass first. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v (same direction as light) relative to the lab. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up with the signs. Let me define the direction: Let's say the positive x-direction is towards the observer. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, meaning the beam is going towards the observer. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at velocity u' = c/n towards the observer.

Now, to find the velocity u of the light in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' * v)/c²]

Wait, but wait. Because the glass is moving towards the observer (so v is positive), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, light moves at u' = c/n towards the observer, so positive. Then, the lab sees the glass moving at velocity v (positive, same direction as light), and the light in the glass frame is moving at u' = c/n. So in lab frame, the speed would be:

u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' * v)/c² ]

But wait, substituting u' = c/n and v is in the same direction, so v is positive.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate that.

So u' = c/n. Then:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v/(n c)) )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ]

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (c + n v)/n

Denominator: (n c + v)/(n c )

Because 1 = n c/(n c), so 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So now u becomes:

[ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Which is [ (c + n v) /n ] * [ n c/(n c + v) ) ]

The n cancels:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

So,

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But wait, let me factor the denominator. n c + v = v + n c. Let's see if that's the same as (c + ...). Hmm, perhaps it can be factored differently.

Wait, but the problem is that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, but in a moving medium, how does that add up?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. Wait, but that's in the vacuum. In a medium, it's different. Oh, so this is where the confusion arises.

So in the glass medium, the speed is c/n. Now, the medium is moving, so the lab frame sees the light at a different speed. So the velocity addition formula applies here.

Hmm, so going back to the calculation. So after substituting, we have u = [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but the options don't look like that. Let me compute this expression.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the direction again.

Wait another approach: The light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher than when the medium is at rest, because the medium is moving in the same direction as the light.

Wait, that makes sense. So the speed would be higher than c/n. Hmm, but the options don't all have c as a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the speed of light in the medium is still c, but that's only in vacuum. Wait, but in the medium, the speed is c/n.

But wait, if the medium is moving, perhaps it's the medium's speed that adds to the light's speed. But that's probably not correct because of relativity.

Wait, maybe I should consider the velocity transformation correctly. Let me re-derive the velocity addition formula correctly.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c² )

In this case, u' is the speed of light in the medium's frame, which is c/n. And v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab. So, substituting:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which becomes:

[ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator and numerator cancel:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

So,

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c (n) + v = n c + v.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

We can factor numerator and denominator by c:

= [ c (c + n v) ] / [ c (n) + v ]

Wait, but that doesn't seem to directly help. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 1. That would imply u = c, but that's only possible if the expression equals c.

Wait, let me see. If I set u = c, then:

c = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

c (n c + v ) = c (c + n v )

Which simplifies to:

n c² + c v = c² + c n v

Divide both sides by c:

n c + v = c + n v 

Which would require:

n c - c = n v - v 

c (n-1) = v (n -1 )

If n ≠1, then c = v, which isn't the case, so unless n=1, which would make the denominator and numerator both zero. Hmm, n=1 would imply vacuum, but the problem is about glass, which has n>1. So this suggests that option B is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Because the velocity addition formula applies to objects, not to the speed of light in a medium. Hmm. Maybe the approach is incorrect because the medium's motion affects the refractive index experienced by the light.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the moving medium is different. Wait, maybe I should think about the medium moving, so the light's speed changes. I've heard before that in a medium, the speed of light depends on the frame. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The refractive index of a medium is defined in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium is moving, the refractive index could change. Hmm, but I don't remember the exact effect. Maybe the refractive index depends on the relative motion between the medium and the observer.

Wait, but I think in this problem, we're to treat the refractive index n as the rest frame value. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the refractive index is still n. So the speed of light in the glass is v = c/n, but the movement of the glass affects how this speed is observed in the lab.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light's speed in the glass is v = c/n, but the lab would see the light moving at a different speed due to the glass's motion.

Wait, but I'm back to the same velocity addition approach.

So perhaps the correct formula is [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Which simplifies to [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]

As I did earlier.

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmmm. Let me see if I can simplify this expression further.

Let me factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: c (1 + (n v)/c )

Denominator: c (n ) + v = c (n + v/c )

Wait, that doesn't help much.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of small v compared to c. Then, n v would be negligible compared to c. So the expression would approach c/n, which makes sense. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, if v is significant, the expression would change.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option B is 1, implying u = c, which as I saw earlier isn't correct except when certain conditions are met.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the speed of light in the medium is c/n, and since the medium is moving at velocity v, the speed of light as observed in the lab would be (c/n) + v. But that's just the Galilean addition, which isn't correct at high speeds.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so perhaps that's not the approach.

Wait, another angle: The speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. So in the rest frame of the medium, the light is moving at v. When the medium moves at velocity u (v in this case), the lab frame would measure the light's speed as (v + u) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again: in the medium's frame, light is moving at c/n. The medium is moving at velocity v (same direction as light) in the lab frame. So using the velocity addition formula, the lab would measure the light's speed as (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v )/c² )

Which simplifies to ( (c + n v ) /n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Which is the same as before.

So, u = [c (c + n v ) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm. Let's compute this:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: v + n c = same as above.

Wait, perhaps factor out n from denominator:

Denominator: n (c) + v = n c + v.

Not helping.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as:

u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1/c:

u = [ c + n v ] / (n + v/c )

Hmm, but again, it's not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me see the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Option B: 1

Option C: (1 + n v)/(n - v )

Option D: (1 - n v)/(n + v )

Hmm, none of these directly match [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but if I let c=1 (as given in the problem), the expression simplifies.

So, substituting c=1 into u:

u = [ (1 + n v ) ] / (n + v )

Which is option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Wait, that's exactly option A.

So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. When I substituted c=1, the expression becomes (1 + n v) / (n + v ), which is option A. So the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab, is (1 + n v)/(n + v ) when c=1.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in a glass medium relative to an observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Medium**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( v_{\text{medium}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass and \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

2. **Relative Motion of the Medium**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

3. **Substitute \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) into the Formula**:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   1 + \frac{v}{n c}
   \]
   Thus, the expression becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression**:
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to eliminate the fraction in the denominator:
   \[
   u = \frac{(c + n v) c}{n c + v}
   \]
   Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Match with the Options**: Comparing this result with the given options, we see that it matches **Option A**:
   \[
   \text{Option A: } \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).
