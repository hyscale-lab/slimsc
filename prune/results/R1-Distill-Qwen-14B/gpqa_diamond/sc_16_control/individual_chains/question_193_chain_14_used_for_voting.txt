Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that astronomers observed the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I remember is distance d = 1 / plx, but wait, I think it's in parsecs. So if the parallax is smaller, the distance is larger.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, we need to find dN/dr, or the change in number of stars per unit distance.

Let me think about the relationship. Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, because plx = 1/d (parallax in arcseconds and d in parsecs). So substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, so the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance? Does that make sense? I'm a bit confused because usually, the number of stars you can see might decrease with distance because they're fainter. But wait, this is about how the count varies with distance, so it's more about the distribution.

Wait, no, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then for each increase in d, the number of stars increases by a factor of d^5. But wait, the options are in terms of how N changes with r (distance). Oh wait, let me define r as the distance. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the options give the answer as a function of r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N per unit distance (the derivative, maybe) would be proportional to dN/dr = 5 r^4. Wait, no, wait. The question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So they're asking for dN/dr, which is the rate of change.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, this becomes N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But how does the number change with distance? If you go from d to d+Δd, the number increases by a factor of (d+Δd)^5 - d^5. But that's approximately 5d^4 Δd for small Δd. So the rate of change, dN/dr, is 5 k d^4. But the question is about the dependence on r, so dN/dr is proportional to r^4. Because 5d^4 is the same as r^4 multiplied by a constant. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the answer would be option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not messing up the steps. Another approach: express N as a function of distance. N(r) = C * (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N(r) = C * (d)^5. So N(r) = C r^5. Now, to find the change in N with distance, we're looking for dN/dr. The derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4, which is option C.

So the correct answer should be C, which is ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the relationship, \( N \propto \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{d})^5} = d^5 \). Thus, \( N \propto d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we compute the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \), where \( r \) is the distance.

Therefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as \( r^4 \), corresponding to option C.
