Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the allowed decay modes for this boson X. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh right, I think it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So, the interaction is between the boson X and fermions ψ_f. The fermions are in the fundamental representation, so they must be charged particles.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into at the lowest order. So, kinematically allowed decays depend on the energy (mass of X) being at least twice the mass of the fermions involved, right? Because each fermion pair would take some energy, and the rest would be kinetic.

So first, I should list all the possible fermions that the X boson can couple to. Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction is between X and ψ_f. The term is something like X ψ_f ψ_f, which suggests that X is a scalar (since it's not in the covariant derivative or something else). Wait, if X is a boson, and the interaction term is X ψ ψ, that would imply that X is a scalar boson, right? Because spin considerations would require that the interaction term's spin is zero. So X is a scalar, like maybe a Higgs-like particle.

Now, the Lagrangian term looks a bit like Yukawa coupling. The general form for Yukawa interactions is L = -g ψ ψ X, but in this case, it's written as (ῡ + X) ψ. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the interaction term being X ψ ψ. So the vertex is X ψ ψ. So each decay would be X → ψ ψ̄, right?

So the decay X → f f̄ would require that the fermion f has a mass m_f ≤ M_X / 2. That's because each fermion would take at least m_f, so 2m_f ≤ M_X.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's list all the possible fermions and their masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV, so M_X is 6 GeV, which is less than 2 * 173 GeV, so can't decay into top quarks.

Other fermions:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: super light, but I think they're negligible here.

Wait, but wait! The problem is about the interaction given by the Lagrangian. The term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the fermion types. Wait, maybe the ψ_f represents different fermion species. So the interaction is for each fermion type f, the X couples to that fermion. So X can decay into any fermion f and its antiparticle, provided the mass allows it.

But wait, the term is written as -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps it's more about the Yukawa coupling, but maybe the interaction is between X and fermions of a specific type. Alternatively, perhaps the f is a flavor index, and the interaction is for each flavor.

Wait, perhaps I should think that each fermion f (like up, down, strange, etc.) can interact with X. So X can decay into any of these fermion-antifermion pairs, provided that the mass is sufficient.

So, now, let's compute which fermions are allowed.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV must be >= 2 * m_f.

Let's list the possible fermions and their masses:

Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV → 2m_e <<6 GeV → allowed.

Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV → 2*105.7 ≈ 211 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → 2*1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

Quarks:

u: ~2.2 MeV → 4.4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

d: ~4.7 MeV → ~9.4 MeV → allowed.

s: ~95 MeV → ~190 MeV → allowed.

c: ~1.3 GeV → 2.6 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄.

t: way too heavy, as before.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-,

u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but wait what about the charged leptons and quarks? Do they have to be in pairs that sum to a charge that allows the decay? For example, X is neutral, right? Because the coupling is X ψ ψ, so the X must be neutral. So the fermion pair must be neutral as well. So, for example, X can decay into a lepton and antilepton (like e+ e-), or quark and antiquark (u ū, etc.), because those pairs are neutral.

So the possible decay modes are into these pairs.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ-, e+ e-. Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So decay into b b̄ is not allowed. So option A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-. So c is 1.3 GeV → 2.6 GeV <6 GeV. So this is allowed. s, u, d also allowed. τ is allowed. μ and e allowed. But what about the quarks: does the X couple to all quarks? The interaction is for each ψ_f, which would be each type of quark and lepton. So the X can decay into any of these as long as the mass allows.

Wait, but the problem statement says the interaction is given for ψ_f, so the X can couple to any fermion ψ_f, which includes all quarks and leptons. So the allowed decays are into all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

e+, e- → allowed.

μ+, μ- → allowed.

τ+, τ- → allowed.

u, ū → allowed.

d, d̄ → allowed.

s, s̄ → allowed.

c, c̄ → allowed.

b, b̄ → not allowed (since 2*4.5=9>6).

t, t̄ → way too big, not allowed.

So the decay options are into these: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, τ, μ, e. So all except b and t are included. So option B is correct? But wait, let's check the options.

Option B says: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. So that's all except the bottom quark, which is correct.

But wait, what about the other options?

Option C includes t t̄ which is impossible, so C is out.

Option D: includes b, so no.

Option A includes b, which is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the interaction is given by L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the interaction. Wait, the term is more like λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So that would be λ f ψ_f ψ_f + λ f X ψ_f ψ_f. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. No, that can't be right because that would imply a term like ψ_f ψ_f, which is ψ^2. For a fermion field, ψ ψ would be a dimension 4 operator, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the interaction term. The interaction term is X ψ_f ψ_f. So X is a scalar, and the interaction is between X and two fermions ψ_f. So the vertex is X ψ_f ψ_f. So the decay X → ψ_f ψ_f̄? No, wait, ψ_f is a Dirac spinor, so the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that the X couples to a fermion and an antifermion? Wait, no, because in the term, it's X ψ_f ψ_f, but wait, that would be X (ψ_f)^2. But since ψ_f is a spinor, ψ_f^2 would be a scalar. So the interaction term is X times ψ_f squared. Hmm, that's possible. But wait, in that case, the vertex would be X ψ ψ, which would imply that the X couples to two fermions of the same type. So in that case, the decay would be X → f f̄.

Wait, but for a fermion and antifermion, the term would be X ψ_f ψ_f̄, right? Because ψ_f is a spinor, and ψ_f̄ is its adjoint. So perhaps the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f̄, which is the standard Yukawa coupling.

In that case, the vertex is X f f̄, which is what I originally thought. So each decay is X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. So the mass of the fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV (since 6 GeV is M_X, so 2 m_f ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV).

Wait, no, wait: 2 m_f must be ≤ M_X, so m_f ≤ M_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses ≤3 GeV?

Looking:

e: 0.5 MeV → yes.

μ: ~105 MeV → yes.

τ: 1.78 GeV → yes.

u: 2.2 MeV → yes.

d: ~4.7 MeV → yes.

s: ~95 MeV → yes.

c: ~1.3 GeV → yes.

b: 4.5 GeV → no.

t: 173 GeV → no.

So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So the decay products allowed are:

e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Which matches option B.

But let's check the options again. Option B is X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. So that's all the allowed ones except the b, which is excluded because m_b is 4.5 GeV, leading to 2 m_b=9 GeV >6 GeV.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

From the Lagrangian, it is evident that the boson \( X \) interacts with fermions \( \psi_f \), and the interaction term implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) at the lowest order. The kinematic constraint for such decays is that the mass of \( X \) must satisfy:

\[
M_X \geq 2m_f,
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). For \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
The masses of known fermions are approximately:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

Using the constraint \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), the allowed fermions are:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because their masses exceed \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Allowed Decay Modes
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u \bar{u} \)
- \( d \bar{d} \)
- \( s \bar{s} \)
- \( c \bar{c} \)

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay modes of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
