Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is split into its components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in an arbitrary direction is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The general form for the spin operator along a direction n is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So the operator P here must be the spin operator. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n must be zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz). And since it's a direction, nx^2 + nz^2 = 1. But wait, the exact direction isn't given, so the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of angles θ and φ. Wait, but φ is the angle in the x-y plane, right? Since n is in the x-z plane, φ would be either 0 or π, depending on the direction. Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is measured in the x-y plane. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180 degrees. Actually, maybe the direction is given in terms of polar angles θ, where θ is measured from the z-axis.

So the components of n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component sinθ sinφ is zero. So sinθ sinφ = 0. That implies either sinθ=0 or sinφ=0. If sinθ=0, then θ=0 or π, but that would place n along the z-axis. Alternatively, sinφ=0, so φ=0 or π. So n is either in the x-z plane, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Wait, but if φ is zero, then n is along the x and z. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since φ=0 would make cosφ=1 and sinφ=0.

So the spin operator P along n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Because the σ matrices are 2x2, each component contributes. So the operator P can be written as:

P = (ħ/2) [ (n_x) σ_x + (n_z) σ_z ]

But wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting the given P components, let's see:

Wait, the problem gives P_x as (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y (because σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]), and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the total operator P in the direction n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So P = (n_x)(ħ/2 σ_x) + (n_z)(ħ/2 σ_z) = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is called vec P. So the operator along direction n is the vector operator dotted with the direction vector. So yeah, that's correct.

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait no, wait. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So the equation is [ (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Dividing both sides by ħ/2 gives (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix for this operator is n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z. Let me compute that.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], and n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together gives the matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±1 because the determinant would be (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x^2) = -(n_z^2) - n_x^2. Wait, but wait, the determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x^2) → -n_z² - n_x². But since n_z² + n_x² =1 (because it's a unit vector), the determinant is -1. The trace is n_z - n_z = 0. The eigenvalues are sqrt(trace^2/4 - determinant) → sqrt(0 - (-1)) → sqrt(1) → ±1. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So when we multiply by ħ/2, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which matches the question.

So we need the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +1 (since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which comes from multiplying by ħ/2). So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = (+1) |v>

So the equations:

n_z v1 + n_x v2 = v1,

n_x v1 - n_z v2 = v2.

Wait, wait, let me write it out:

Equation 1: (n_z) v1 + (n_x) v2 = v1

Equation 2: (n_x) v1 + (-n_z) v2 = v2

Rearranging equation 1: (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0.

Equation 2: n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

So we have two equations:

1) (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0,

2) n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

We can write this as a system:

a v1 + b v2 = 0,

b v1 + c v2 = 0,

where a = (n_z -1), b = n_x, c = (-n_z -1).

Wait, but for a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

The determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = [ -n_z² -n_z + n_z +1 ] - n_x² = [ -n_z² +1 ] - n_x².

But n_z² + n_x² =1, so [ - (n_z² + n_x²) + 1 ] = [ -1 +1 ] =0. So the determinant is zero, which makes sense since we're finding eigenvectors.

So we can pick one equation to solve. Let's take equation 1:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0 → v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] v2.

Alternatively, equation 2:

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0 → v1 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] v2.

Wait, but these two expressions for v1 must be consistent. Let's see:

From equation 1: v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] v2.

From equation 2: v1 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] v2.

Setting them equal:

[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ]

Cross-multiplying:

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

→ -n_x^2 = n_z² -1.

But since n_x² + n_z² =1,

n_z² = 1 - n_x².

So substituting:

- n_x^2 = (1 - n_x²) -1 → -n_x² = -n_x² → 0=0.

Which is always true, so the two equations are consistent.

So let's pick a parameterization. Let's set v2 =1, then express v1 in terms of v2.

From equation 1: v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] *1.

But perhaps it's easier to parameterize in terms of angles. Since n is in the x-z plane, n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). But earlier, we determined that φ is 0 or π. Let me assume φ=0 for simplicity, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the matrix becomes [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

The eigenvector equation for eigenvalue +1:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [v1; v2] = [v1; v2].

So the equations:

cosθ v1 + sinθ v2 = v1 → (cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 =0,

sinθ v1 - cosθ v2 = v2 → sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1 ) v2 =0.

Let me write equation 1:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 =0.

Let me solve for v2 in terms of v1.

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Similarly, from equation 2:

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0 → v2 = [ sinθ / (cosθ +1) ] v1.

So for v2, both expressions must be equal:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = sinθ/(cosθ +1).

Let me check this:

(1 - cosθ) (cosθ +1) = (1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ.

So numerator on left is (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) = sin²θ.

Denominator on left is sinθ.

So left side is sin²θ / sinθ = sinθ.

Right side is sinθ / (1 + cosθ) * (1 + cosθ) → sinθ.

So both expressions give the same v2 in terms of v1, which is consistent.

So let's pick v1 as a parameter. Let’s say v1 = A, then v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] A.

But wait, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ can be written as tan(θ/2). Because:

1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2),

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2),

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] = tan(θ/2).

So v2 = tan(θ/2) * v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(θ/2)].

But we need to normalize it. The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

Assuming v1 is real (since the eigenvector is real here?), let's proceed.

v2 = tan(theta/2) * v1.

So |v1|^2 + [ tan(theta/2) * v1 ]^2 =1.

Factor v1^2: v1^2 [ 1 + tan²(theta/2) ] =1 → v1^2 [ sec²(theta/2) ] =1 → v1^2 = cos²(theta/2).

So v1 = cos(theta/2), since it's positive (assuming the state is positive), and v2 = sin(theta/2).

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so v2 = tan(theta/2) v1 → v2 = [sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v1 = cos(theta/2),

v2 = sin(theta/2).

So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, but that doesn't seem right because our components are normalized.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The operator is expressed in terms of ħ/2, but the eigenvector is a unit vector. So the components are just the normalized coefficients, without any ħ factors.

Looking back at the problem statement, the options include hbar in their elements, which seems odd because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are states, not operators). Wait, but the options are given as elements of the normalized eigenvector. So if the components have ħ, that can't be correct because the eigenvector should be dimensionless. So perhaps I made a mistake, or maybe the options have an error.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The eigenvector components are dimensionless. So options A, B, D have terms with ħ, which doesn't make sense. Only option C has terms without ħ.

Wait, but let me look back at the problem statement. It says, "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the eigenvector should be normalized, which we have done. So our conclusion for the components is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the overall phase doesn't matter, but sometimes the state can have an exponential factor. For example, when you rotate into a different basis, you might get a phase factor. But since the eigenvector is being normalized, and the problem doesn't specify any particular phase, the answer would just be in terms of cosine and sine.

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenvector we've found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But let's consider the possibility of a global phase. For example, if you multiply by e^{i phi}, but since the eigenvector equation is linear, any global phase would still satisfy the equation, so it's arbitrary. However, when you write the components, you can choose the phase to be zero. So the answer would be option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so its components are $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z).
\]
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}$, we get:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} (n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:
\[
(n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
\]
The matrix representation of $n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z$ is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalue equation becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 + (-n_z - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]
These equations are consistent, and solving for $v_1$ and $v_2$ in terms of $n_x$ and $n_z$ gives the eigenvector components. Using the parametrization $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane), the eigenvector components are:
\[
v_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad v_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]
The eigenvector is normalized, as:
\[
|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = \cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Examining the options, this matches option C. The other options either include extraneous factors of $\hbar$ (which are inconsistent with normalized eigenvectors) or describe unphysical forms.
