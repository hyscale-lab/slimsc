Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out why the protein isn't being expressed. Let's think about what could go wrong. The options given are A, B, C, D.

First, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. The question is looking for a problem in the construct that prevents proper expression.

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA sequence. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation, maybe the tag isn't recognized, but that might not prevent expression entirely. It could affect purification but not necessarily the expression levels.

Option B: Ribosome termination early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream or in the wrong place. Let me check the sequence for in-frame stop codons before the intended stop.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. Without a linker, maybe the protein isn't stable. Proteases could degrade it. But this would probably lead to lower or no detection, but maybe the construct isn't expressed much.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for it, then the stop codon wouldn't be recognized. Wait, but the construct is in the mouse, so the translation machinery is mouse's. If the construct has a stop codon that's not recognized, the protein could be longer or not terminate. But looking at the sequence, is there a stop codon in the correct frame?

Wait, let's look at the DNA sequence. Let me find the stop codon. The sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. Let's see the last few codons. TGA is the stop codon in DNA? Wait, DNA is read as complementary, so the mRNA would have UAA. So in the DNA, the stop codon is TGA (since DNA is complementary to mRNA). So the DNA sequence ends with TGA, which is the stop codon.

Wait, but the option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. So mouse cells have the machinery to recognize UAA as a stop codon, right? All standard stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are recognized. So D might not be the issue.

Now, looking for possible stop codons in the DNA sequence before the intended end. Let me scan the plus strand for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let's see:

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG, then continues. Let's look for any TGA, TAG, TAA in the reading frame.

Wait, let's check the entire plus strand. Let's look for any in-frame stop codons. For instance, after the ATG start, the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), etc. Are there any TAG, TGA, or TAA in the same frame?

Wait, let me parse the sequence. Since the plus strand is the coding strand, the mRNA would be complementary. So the DNA's coding strand is same as mRNA, except T instead of U.

So the mRNA would be:

AUG ... (various codons) ... UAA at the end.

So the mRNA ends with ... UAA.

So the DNA has TGA as the stop codon. So the translation should terminate there.

But wait, looking again, in the DNA construct, the sequence after the HA tag is the GADD45G coding sequence. Let me check if there's another stop codon earlier.

Let me look for any TGA, TAG, TAA. Let me go through the sequence:

From the start, ATG, then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), etc. Let me count in triplets.

Positions 1-3: ATG (Met)
4-6: TAC (Tyr)
7-9: CCA (Pro)
10-12: TCG (Ser)
13-15: ATG (Met)
16-18: CCAG (Wait, that's the 4th codon, which is CCAG? Wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me try to split the sequence into triplets.

But wait, the sequence is quite long; maybe I should look for any occurrence of TGA, TAG, TAA in the correct frame.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the issue is that the stop codon is in the wrong frame, but that's unlikely because the sequence is designed properly. Alternatively, maybe the presence of a premature stop codon in the reading frame.

Looking for any triplet that's TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let's go through the sequence:

Looking for these triplets:

- ATG ... then TAC, CCA, TCG, ATG, etc.

Wait, maybe somewhere in the middle. Let me check a few points.

Looking around the middle: For example, the sequence has "GATGTTCCAGATTACGCCA". Let me break into triplets:

GAT Gtt cca tag tgc cca ... Hmm, wait, the triplet 'att' would be part of a codon. Wait, wait, looking for TGA in the DNA plus strand. So in the DNA plus strand, any triplet TGA, TAG, or TAA?

Looking at the sequence:

... GTG GTT CCG GAA AGC ... 

Wait somewhere else:

Looking for TGA: let's see...

A few positions in: CTG GAAGAAGTCGC. Hmm.

Further down: TTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCC...

Wait, here's a part that says 'GTCG', but triplets would be GTC and then G.

Wait, perhaps I'm not finding any other TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame. So the only in-frame stop is the final TGA.

Wait, another thought: the inserted HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA tag's sequence has a stop codon in frame, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Let me check the HA sequence.

Influenza HA is a glycoprotein. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYA, but in the DNA construct, the HA tag is added as a coding sequence. So the coding sequence for HA should be in frame with the GADD45G.

If the HA sequence in the construct has a stop codon, that would cause the protein to be truncated. But the question says that the sequence is introduced for the HA determinant. So suppose the HA sequence had a stop codon, maybe the construct would terminate early.

Looking at the DNA sequence before the start of GADD45G. The first part is the HA tag, then GADD45G.

Wait, the beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Wait, the first few codons are:

ATG (start) = Met.

Then TAC = Tyr.

CCA = Pro.

TAC = Tyr.

GAT = Asp.

GTT = Val.

CCA = Pro.

GAT = Asp.

TAC = Tyr.

GCC = Ala.

AAA = Lys.

TGA = stop.

Wait a minute, after the HA tag, the construct continues with GADD45G. But in this sequence, after the HA coding, the next codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the HA coding would be followed by a stop.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. So the sequence would be HA followed by GADD45G. But in the given sequence, after the HA (presumably), the next codon is TGA, which is a stop. So that would mean the HA is followed by a stop, so the ribosome would terminate after the HA, meaning no GADD45G is made.

So the issue is that within the coding sequence, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, so the protein doesn't get made beyond that. Therefore, the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G isn't, leading to no overexpression.

So the problem is that the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, which would terminate translation early. So the answer is B: the ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but in the given sequence, where is the HA? Let me see. The initial part: the sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). That's after the HA. Wait, but this is the coding sequence. So the HA is the first part, but if the HA is followed by a stop, then the protein would terminate after the HA, meaning no GADD45G is made.

So the construct would produce a small HA peptide, but nothing else. Hence, no overexpression of GADD45G.

Therefore, the problem is a premature stop codon. Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would fit, because the stop codon is in the middle of the coding sequence.

Alternatively, option C: no linker causing proteolysis. But in this case, the protein isn't even made because the stop codon is encountered.

So the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein in a mouse model by introducing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The provided DNA sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The issue lies in the DNA sequence provided.

Upon analyzing the sequence, it is evident that after the HA tag, there is a premature stop codon (TGA) in the reading frame. This stop codon terminates translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. The premature stop codon disrupts the production of the protein entirely, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

Option A (missense mutation in the HA sequence) is unlikely because a mutation in the HA tag would not necessarily prevent the expression of the full-length protein. Option C (lack of a linker causing proteolysis) is also unlikely because proteolysis would degrade the protein after it was expressed, but in this case, the protein is not being expressed at all due to the premature stop codon. Option D (absence of a tRNA for UAA) is incorrect because mouse cells recognize UAA as a stop codon, and the issue here is the premature stop codon in the construct, not the translation machinery.

The correct explanation is that the premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein.
