Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Right, so in a vacuum, gas molecules don't collide much because there are so few of them.

The scenario is that Mike has a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But despite that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculated the mean free path λ1 based on the current conditions—volume, pressure, and temperature.

Now, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that's not changing. The question is why λ2 isn't the same as λ1.

Wait, what factors affect the mean free path? The main ones are pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions. Oh right, the formula for mean free path λ is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and P is pressure.

So in this case, the pressure in the sample compartment is really low, but not zero. When Mike starts the electron beam, what changes? Well, the electron beam has a high energy, which might cause electron scattering with the gas molecules. But wait, how does that affect the mean free path?

Oh wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, it ionizes the gas molecules. If the gas molecules become charged, they might interact differently. Or perhaps the beam's presence somehow affects the gas, causing more collisions or altering the effective pressure.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is the same, so why would the mean free path change? Unless other factors come into play. Oh, maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure by ionizing the gas. Or perhaps the temperature changes, but the question says temperature remains the same.

Another angle: Mean free path in electron microscopy can also be influenced by electron scattering. The mean free path for electrons is different from the gas molecules' mean free path. Wait, maybe the question is mixing up the two.

Wait, the question says Mike determined λ1 based on the gas particles, but when the electron beam is on, he's looking at the electron scattering. So the mean free path λ2 is for the electrons, not the gas molecules. Oh wait, that might be a different thing.

Wait, no, the question says that the mean free path is based on the electron scattering. So when the beam is on, the electrons are more likely to interact with the gas molecules. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the electrons is what's changing. Because when Mike starts the electron beam, the electrons are now present and moving through the gas. So the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) would be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1), because the electrons can collide more with the gas, so their path is shorter.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was for the gas molecules, and when the beam is on, perhaps the electrons are the ones getting scattered. So the mean free path for the electrons would be λ2. But how does that relate to λ1?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of electron scattering. The presence of gas molecules increases the scattering of electrons. So if the mean free path for electrons is λ2, a shorter λ2 would mean more scattering (because the electrons don't travel far before scattering), so the image quality would degrade.

But the question is about λ2 in comparison to λ1. Let me think about the factors. The mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1) is based on their collisions with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons could be colliding with the gas, which might affect the effective free path for electrons.

Wait, maybe the electron beam's presence causes the gas to ionize, which could either increase or decrease the mean free path. Alternatively, the presence of electrons introduces more particles (ions, electrons) into the system, effectively increasing the pressure. Because more particles would lead to shorter mean free paths.

So the pressure increases when the beam is on, because the electrons are adding more particles (like secondary electrons or ions) into the system. So the pressure P in the mean free path formula increases, which would make the mean free path λ decrease.

But wait, the pressure in the system is the same because the pumps are still running. Or is the pressure changing because the beam is causing more particles? Hmm, the question states that the vacuum pumps are creating an ultra-high vacuum, and some gas remains. When the beam is on, does that cause the pressure to rise? Maybe because the electrons are causing more gas molecules to be ionized, which could lead to more charged particles. But the overall pressure would probably stay the same if the pumps are still working, but the presence of charged particles could affect how the mean free path is determined for electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence causes gas molecules to be excited or ionized, increasing the number of collisions for the electrons. So, for the electrons, their mean free path would be shorter because they collide more with the gas molecules, which are now more active.

So, for the electrons, λ2 would be shorter than λ1. Because λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules, which was calculated without the electrons. So the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) would be less than λ1.

So looking at the options: Option C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but wait another thought. The mean free path for the gas molecules is λ1. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving and colliding with the gas. So the presence of electrons would increase the number of collisions for the gas molecules. Does that affect the gas's mean free path? Or is λ1 still just for the gas, and λ2 is for the electrons?

Hmm, the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So I think λ2 refers to the mean free path of the electrons, not the gas. So if the electrons are scattering more due to the gas, their mean free path λ2 is shorter.

So, back to the options. The options are about λ2 relative to λ1. So if λ2 < λ1, that's option C.

But wait, let me think about the mean free path formula again. The mean free path for the gas molecules is λ1 = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). When the electron beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure increases due to more interactions. But the actual pressure P in the chamber is still the same, but the presence of the electrons could add more particles (like electrons and ions) into the system. Wait, but in the formula, P is the pressure, which is related to the number of particles. If the electron beam adds more particles (like electrons), then the effective pressure for electrons' movement would be higher, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1) is the same, but the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter because the gas scatters the electrons. So in that case, λ2 is less than λ1.

So the correct answer would be C) λ2 < λ1.

The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In this scenario, Mike calculated the mean free path of gas molecules (λ1) in the ultra-high vacuum chamber based on factors like pressure, temperature, and volume. However, when the electron beam is activated, the mean free path changes to λ2, which is observed to be different from λ1. 

The key factors affecting the mean free path are pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The pressure in the chamber remains the same, as the vacuum pumps maintain the ultra-high vacuum state. However, the presence of the electron beam introduces additional effects. The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, increasing the number of charged particles in the system. This effectively alters the interaction environment, leading to more frequent collisions for the electrons. As a result, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) becomes shorter than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1).

Thus, the observation that λ2 is shorter than λ1 aligns with the fact that the electron beam increases scattering events for the electrons, reducing their mean free path. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
