Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, I think nu here refers to a neutrino, probably a muon neutrino since the muon is a mu(+) in the products. So it's a pion decay. 

The pion is Pi(+), and it's at rest. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but where's the neutrino's mass? I remember that neutrinos are considered massless in many problems, especially in particle physics, so I'll assume the neutrino has zero mass. That simplifies things.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So the magnitude of their momenta should be the same, but opposite in direction.

But wait, for kinetic energy, how do we approach this? I remember that in decay problems, especially when the parent is at rest, we can use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy is just its rest mass energy. The muon and neutrino will share that energy, but their momenta must balance each other.

Let me think about the energy and momentum conservation. The initial energy is the pion's rest energy: E_initial = m_pi * c^2. Since c is squared, but in particle physics, units are often in MeV and masses in MeV/c², so perhaps the c² cancels out. So E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

Similarly, the momentum vectors must add to zero. So the magnitudes of their momenta are equal, p_mu = p_nu, and their directions are opposite.

So, let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (and the neutrino, since their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction).

Now, the energy of each particle is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units might complicate. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and similarly for the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino has mass m_nu ≈ 0, so E_nu ≈ p.

Wait, since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p. So, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and the neutrino's is p.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Because the initial energy is m_pi * c², and in these units, it's m_pi.

So, the equation is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, solving for p:

Let me denote m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c², m_pi =139.6 MeV/c².

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Let me set x = p for simplicity.

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x

Let me compute the squares:

(105.7)^2 = approx 11170 (because 100^2=10,000, 105^2=11,025, so 105.7^2 is about 11170)

(139.6)^2 = let's compute that. 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So, (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 ≈ 19488.16.

So,

11170 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Rearranging,

2 * 139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11170

Compute 19488.16 - 11170 = 8318.16

So,

2 * 139.6 x = 8318.16

Calculate 2*139.6 = 279.2

So,

x = 8318.16 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute this.

Let me see:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8318.16.

So 30 would give 8376, which is 57.84 higher.

So 8318.16 is 8376 - 57.84.

So 30 - (57.84/279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.207 ≈ 29.793.

So x ≈ 29.793 MeV/c ?

Wait, but wait, the units—since we're in MeV and masses are in MeV/c², then momentum p would be in MeV/c. So, p ≈ 29.793 MeV/c.

So, p is about 29.8 MeV/c, and x is this, so p≈29.8.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Compute 8318.16 / 279.2.

Let me divide 8318.16 by 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 8100.8 (because 279.2 * 30=8376, subtract 279.2 to get 29: 8376-279.2=8096.8)

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * (30-1) )= 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8.

But 8096.8 is less than 8318.16.

So how much more?

8318.16 -8096.8= 221.36.

Now, 221.36 / 279.2 = approximately 0.795.

So, 29.795, or about 29.8.

So, p ≈29.8 MeV/c.

So, the muon's momentum is about 29.8 MeV/c, and the neutrino's is the same, but opposite. So, the muon's energy is sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.8)^2 = approx 888.04

(105.7)^2 is 11170.

So sqrt(888.04 + 11170 ) = sqrt(12058.04) ≈ let's see, 109.8^2=12056.04, since 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher. So sqrt(12058) ≈109.8 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.8 MeV.

Wait a minute, but the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino is 109.8 +29.8=139.6, which matches, so that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. For the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu. The neutrino's KE is its energy, because it's massless. So KE_nu = E_nu.

So, KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 =4.1 MeV.

Wait, 109.8 -105.7=4.1?

Wait, 105.7 +4.1=109.8.

Yes, correct.

The neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that matches.

Wait, but let me check the calculations more accurately because approximations can lead to small errors.

Let me recalculate p more accurately.

Equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) +p=139.6

Let me compute this using exact algebra.

Let me denote p as x.

So,

sqrt(x² + 11170) = 139.6 -x

Squaring both sides,

x² + 11170 = (139.6)^2 -2*139.6 x +x²

Simplify:

11170 = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 x

Compute (139.6)^2:

139.6 *139.6

Let me compute this.

139 *139 = 19321.

139 *0.6 =83.4 → 139 *0.6 *2 = 2*83.4=166.8, but wait, it's better to compute 139.6^2:

= (140 -0.4)^2=140^2 -2*140*0.4 +0.4^2=19600 - 112 + 0.16=19600-112=19488; 19488 +0.16=19488.16.

So,

11170 =19488.16 -279.2x

Rearranging,

279.2x =19488.16 -11170 = 8318.16

x=8318.16 /279.2

Compute 8318.16 ÷279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29= 279.2*30=8376 → subtract 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 29 units give 8096.8. The difference is 8318.16 -8096.8 =221.36.

So, 221.36 /279.2 = approximately 0.7949.

So x=29.7949 → approximately 29.795, so 29.8 MeV/c.

So p=29.8.

Thus, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.8^2 = 888.04.

105.7^2=11170.49.

Sum: 888.04 +11170.49=12058.53.

sqrt(12058.53)= approximately 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu=109.8 MeV.

KE_mu=109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

Wait, 105.7 plus 4.1 is 109.8, correct.

The neutrino's energy is p=29.8 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are 4.1 MeV (muon) and 29.8 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's the closest.

So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
$\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu_\mu$  

The pion ($\pi^+$) is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy:  
$E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}$  

After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon ($\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\nu_\mu$). The neutrino is assumed massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum:  
$E_{\nu_\mu} = p_{\nu_\mu}$  

The muon's energy is given by:  
$E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}$  

By conservation of energy:  
$E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu_\mu}$  
$139.6 = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + (105.7)^2} + p_{\mu}$  

Let $p_{\mu} = x$. Substituting:  
$139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x$  

Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
$\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x$  
$x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2$  
$x^2 + 11170.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2$  

Simplifying:  
$11170.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x$  
$279.2x = 19488.16 - 11170.49$  
$279.2x = 8317.67$  
$x = \frac{8317.67}{279.2} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}/c$  

Thus, the muon's momentum is $p_{\mu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}/c$, and the neutrino's momentum is the same.  

The muon's total energy is:  
$E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{888.04 + 11170.49} \approx \sqrt{12058.53} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}$  

The muon's kinetic energy is:  
$KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}$  

The neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy:  
$KE_{\nu_\mu} = p_{\nu_\mu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}$  

Thus, the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately $4.1 \, \text{MeV}$ and $29.8 \, \text{MeV}$, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
