Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in the solution. So, we're dealing with a solution where Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) are present. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the dithiocyanato complex refers to. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ligands. But wait, let me think. I remember that for metal complexes, the stability constant βn is for the complex with n ligands. So, Co(SCN)_1^2+ would be β1, Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be β2, and so on up to β4 for four ligands.

The blue complex is probably the one with a certain number of SCN- ligands. Wait, I think the blue complex is the one with six ligands, but wait no, the question says dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN- per complex. Or wait, dithiocyanato might mean two SCN groups, like maybe it's a neutral complex. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that.

Wait, no, the term dithiocyanato usually refers to two SCN- ligands. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ where n ranges from 1 to 4. So the blue dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ions. Wait, but in the options given, the answer might refer to the third complex, which has β3=63. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the complexes are:

Co(SCN)_1^2+ → β1=9
Co(SCN)_2^2+ → β2=40
Co(SCN)_3^2+ → β3=63
Co(SCN)_4^2+ → β4=16

Wait, but βn is typically the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, for each step, it's the equilibrium for adding another SCN-.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So the blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ligands, but wait wait, I'm a bit confused here. I think in some cases, the color changes with the number of ligands. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the blue complex could be the one with four SCN- ligands, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the blue dithiocyanato is the complex with two SCN- ligands, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

But wait, the question says "dithiocyanato" which implies two thiocyanate groups. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So the problem is to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

But wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Hmm, maybe blue is a specific complex. Wait, I think the hexaaqua complex of Co(II) is pink, and when SCN- is added, the color changes to blue, which is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ complex. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the common cobalt thiocyanato complexes.

I recall that [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is a deep blue color. Wait, no, maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is dark blue. Alternatively, [Co(SCN)_2]Cl2 is a blue solution. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Co(SCN)_3^2− is blue. I'm a bit rusty on the exact colors, but perhaps I should proceed with the given data without getting stuck on the color.

But perhaps the blue complex is the one with three SCN- ligands, [Co(SCN)_3]^2−. Because I remember that the addition of thiocyanate to Co(II) forms a series of complexes, and the color changes from pink (aqueous) to blue as SCN- is added. For example, the first complex [Co(SCN)]^2+ is pink, the second is blue, the third is green, etc. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} as the blue dithiocyanato complex. So, perhaps the answer is the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation without focusing too much on the color, using the given stability constants.

The total cobalt species includes all possible complexes: [Co(H2O)_6]^2+ (if any), [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc., but the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) and SCN-; perhaps the initial [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, but when SCN- is present, the Co^2+ will form complexes with SCN-.

Wait, but the question says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which includes all the species. So, the sum of all [CoX]^2+ species is 1e-2 M.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased: the total cobalt concentration is c(Co)=1e-2 M. So, the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M.

So, the problem is to calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model the formation of all possible complexes. Let me think about how to approach this.

The general approach for such problems is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants. The fraction of each species can be found using the stepwise formation constants.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, i.e., the equilibrium for Co(SCN)_n^2+.

Wait, but wait, βn is the overall formation constant for the complex up to n SCN- ligands. So, the stepwise formation constants would be different. Let me clarify.

Wait, the overall β for the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+/ [Co^2+][SCN^-]

Similarly, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+/ [Co(SCN)]^2+ [SCN^-]

Wait, no, no, wait. No, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is the product of the stepwise formation constants. Let me think.

Wait, generally, the overall formation constant (βn) is the product of the stepwise constants K1, K2, ..., Kn where K1 = [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]), K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co(SCN)]^2+ [SCN^-]), and so on.

So, the overall βn = K1 * K2 * ... * Kn.

But in the problem, we are given the βn values for each complex. So, for each n, βn = [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ / ([Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, no, I think I might have that wrong. The overall βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands from the metal ion and n SCN- ions. So, for Co^2+ and SCN^-:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ ; βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, each βn is given, and the problem is to calculate the fraction of each species.

Wait, but the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, the plan is to compute the fraction of each complex in the solution, given the total cobalt concentration and the SCN- concentration.

But the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So, let's proceed.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co^2+.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the distribution of Co species based on the given β values and the concentrations.

The general approach is to find the fraction of each species f_n as:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + Σ (β_k [SCN^-]^k) for k=0 to 4 )

Wait, wait, but wait. Because the sum includes all possible species from n=0 to n=4. Oh, but when n=0, it's free Co^2+.

So, the total concentration is the sum of all f_n multiplied by their respective concentrations, and the fraction for each f_n is (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over k=0 to 4 β_k [SCN^-]^k + 1?), no. Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the stability constants are given for each complex, so the fraction of each complex is determined by the product of β and the ligand concentration raised to the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such terms.

So, the general formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (Σ (β_k [L]^k) for k=0 to 4 )

But in our case, [L] is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Wait, but wait, when n=0, the species is Co^2+ with no ligands. So, the term for n=0 would be β_0 [L]^0, but β_0 is 1, since [Co^2+] = [Co^2+], so the term is 1 * [L]^0 = 1.

So, the denominator becomes 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

So, for each n, f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / denominator.

So, in our case, [L] = 0.1 M.

So, let me compute each term.

Compute each numerator term:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1
n=1: β1=9 → 9 * (0.1)^1 = 0.9
n=2: β2=40 →40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4
n=3: β3=63 →63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063
n=4: β4=16 →16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Now sum all these up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for each complex:

f0: 1/2.3646 ≈ 0.4225

f1: 0.9/2.3646 ≈ 0.3807

f2: 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.1690

f3: 0.063/2.3646 ≈ 0.0266

f4: 0.0016/2.3646 ≈ 0.000677

Wait, summing these up:

0.4225 + 0.3807 = 0.8032

+0.1690 → 0.9722

+0.0266 → 0.9988

+0.000677 → ~1. So, all fractions add up to 1, which makes sense.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes. So, if dithiocyanato refers to the n=2 complex, then f2 is 0.1690, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options are:

A)42.3% → ~42%

B)25.6% → ~25%

C)38.1% → ~38%

D)16.9% → ~16.9%

So, option D is 16.9%, which matches our calculation. But wait, the question says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- per complex, so f2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the blue complex might be the n=4 or n=3, but according to the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has f2 of 16.9%, which would be option D. So the answer is D.

But wait, wait a second. Another thought: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is when there are two SCN- ligands, but perhaps the problem refers to a neutral complex, like [Co(SCN)_4]^(something). Wait, no, the problem says dithiocyanato, so two SCN- ligands.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is wrong because the approach I took assumes that all the complexes are in solution, and the fractions are based on these constants. So perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

In that case, the percentage would be 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations. Let me recount:

Compute each term:

n=0 → 1 * (0.1)^0 =1 → 1

n=1 →9 *0.1=0.9

n=2 →40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

n=3 →63*(0.1)^3=63e-3=0.063

n=4 →16*(0.1)^4=16e-4=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

f2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1690, which is 16.9%.

So the answer would be D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and the concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate ions.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:
  - \( \beta_1 = 9 \) (for \([ \text{Co(SCN)} ]^{2+}\)),
  - \( \beta_2 = 40 \) (for \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2 ]^{2+}\)),
  - \( \beta_3 = 63 \) (for \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_3 ]^{2+}\)),
  - \( \beta_4 = 16 \) (for \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_4 ]^{2+}\)).

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

where \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) and \( n \) represents the number of thiocyanate ligands.

### Calculations:
1. **Numerator terms**:
   - \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 = 1 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \), so \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).
   - \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 0.1 \), so \( 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \).
   - \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.01 \), so \( 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \).
   - \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 0.001 \), so \( 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \).
   - \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 = 16 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 0.0001 \), so \( 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

2. **Denominator**:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( n = 2 \))**:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1690
   \]

4. **Percentage of the dithiocyanato complex**:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.1690 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
