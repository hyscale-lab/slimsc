Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, right? And the pion is stationary. 

I remember that in such decay problems, energy and momentum conservation are key. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum after the decay should be zero. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Or maybe in this case, the mass of the neutrino is negligible compared to the other particles. 

So the particles involved are the pion (Pi+), the muon (mu+), and the neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is probably considered zero here, or at least negligible. 

First, I think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

But wait, the neutrino also has energy. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Let me denote the energies and momenta of the muon and neutrino. Let’s call the muon's energy E_mu and its momentum p_mu. The neutrino's energy is E_nu and its momentum p_nu. 

From momentum conservation: p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal, |p_mu| = |p_nu|. 

Now, the energy of each particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since c is a constant and we're working in units where c=1 (MeV and MeV/c² simplify things), the equations become:

E_mu² = p_mu² + m_mu²
E_nu² = p_nu² + m_nu²

But wait, m_nu is almost zero, so E_nu ≈ p_nu. 

Also, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV (since the pion is at rest and decays into these two particles).

So putting it all together, I can write:

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6  ...(1)
And from momentum, p_mu = p_nu. Let's call this common magnitude p.

So E_mu² = p² + (105.7)²  ...(2)
E_nu² = p² + 0^2 => E_nu = p  ...(3)

Substituting E_nu = p into equation (1): E_mu + p = 139.6

From equation (2): E_mu² = p² + (105.7)^2

Let me substitute p = 139.6 - E_mu into equation (2):

E_mu² = (139.6 - E_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding (139.6 - E_mu)^2: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 E_mu + E_mu^2

So, E_mu² = (139.6^2 - 2*139.6 E_mu + E_mu²) + 105.7^2

Subtract E_mu² from both sides:

0 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 E_mu + 105.7^2

Let me compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2 = let's see, 140^2 is 19600, minus (0.4)^2=0.16, wait no. Actually, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4². 140² is 19600, 2*140*0.4 is 112, so 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16? Wait, no, more accurately, (140 - 0.4)^2 is 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, wait, perhaps I should just calculate 139.6 * 139.6:

Let me do it step by step. 139.6 * 139.6.

Hmm, 130 * 130 =16900, but that's not helpful. Let me compute 140 * 140 = 19600. Then subtract 0.4 from each, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. So 139.6^2 is 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 (since 105^2 is 11025, and 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms: 2*105*0.7=147, so (105+0.7)^2=105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 +147 +0.49= 11172.49).

So back to the equation:

0 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 E_mu + 11172.49

Adding 19488.16 and 11172.49: 19488.16 + 11172.49 = 30660.65.

So, 0 = 30660.65 - 279.2 E_mu

Wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2. So,

279.2 E_mu = 30,660.65

E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Divide 30660.65 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 100 = 27920. 30660.65 - 27920 = 2740.65.

So 279.2 * 9 = 2512.8 (since 279.2 * 10 is 2792, minus 279.2 gives 2512.8).

So 2740.65 - 2512.8 = 227.85.

So that's 109 so far (100+9). Now 227.85 / 279.2 is approximately 0.816.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Wait, let me double-check with calculator steps.

Alternatively, 30660.65 / 279.2:

Let me compute 279.2 * 109 = ?

279.2 * 100 = 27920
279.2 * 9 = 2512.8
Total: 27920 +2512.8=30432.8.

Subtract this from 30660.65: 30660.65 - 30432.8 = 227.85.

So 227.85 / 279.2 = approx 0.816. So E_mu = 109.816 MeV.

Then E_nu = 139.6 - E_mu = 139.6 - 109.816 = 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the kinetic energy of the product particles. Kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c². Since c=1 in these units, that's E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is 109.816 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So:

KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.

For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, its energy is all kinetic. So KE_nu ≈ E_nu = 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be D.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in this case, the problem might be considering the neutrino as massless, which I did. So the approach is correct.

So the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV. So option D matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and the total energy and momentum are conserved. The rest masses are given as:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2, \quad m_\nu \approx 0 \, \text{(negligible)}.
\]

### Conservation of Energy:
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(E_{\mu^+}\)) and the neutrino (\(E_\nu\)):  
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum:
Since the pion is stationary, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:  
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
\]  
Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \(E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4\), we write:  
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2, \quad E_\nu^2 = p^2 + m_\nu^2.
\]  
Since \(m_\nu \approx 0\), \(E_\nu \approx p\). Substituting \(p = E_\nu\) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu^+}^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2\) and \(p = E_\nu\) into the above:  
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = E_\nu^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]  
Expanding \(E_\nu = 139.6 - E_{\mu^+}\) and substituting:  
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = (139.6 - E_{\mu^+})^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)E_{\mu^+} + E_{\mu^+}^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Canceling \(E_{\mu^+}^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
0 = (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 - 2(139.6)E_{\mu^+}.
\]  
Substituting \((139.6)^2 = 19488.16\) and \((105.7)^2 = 11172.49\):  
\[
0 = 30660.65 - 279.2E_{\mu^+}.
\]  
Solving for \(E_{\mu^+}\):  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \frac{30660.65}{279.2} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_\nu = 139.6 - E_{\mu^+} = 139.6 - 109.816 \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy:
The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.816 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately equal to its energy since its rest mass is negligible:  
\[
KE_\nu \approx E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
