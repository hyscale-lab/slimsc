Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle depends a lot on its velocity, especially when it's moving at speeds close to the speed of light. 

Wait, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But wait, the question says 3 neutrons, so maybe it's Li-6? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons would be 6, so Li-6. Yeah, I think that's right. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So, the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus. 

I remember that the total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy (mc²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Right. So E = gamma * m c².

But wait, what's the rest mass of Li-6? I think the mass number A is 6, so the nucleus is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. So I can calculate the rest mass energy as m c².

So first, calculating gamma. Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784? Let me check: 0.28 * 0.28 is indeed 0.0784. So yes.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units. So m = 6 u. Let me calculate that in kg. 1 u is 1.660539e-27 kg, so 6 u is 6 * 1.660539e-27 = approx 9.963234e-27 kg.

Wait, wait. But wait, the rest mass energy is m c squared. So E_rest = m c². And c is about 3e8 m/s. So E_rest = 9.963234e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculating that: 3e8 squared is 9e16. Multiply by 9.963e-27: 9e16 * 9.963e-27 = Let me see:

9e16 * 1e-27 is 9e-11. But wait, 9e16 * 9.963e-27 is (9 * 9.963) * 1e(16-27) )= approx 89.667 * 1e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J. Hmm, but that's in joules. I need to convert that into GeV because the options are in GeV.

Wait, I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So to convert from joules to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19. 

So E_rest in eV is (8.9667e-10 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = 8.9667e-10 / 1.602e-19 ≈ let's see, 8.9667 / 1.602 is about 5.6, and 1e-10 / 1e-19 is 1e9. So 5.6e9 eV = 5.6 GeV. 

Wait wait, let me redo that calculation more accurately. 8.9667e-10 divided by 1.602e-19 is (8.9667 / 1.602) * 1e9. 8.9667 / 1.602 is approximately 5.6 because 1.602 *5 is 8.01, 5.6*1.602=8.9712. Oh, close. So E_rest is ~5.6 GeV.

Wait, but that's just the rest energy. The total energy is gamma multiplied by that. So E_total = gamma * E_rest.

Gamma was about 3.5714, so 3.5714 * 5.6 GeV ≈ let's compute that.

3 *5.6 is 16.8, 0.5714 *5.6 is approximately 3.1998. Adding them, 16.8 +3.2 = 20.0 GeV. So E_total is approx 20 GeV.

Looking at the options: Option C is 20.132 GeV, D is 21.419, B is 23.069, A is 18.475. So it's close to 20. So the correct answer is likely option C.

Wait, but I approximated gamma as 3.5714. Let me calculate gamma more accurately. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) when v =0.96c. So v²/c² is 0.9216, so 1 - that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part is exact.

Wait but maybe I made a mistake in calculating E_rest? Let me check the exact number.

The exact mass of Li-6: Let's see, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.012 amu. Oh wait, I think I used 6 u, which is 6 *1.00784 (Wait no, wait: 1 u is about 1.00784 atomic mass units, but wait, no, actually, 1 u is precisely defined as 1 atomic mass unit. Wait, no, wait: the atomic mass unit (u) is defined as 1/12 of the mass of carbon-12. So 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. So for Li-6, the mass is 6.012 u. Oh, wait, I think I used 6 u instead of the precise 6.012 u. So I should correct that.

Wait, let me get the exact mass of Li-6. I'm a bit unsure from memory. Let me think: Carbon-12 has a mass of 12 u, exactly 12 times the u. For lithium-6, the isotope, the mass is approximately 6.012 atomic mass units. So m =6.012 u.

So m =6.012 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 6 *1.660539e-27 is 9.963234e-27, plus 0.012*1.660539e-27 = 0.019926468e-27, so total is approximately 9.98316e-27 kg.

Wait, wait: 6.012 *1.660539e-27 = let me compute 6 *1.660539 = 9.963234; 0.012 * 1.660539 = 0.019926468. Summing: 9.963234 +0.019926468=9.983160468e-27 kg.

So E_rest = m c² = (9.983160468e-27 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculating that: (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So E_rest = 9.983160468e-27 * 9e16 = (9.983160468 *9) *1e(-27 +16) )= 89.84844421e-11 J. So 8.9848444e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV =1.602e-19 J. So E_rest (eV) = 8.9848444e-10 /1.602e-19.

Let's compute that: 8.9848444e-10 / 1.602e-19 = (8.9848444 /1.602) * 1e9.

8.9848444 /1.602 is approximately 5.607. Let me compute 1.602 *5.607= 8.984. Close enough. So E_rest ≈5.607 GeV.

So the total energy E = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 *5.607 GeV.

Calculating that: 3 *5.607 is 16.821, 0.57142857 *5.607 ≈ 3.203 (since 0.5 *5.607=2.8035, 0.07142857 *5.607≈0.400). So total is 16.821 +3.203=20.024 GeV.

Hmm, but the options have more precise numbers. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.607.

Let me compute it step by step. 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285. 3.57142857 *0.607.

Wait, 3.57142857 *0.6 is 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.007 is 0.02499999999.

So 0.607 is 0.6 +0.007. So 3.57142857 *0.607 =2.142857142 +0.02499999999 =2.167857142.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.167857142 =20.025 GeV.

But the options have C as 20.132 GeV and D as 21.419. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: instead of calculating in kg and joules, perhaps I can use the formula in terms of atomic mass units and GeV directly.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Oh right, because E=mc², so 1 u corresponds to 931.5 MeV. So 1 u = 931.5 MeV = 0.9315 GeV.

So, for Li-6, the mass is 6.012 u. So E_rest =6.012 * 0.9315 GeV ≈ let's compute that.

6 *0.9315=5.589 GeV. 0.012 *0.9315=0.011178 GeV. Summing gives 5.589 +0.011178=5.600178 GeV.

That's about 5.6002 GeV. 

Then, E_total = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600178 GeV.

Calculating that: 3 *5.600178 is 16.800534 GeV. 0.57142857 *5.600178.

0.5 *5.600178=2.800089 GeV.

0.07142857 *5.600178 ≈0.400000 GeV. So 0.57142857 *5.600178 is approximately 3.200089 GeV.

Adding 16.800534 +3.200089=20.000623 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0006 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV. So why the difference? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) where v=0.96c.

So v²/c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest energy calculation is more precise. Let me compute 6.012 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.012 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV. 0.012 *931.5=11.178 MeV. So total is 5589 +11.178=5600.178 MeV =5.600178 GeV.

So that's correct.

So now, 3.57142857 *5.600178 GeV.

Let me calculate 3.57142857 *5.600178.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600178. Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000178. Let me compute that:

0.000178 *3.57142857 = approx 0.000636 GeV.

So adding those together: 2.142857142 +0.000636 =2.143493 GeV.

So total E_total is 17.85714285 +2.143493 =20.000636 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0006 GeV. So why is option C 20.132? Maybe I made a mistake in the mass?

Wait, maybe I used the wrong isotope. The question says Li with three neutrons. Let me double-check the isotope.

Li has atomic number 3. So 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then mass number A=3+3=6. So it's Li-6. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is a bit more precise. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01219275 u. Let me take that as accurate.

So m =6.01219275 u.

E_rest =m *931.5 MeV/u =6.01219275 *931.5 = let me compute.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01219275 *931.5= ?

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.00219275 *931.5 ≈0.00219275 *931.5 = approx 2.03 MeV.

So total for 0.01219275 is 9.315 +2.03=11.345 MeV.

So E_rest =5589 +11.345 =5600.345 MeV =5.600345 GeV.

So E_rest is 5.600345 GeV.

Now, calculating E_total =gamma * E_rest.

3.57142857 *5.600345.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600345.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000345=0.001234.

So total for 0.600345 is 2.142857142 +0.001234≈2.144091 GeV.

Adding to 17.85714285, we get 20.001234 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0012 GeV. So why is option C 20.132?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

Wait, but perhaps the exact gamma is a bit different? Let me compute 1/0.28 precisely.

0.28 is 7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.571428571428571...

So no mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.96c, but there might be a relativistic factor I'm missing. Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy? No, the question says the energy of the collider, which is usually the total energy.

Wait, the options are all around 20 GeV, except option C is 20.132 and option D is 21.419. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 1 u in GeV/c². Because 1 u=931.494064 MeV/c². So 1 u=0.931494064 GeV/c².

So E_rest =6.01219275 u *0.931494064 GeV/u.

Let me compute that:

6.01219275 *0.931494064.

Breaking it down:

6 *0.931494064 =5.588964384 GeV.

0.01219275 *0.931494064.

0.01 *0.931494064=0.00931494064 GeV.

0.00219275 *0.931494064 ≈0.00219275 *0.931494 ≈0.002042 GeV.

So total for 0.01219275 is 0.00931494064 +0.002042≈0.011357 GeV.

So E_rest=5.588964384 +0.011357=5.600321 GeV.

Now, E_total=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600321.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.600321.

(3.57142857 *5) =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600321.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000321 ≈0.001145.

So total for 0.600321 is 2.142857142 +0.001145 =2.143999 GeV.

Adding to 17.85714285, E_total=17.85714285 +2.143999=20.0011418 GeV.

Still around 20.001 GeV. So why is option C 20.132?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the energy is given per nucleon, or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". RHIC accelerates heavy ions, which are nuclei. So each nucleus has a certain energy, and the total energy per nucleus is gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy? Let's see. Kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c². Let me compute that.

E_kinetic = (gamma-1) * E_rest.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_kinetic=2.57142857 *5.600321 GeV.

2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.600321 ≈1.543333.

Adding together: 12.85714285 +1.543333=14.400475 GeV.

But the options are about 20 GeV, not 14. So option C is 20.132, which is close to what I initially got, but I'm getting around 20.001 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing E_rest. Let me compute 6.01219275 *931.494064 MeV with more precision.

6.01219275 *931.494064 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.01219275 *931.494064 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.494064 =9.31494064 MeV.

0.00219275 *931.494064 ≈ 0.00219275 *931.494064.

Compute 0.002 *931.494064 =1.862988128 MeV.

0.00019275 *931.494064 ≈0.00019275 *931.494064 ≈0.1798 MeV.

So 0.00219275 *931.494064 ≈1.862988128 +0.1798=2.042788128 MeV.

So total for 0.01219275 is 9.31494064 +2.042788128=11.35772877 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964384 +11.35772877=5600.322113 MeV=5.600322113 GeV.

So E_rest=5.600322113 GeV.

Now, E_total=3.57142857 *5.600322113.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.600322113.

= (3 + 0.57142857) *5.600322113

= 3*5.600322113 + 0.57142857*5.600322113.

3*5.600322113 =16.80096634 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.600322113.

= (4/7) *5.600322113.

Wait, 4/7 is approx 0.57142857.

So 4/7 *5.600322113.

5.600322113 ÷7 = approx 0.800045996.

Multiply by 4: 3.200183984 GeV.

So total E_total=16.80096634 +3.200183984=20.00115032 GeV.

So about 20.0012 GeV.

Hmm, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So why the discrepancy? Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma is more precise. Let me compute gamma with more decimal places.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

But wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations? Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma=3.571428571428571...

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should take into account the exact rest mass, including any binding energy or other factors? Wait, no, in particle physics, the rest mass energy is just based on the atomic mass, which already accounts for binding energy.

Wait, maybe the question is about the kinetic energy. Let me check. If the energy is kinetic, E_kinetic = gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma-1) m c².

So using gamma=3.57142857, gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_kinetic =2.57142857 *5.600322113 GeV.

Compute that: 2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.600322113=Approx 2.57142857 *0.6=1.542857142, and 2.57142857 *0.000322113≈0.000827. So total is about 1.543684.

So E_kinetic=12.85714285 +1.543684≈14.4008 GeV.

But the options are about 20 GeV, so it's not matching. So the problem must be about total energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass of Li-6? Let me double-check the exact mass.

Looking up, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01219275 u. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not 0.96c, but I used the correct value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise terms. Let me compute it using the exact value.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1 / sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Exactly 3 and 4/28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the mass is in atomic mass units, but I should use the actual nuclear mass, which is slightly different from the atomic mass? Because the atomic mass includes electrons. Oh wait, in heavy ion colliders, they are usually referring to the bare nuclei, so they have no electrons. So the mass considered is the nuclear mass, not the atomic mass.

Ah! That's probably it. So I used the atomic mass including electrons, which is incorrect.

So I need to correct the rest mass energy by subtracting the mass of the electrons.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and in the nucleus, it's Li^6 with 3 electrons if it's neutral. So the atomic mass is the sum of the nucleus plus electrons. But when considering the nucleus alone, we need to subtract the mass of the electrons.

So for Li-6, the atomic mass is 6.01219275 u, which includes 6 protons (but wait, no, Li has 3 protons. Wait, no, the atomic mass is per atom, which includes 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons.

Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so each neutral atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the Li-6 atom is 6.01219275 u. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01219275 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u each. So three electrons would be 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So the nuclear mass is 6.01219275 -0.00164574=6.01054701 u.

So E_rest =6.01054701 * 931.494064 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

6.01054701 *931.494064 MeV.

6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01054701 *931.494064=approx 9.836 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964384 +9.836 =5600.800384 MeV =5.600800384 GeV.

Now, E_total=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600800384.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285 GeV.

3.57142857 *0.600800384.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000800384≈0.002859.

So total for 0.600800384 is 2.142857142 +0.002859≈2.145716 GeV.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.002858 GeV.

Still around 20.003 GeV, which is close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for the mass of the nucleus. Let me compute it accurately.

Nuclear mass of Li-6:6.01219275 u -3 *0.00054858 u.

So 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

6.01219275 -0.00164574=6.01054701 u.

E_rest =6.01054701 *931.494064 MeV.

Let me compute 6.01054701 * 931.494064.

= (6 +0.01054701) *931.494064.

=6 *931.494064 +0.01054701 *931.494064.

=5588.964384 + 9.836020 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964384 +9.836020=5598.800404 MeV? Wait, wait, no, 5588.964384 +9.83602=5598.800404 MeV? Wait, no, 5588.964384 +9.83602 equals 5598.800404 MeV? Wait, that can't be right because 6.01054701 u is about 6 u, so 6 u *931 MeV/u is 5586 MeV. Wait, but 6.01054701 u is 6.0105 u, so 6.0105 *931.494064 MeV.

Let me compute 6.0105 *931.494064.

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384.

0.0105 *931.494064=9.830687672.

So total E_rest=5588.964384 +9.830687672=5598.7950716 MeV.

Which is 5.5987950716 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.5988 GeV. Wait, but earlier I thought it would be ~5.6 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me do it step by step.

Wait, 6.01054701 u * 931.494064 MeV/u.

Breaking it down:

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.01054701 *931.494064 =9.836020 MeV.

So total E_rest=5588.964384 +9.836020=5598.800404 MeV=5.598800404 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.5988 GeV.

So E_rest=5.5988 GeV.

Then, E_total=gamma * E_rest.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.5988.

Compute 3 *5.5988=16.7964.

0.57142857 *5.5988 ≈3.2074.

So E_total=16.7964 +3.2074=20.0038 GeV.

Still about 20.0038 GeV.

So the result is approximately 20.0038 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.13 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the nuclear mass. Let me compute it again.

Nuclear mass = atomic mass - mass of electrons.

Atomic mass of Li-6:6.01219275 u.

Mass of 3 electrons:3 *0.00054858 u=0.00164574 u.

So nuclear mass=6.01219275 -0.00164574=6.01054701 u.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this using more precise values for 1 u in GeV/c².

As 1 u =931.494064 MeV/c²=0.931494064 GeV/c².

So E_rest =6.01054701 u *0.931494064 GeV/u.

Calculating:

6 *0.931494064=5.588964384 GeV.

0.01054701 *0.931494064=0.009836 GeV.

So E_rest=5.588964384 +0.009836=5.608799998 GeV≈5.6088 GeV.

Ah! Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:

E_rest=6.01054701 *0.931494064.

6 *0.931494064=5.588964384.

0.01054701 *0.931494064= let's compute it precisely.

0.01054701 *0.931494064:

Compute 0.01 *0.931494064=0.00931494064.

0.00054701 *0.931494064= approx 0.00054701 *0.931494=0.0005111.

So total is 0.00931494064 +0.0005111=0.00982604064 GeV.

So E_rest=5.588964384 +0.00982604064=5.608790424 GeV.

Ah, so E_rest is approximately 5.6088 GeV, not 5.6 GeV. That makes a difference.

Now, E_total= gamma * E_rest.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6088.

Let me compute this.

3 *5.6088=16.8264.

0.57142857 *5.6088.

Calculate 0.5 *5.6088=2.8044.

0.07142857 *5.6088= approx 0.4017.

So total for 0.57142857 is 2.8044 +0.4017=3.2061.

Adding to 16.8264:16.8264 +3.2061=20.0325 GeV.

So approximately 20.0325 GeV.

That's about 20.033 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_rest more accurately.

Let me compute 6.01054701 *0.931494064.

6.01054701 *0.931494064.

Let me compute 6 *0.931494064=5.588964384.

0.01054701 *0.931494064.

Compute 0.01 *0.931494064=0.00931494064.

0.00054701 *0.931494064=0.00054701 *0.931494064.

Let me compute this precisely:

0.00054701 *0.931494064.

=0.00054701 *0.931494064.

=0.00054701 * (0.9 +0.031494064)

=0.00054701 *0.9=0.000492309.

0.00054701 *0.031494064=approx 0.00001726.

So total=0.000492309 +0.00001726=0.000509569.

So 0.01054701 *0.931494064=0.00931494064 +0.000509569=0.00982450964 GeV.

So E_rest=5.588964384 +0.00982450964=5.5987888936 GeV.

Wait, that brings E_rest back to about 5.5988 GeV. But earlier calculation using 6.01054701 u gave 5.6088 GeV, which seems conflicting.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me redo the calculation of E_rest.

E_rest = nuclear mass (6.01054701 u) * 931.494064 MeV/u.

6.01054701 *931.494064=?

6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01054701 *931.494064=9.836020 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964384 +9.836020=5598.800404 MeV=5.598800404 GeV.

Ah, so E_rest is 5.5988 GeV.

Now, E_total=3.57142857 *5.5988.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.5988.

3 *5.5988=16.7964.

0.57142857 *5.5988.

Approximately, 0.5 *5.5988=2.7994.

0.07142857 *5.5988≈0.4004.

So 0.57142857 *5.5988≈2.7994 +0.4004=3.1998.

Adding to 16.7964: 16.7964 +3.1998=20.00 GeV.

So approximately 20.00 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation must be done with more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma using more precise terms.

Gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

So no mistake there.

Hmm, perhaps because I'm using an approximate value for the speed of light or other constants, but the problem states that the precision should be 1e-4, so perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach to compute the energy.

Wait, another formula: E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is also equal to (1 - (v²/c²))^-0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact expression for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma to more decimal places.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

No, that's exact.

Hmm. I'm getting about 20.00 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 6.01219275 u for the atomic mass, including the electrons, but without subtracting them. Because when the collider accelerates ions, it's the entire ion, including electrons, that's moving. Wait, no, because in a nucleus, the electrons are separate. Wait, no, the nucleus is bare, so the electrons aren't part of the nucleus.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the entire atom, including electrons, as the mass. But that would mean the rest mass is 6.01219275 u *931.494064 MeV/u, which is 5.600322 GeV, as computed earlier.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857, so E_total=3.57142857 *5.600322=20.0012 GeV.

Wait, so the correct answer is approximately 20.001 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for 1 u.

1 u =931.494064 MeV/c².

So E_rest =6.01219275 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

=6.01219275 *931.494064 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01219275 *931.494064 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064 MeV.

0.00219275 *931.494064=approx 2.03 MeV.

So total E_rest=5588.964384 +9.31494064 +2.03=5600.3093246 MeV=5.600309325 GeV.

E_total=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600309325.

3 *5.600309325=16.800927975.

0.57142857 *5.600309325.

Compute 0.5 *5.600309325=2.8001546625.

0.07142857 *5.600309325≈0.400000 GeV.

So 0.57142857 *5.600309325≈3.2001546625.

Adding to 16.800927975: 16.800927975 +3.2001546625=20.0010826375 GeV.

So approximately 20.0011 GeV.

So the answer should be around 20.001 GeV. But none of the options are exactly that. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, perhaps the correct calculation is done with more precise values, leading to 20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the exact formula for gamma.

Gamma = (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2).

v=0.96c.

So v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

So gamma=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact multiplication.

3.571428571428571 *5.600309325.

Let me compute this accurately:

3.571428571428571 *5.600309325.

= (3 + 0.571428571428571) *5.600309325.

=3 *5.600309325 +0.571428571428571 *5.600309325.

3 *5.600309325 =16.800927975.

0.571428571428571 *5.600309325.

Compute 0.5 *5.600309325=2.8001546625.

0.071428571428571 *5.600309325.

0.07 *5.600309325=0.39202165275.

0.001428571428571 *5.600309325≈0.007999999999.

So 0.071428571428571 *5.600309325≈0.39202165275 +0.007999999999≈0.40002165275.

So 0.571428571428571 *5.600309325≈2.8001546625 +0.40002165275=3.20017631525.

Adding to 16.800927975:16.800927975 +3.20017631525=20.00110429 GeV.

So 20.0011 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, which is the closest higher option, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rest mass may include binding energy or that the actual rest mass is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.96c, but that's given in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula with a different approach, such as considering the kinetic energy as a significant part.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy should be calculated using the exact formula E = gamma m c², where gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

But I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is given differently. Wait, Li-6 has a mass of 6.012 u, but perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me check.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01219275 u. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy using the exact constants without any approximations.

Let me compute E_rest precisely.

E_rest =6.01219275 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

=6.01219275 *931.494064 MeV.

Let me compute 6.01219275 *931.494064.

Compute 6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01219275 *931.494064=9.31494064 + (0.00019275 *931.494064).

Wait, 0.01219275=0.01 +0.00219275.

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064 MeV.

0.00219275 *931.494064= ?

Compute 0.002 *931.494064=1.862988128 MeV.

0.00019275 *931.494064=approx 0.1798 MeV.

So 0.00219275 *931.494064=1.862988128 +0.1798=2.042788128 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964384 +9.31494064 +2.042788128=5588.964384+11.35772877=5600.32211277 MeV=5.600322113 GeV.

Now, E_total=3.57142857 *5.600322113.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.600322113.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 *5.600322113 = ?

Multiply 3.57142857 *5.600322113.

= (3 +0.57142857) *5.600322113.

=3 *5.600322113 +0.57142857 *5.600322113.

3 *5.600322113=16.800966339 GeV.

Now, 0.57142857 *5.600322113.

0.5 *5.600322113=2.8001610565.

0.07142857 *5.600322113= approx 0.4000000 GeV.

So 0.57142857 *5.600322113≈2.8001610565 +0.400000≈3.2001610565 GeV.

Adding to 16.800966339 gives 16.800966339 +3.2001610565=20.001127395 GeV.

So approximately 20.0011 GeV.

Again, the same result. So the correct answer should be approximately 20.001 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the mass. Let me think again: the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass is 6.01219275 u. But wait, that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. To get the nuclear mass, I should subtract the electrons. So nuclear mass is 6.01219275 u - 3 *0.00054858 u=6.01054701 u.

So E_rest=6.01054701 u *931.494064 MeV/u=5.59878889 GeV.

Then, E_total=3.57142857 *5.59878889≈20.032 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.032 GeV, which is closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of 3.57142857 *5.59878889.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.59878889.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.59878889.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.5=1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.09878889≈0.353333333.

So 0.59878889 part is approximately 1.785714285 +0.353333333≈2.139047618.

So total E_total=17.85714285 +2.139047618=20. GeV.

Wait, that's 20.00 GeV.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. The calculation keeps leading me to about 20.00 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but I don't see why it's higher.

Wait, perhaps the velocity is not exactly 0.96c, but perhaps a slightly different value that leads to a higher energy.

Wait, let's think about this differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, no, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is usually the total energy. But sometimes, people refer to kinetic energy. Let me compute both.

Total energy E = gamma m c².

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

If E is total energy, then K = E - m c².

If the options are giving the total energy, then the correct answer is around 20.00 GeV. But if they are giving the kinetic energy, then K ≈20 GeV -5.6 GeV=14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any options.

So I think the question is about the total energy, so the answer should be approximately 20 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV. But my calculation is leading me to 20.00 GeV. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise decimals.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for 1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, is sqrt(0.0784) exactly 0.28?

Yes, because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784. So no error.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is around 20 GeV and the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate all the steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass used is the molar mass instead of the nuclear mass. No, that can't be. Molar mass would be grams per mole, which is a different concept.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use the exact formula with precise decimal handling.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.571428571428571.

So E_total=gamma * m c².

Now, m c²=6.01219275 u *931.494064 MeV/u=5.60032211 GeV.

So E_total=3.57142857 *5.60032211.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 *5.60032211.

Multiply 3.57142857 *5.60032211.

=3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60032211=?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00032211≈0.00114999.

So total for 0.60032211 is 2.142857142 +0.00114999≈2.14400713.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.14400713=20.00115 GeV.

So approximately 20.00115 GeV.

Hmm, so none of the options match except for option C being close but higher.

Wait, perhaps the actual value is 20.132 GeV, and my calculation is off due to more precise mass values or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the energy is given per nucleon. Wait, no, the question refers to the nucleus as a whole.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this and the most accurate calculation I can do gives around 20.00 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01219275 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.01219275 \, \text{u} \times 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5.6003 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is given by \( E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} \). Substituting the values:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6003 \approx 20.001 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.001 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest option to the calculated value is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight differences in constants or approximations.
