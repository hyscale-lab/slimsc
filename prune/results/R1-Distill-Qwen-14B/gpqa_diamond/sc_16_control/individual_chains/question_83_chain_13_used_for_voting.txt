Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the initial solution is being diluted by half because we're adding the same volume of water. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Oh wait, wait, no. Because when you mix two volumes, the total volume is V1 + V2. So initial moles of acetic acid are M1 * V1. Then after adding V2 of water, the new concentration is (M1*V1) / (V1 + V2).

Plugging in the numbers: M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 20 cm³. So moles of acetic acid = 0.05 * 20 = 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 40 = 0.025 M? Oh wait, wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 liters is 0.025 M? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Yes, and the total volume is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about pH at 25% titration and equivalence point.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Wait, no, wait. Titration percentage refers to the amount of base added relative to the equivalence point. So first, I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The original solution after dilution has 0.001 moles of acetic acid, right? Because initial moles were 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001, and diluting doesn't change moles. So for equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the way to equivalence point. That would be 25% of 10 cm³, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, how much is that in moles? Moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 mol, 0.00025 mol of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate, and leaving 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol of acetic acid.

So the total volume at 25% titration is initial solution volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ total. Or 0.0425 L.

So for the 25% titration point, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.74 (since log(1.85e-5) is approx 4.74, because 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is about 0.26 between 1e-5 and 2e-5, which is 4.74).

So, [A-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 L, and [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 L.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So pH = 4.74 + log(1/3) = 4.74 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.263. So around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; option D says 4.57. Hmm, so the first part is 4.26. So the first value is A or D. Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, another approach: the initial moles after dilution are 0.001 mol in 0.04 L, so 0.025 M. When 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added, the moles NaOH are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So it reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol acetate.

So in the solution, the moles of HA are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol, and moles of A- are 0.00025 mol. The total volume is 20 +20 +2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = pKa + log(1/3) ≈4.74 -0.477=4.263. So about 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So the moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (from dilution) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. It will hydrolyze in water:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

The Kb for A- is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25 C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

The concentration of A- is 0.02 M. Using Kb, we can find the pH.

The hydrolysis reaction: Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]. Since Kb is very small, we can approximate that [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C), assuming that x is much smaller than initial concentration.

So Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root of that is approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-]≈1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98. So pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have pH around 9. Let me check the options. Option A's equivalence is 8.52, D's is 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Let me think again. At equivalence point, we have a solution of sodium acetate. The acetate ion is a weak base, which will react with water to produce a basic solution.

So, the initial calculation gave pH around 9, but none of the options match. Hmm... maybe I made an error in the Kb calculation. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

The concentration of A- is 0.02 M. So Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]

Assuming x is the [OH-], then Kb = x²/(0.02 -x). Since Kb is so small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² = 0.02 * Kb = 0.02 *5.405e-10=1.081e-11. x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH=9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of acetate is not 0.02 M. Let me recalculate the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has reacted with NaOH (0.001 mol) to form sodium acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So yes, that part was correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the activity coefficients or something else? No, I think for such a problem, we use the simplified approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should calculate pOH correctly. Let me compute x again.

x = [OH-] = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5. So pOH= log(1/(1.04e-5)) → Wait, no, pOH is -log([OH-]).

So [OH-] =1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5). Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 ≈ -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, pH=14-4.983=9.017. So approximately 9.02.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made an error in the initial setup.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. Oh wait! Wait, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the diluted volume is 40 cm³, correct. Then when titrating, we add 10 cm³ to reach equivalence.

Wait, but wait, when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 M, the moles are 0.1 *0.01 =0.001 mol, which matches the moles of acetic acid. So yes, correct.

Hmm, but in the options, the equivalence point pHs are 8.52,6.73,7,6.92. None around 9. So maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all the acetic acid is converted. Wait, no, equivalence point is when all HA is neutralized to A-.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have considered the sodium hydroxide's concentration correctly. Or perhaps the problem is considering the dilution differently. Wait, no, the initial steps seem correct.

Wait, maybe the pKa used was incorrect. Let me check the pKa. Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa= log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa= -log(1.85e-5)=4.74 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is between 1 and 2, so log(2)=0.3, adding to 4.74). So that's correct.

Hmm, but maybe the problem is that the solution at equivalence point isn't just sodium acetate. Wait, no, it's a solution of sodium acetate in water. Maybe I should compute it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the buffer equation approach isn't fitting because maybe the solution isn't just acetate. Let me think again. Wait, when you have a solution of sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and A-. Na+ is a spectator ion, so the solution's pH depends on A-.

So the correct approach is as I did before. So why is none of the options matching? Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → the equivalence point here is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the Kb calculation.

Wait, maybe I confused pKa and pKb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is 4.74. Then pKb is 14-4.74=9.26. So Kb is 10^(-9.26) ≈ 5.49e-10. Oh wait, that's what I did. So no error there.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the math. Let me calculate 1e-14 /1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈0.5405 *1e-9=5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the problem is when I added the volumes. Wait, initial solution is 40 cm³. Adding 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³. So 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol /0.05 L is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula instead of the approximation. Let me try that.

At equivalence, [A-] =0.02 M. The Kb expression is Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]. Let’s let x be [OH-] = [HA].

So Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x). Since Kb is so small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=~1.04e-5 M. So [OH-]=1.04e-5; pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Still, no option matches. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me reread the question.

Wait, the question says "25% titration", meaning 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ is added. So 25% is 2.5 cm³ as I did earlier.

Wait, another approach: Maybe at equivalence point, the solution isn't just sodium acetate. Wait, no, the sodium comes from NaOH, and the acetate comes from acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles of acetic acid are different. Let me double-check.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 mol. Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001/0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Equivalence point requires 0.001 mol of NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume needed is 10 cm³. Correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck because none of the options match the calculated equivalence pH of ~9.02.

Wait, looking at the options, the equivalence pHs are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B),7 (C),6.92 (D). So none are near 9. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me think again. Is the solution at equivalence point sodium acetate? Or is it something else?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is that the NaOH is being added to the diluted acetic acid, but perhaps the initial dilution affects the calculation. Wait, no, I accounted for that correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the use of the half-equivalence point pH. But no, the question is about 25% and equivalence point.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of NaOH added at 25%, but I think that was correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution at 25% titration is a buffer, but the solution after equivalence is not, but that doesn't change anything.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the ICE table for the equivalence point.

At equivalence, solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. So:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-
Initial: 0.02 M, 0,0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So, Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) ≈ x²/0.02 =5.405e-10 → x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 → [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, same result. So why are the options not matching? Maybe the problem expects the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at equivalence point, which isn't applicable because all the acid is neutralized. So that can't be.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem used the concentration of the acetate without considering the dilution. Wait, no, because when adding NaOH, the volume increases.

Wait, maybe I should think of the problem differently. Did I mix cm³ and liters correctly? Let me check.

At equivalence point, the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ =0.05 L.

Acetate concentration = 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution isn't just sodium acetate, but maybe the solution's pH is calculated with the formula for a salt of a weak acid.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution. Which is what I did. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the pOH. Let me compute pOH again.

[OH-] =1.04e-5 → pOH= -log(1.04e-5)= approximately 4.98, which is correct. So pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me revisit the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should check the possibility that the solution at equivalence point is not a buffer but involves a strong base. No, because NaOH is a strong base, but it's completely neutralized the weak acid, forming a solution of its conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial acetic acid was 0.05 M in 20 cm³, then diluted. So the diluted concentration is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial problem statement is about 25% titration, but I should think about it as 25% of the initial acetic acid's concentration, not 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is option A (4.26;8.52), but I'm not seeing why the equivalence pH would be 8.52. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the 25% titration is based on the initial concentration, not the diluted one. Let me think.

Wait, initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 cm³, making it 0.025 M.

Titrating 25% of the diluted solution's equivalence point would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (as before). So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the pH at 25% of the titration, but not considering the dilution? No, that's not correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at 25% titration, but that's what I did.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the options.

Looking at the options:

A: 4.26;8.52 → 25% is 4.26, equiv is 8.52.

B:3.17;6.73 → not matching.

C:4.73;7 → first is close to pKa, but that would be at half-equivalence.

D:4.57;6.92 → 25% is around 4.57.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles NaOH = 0.1 *0.0025=0.00025 mol. Moles acetic acid initially after dilution is 0.001 mol.

So, after reaction: moles HA =0.001 -0.00025=0.00075. Moles A- =0.00025.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425= 0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log (A-/HA) → 4.74 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.74 + log(1/3)=4.74-0.477=4.263.

So 4.26 is correct. So first part is correct.

So options A and D have first pH as 4.26 and 4.57, respectively. So if the equivalence point is 8.52, which option A says, perhaps I made a mistake in my equivalence calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires considering the dilution in a different way, or perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the equivalence point, but that's not applicable because at equivalence, all HA is converted to A-. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the solution at equivalence point as a buffer, but that's not correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at equivalence point is using the concentration of Na+ which comes from NaOH, but Na+ is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is sodium acetate and water, but maybe the activity is considered. But without data, it's impossible to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the equivalence point calculation. Let me try using exact calculation without approximation.

At equivalence point, [A-] =0.02 M.

The Kb =5.405e-10.

Setting up the equation: x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x²=0.02 *5.405e-10 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5, pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact formula, without the approximation.

So x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → same result.

But perhaps let's compute without assuming x is negligible.

x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11=0.

Solving quadratic: x= [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11) = approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 = ~4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=~6.576e-6.

x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/2 → take positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 → [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514. Oh wait, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier assumption. I thought x was [OH-], but if I set up the equation correctly, maybe I should recalculate.

Wait, wait wait, no. Let me redo the exact calculation.

The equation is x² = Kb * (C -x) =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11) ) ] / 2

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (2.92e-19).

4*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) ≈6.576e-6.

Divide by 2: x≈3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH= -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517.

So approximately 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52, matching option A.

Wait, so earlier I thought the pH was 9.02, but that was when I assumed the [OH-] was about 1e-5, but the exact calculation gives [OH-]=3.288e-6, pH=8.52. So I must have made a mistake in the previous calculation. Oh wait, no, why is this different?

Wait, no, earlier I used the approximation x<<C, so x² = Kb * C. But in reality, when I used the exact approach, x is about 3.288e-6, which is significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should still hold. Hmm, but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Wait, no, the exact solution gives x=3.288e-6, but the approximation gave x=1.04e-5. That's a significant difference. So which one is correct?

Wait, let's compute using the exact approach. Maybe my earlier assumption that x is negligible is not valid.

Wait, 3.288e-6 is 0.0003288% of 0.02. Hmm, but wait, 3.288e-6 is 0.0003288 mM, which is 0.0003% of 0.02 M. So negligible. So why is the exact solution giving a different value?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recompute the exact solution.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a).

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) ≈6.576e-6 → divide by 2 → 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

So why did the approximation give a different result?

Wait, because when I used the approximation, I set x² = Kb * C → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

But according to exact solution, x=3.288e-6, which is about a third of the approximation. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because in reality, x is about 3.288e-6. So the correct [OH-] is 3.288e-6, which gives pH=8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the approximation gives pH=9.02, but in reality, the correct value is 8.52. So I must have made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, why was the initial approximation giving a higher pH? Because I perhaps considered a different Kb value or missed a decimal point.

I think the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, so the first part is 4.26, second is 8.52, which matches option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point volume is calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH required} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence point volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at 25% titration} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.74 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.74 + \log(1/3) = 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of sodium acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{A}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{HA} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-]},
\]
\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.
