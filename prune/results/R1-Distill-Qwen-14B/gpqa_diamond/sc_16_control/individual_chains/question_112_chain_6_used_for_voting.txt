Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We're asked to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A, because the problem mentions measuring in those eigenstates. Once I have those, I can compute the probabilities by projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

Wait, but wait. The operator A's matrix is given. Let me write it out. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because the state is in a two-dimensional space, since it's spin), the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, corresponding to |up> and |down> perhaps.

So, the matrix A has elements Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So A would look like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, because when i=1 and j=2, which is i≠j, so A12 = hbar/2. Similarly, A21 = hbar/2. And A11 and A22 are zero.

Wait, no, wait. The matrix elements are A_ij, so for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are A_11 and A_22, and the off-diagonal are A_12 and A_21. So as per the problem statement, A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j, so yes, the matrix is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

So what's the operator A? It looks like a scaled version of the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

So, the eigenstates of A will be the same as those of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)(-1) = -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, but it's proportional, so I think I need to normalize it first. So first step: find the normalized state |alpha>.

Let me compute the norm of the given state. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 -i) for |down>. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
Compute |2 -i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.
So total norm squared is 2 + 5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the probability of measuring the operator A in each eigenstate is the square of the amplitude of the projection onto each eigenstate.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2)

So, we need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and with |-x>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, < +x | alpha > is the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> 
+ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ) ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and <up|down> is 0, as they are orthonormal.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) ) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify the numerator: (1 + i + 2 -i) = 3.

So, < +x | alpha > = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability of measuring +x is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

So |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, let me compute 9/14: 0.642857, which is approximately 0.643.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2).

So,

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ]

Compute numerator: (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i).

So,

= (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value.

Compute | (-1 + 2i)|² = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5.

So |amplitude|² = 5/(2*7) )=5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but this sum of probabilities, 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So it's correct.

Wait, but wait a minute, the options don't have 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options again. The options are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, so 0.64 is close. Then 5/14 is about 0.357, which is close to 0.36. So that matches option A. But wait, let me look at the other options.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt7.

Hmm, our calculation gives probabilities of approx 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A’s first two probabilities.

Wait, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in computing the inner product.

Wait, I think I should double-check.

Wait, the inner product for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), leading to 9/14.

But wait, let me compute it again:

In the calculation of < +x | alpha >:

The coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7).

So adding (1+i) + (2 -i) gives 3.

Wait, that's correct.

So the inner product for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428.

Then the other probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but option A's first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, which matches our findings.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me confirm that the state |alpha> is correctly normalized.

The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

Compute the squared magnitude of each component:

(1+i) has magnitude sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2).

(2-i) has magnitude sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5).

So the squared norm is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 = 2 +5=7.

So the normalization is 1/sqrt(7), so yes, |alpha> is correctly normalized. So that part is correct.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is the expectation value, computed as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues lambda_+ = hbar/2 and lambda_- = -hbar/2, and probabilities p_+ and p_-, the expectation value is p_+ * lambda_+ + p_- * lambda_-.

So, from our earlier calculation, p_+ is 9/14, p_- is 5/14.

So,

<A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )

= [ (9 -5) / (14 * 2) ] hbar

= (4)/(28) hbar

= (1/7) hbar.

So <A> is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A's average value is hbar/7.

So according to that, option A would have 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. Which matches our calculations.

Wait, but let's confirm the average value another way to be sure.

Alternatively, express A in terms of the Pauli matrices. A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Now, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so in the computational basis, it swaps |up> and |down>.

But another way to compute <sigma_x> is to express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>, then compute the expectation value.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

Compute <sigma_x> = Tr (sigma_x rho ), where rho is |alpha><alpha|.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute in the computational basis.

Compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

sigma_x |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ |down> <up| + |up><down| ] |alpha>.

Wait, no, wait. sigma_x is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So when applied to |alpha>, it swaps |up> and |down>.

So,

sigma_x |alpha> = (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ) / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is:

( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) <down| ) * [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ) ] / sqrt(7) )

Wait, no, Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, <alpha| is the conjugate transpose of |alpha>, so in components:

|alpha> = [ a |up> + b |down> ] / sqrt(7), where a=1+i, b=2-i.

So <alpha| = [ a* <up| + b* <down| ] / sqrt(7).

So sigma_x |alpha> = [ a*sigma_x |up> + b sigma_x |down> ] / sqrt(7).

But sigma_x |up> = |down>, and sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So sigma_x |alpha> = [ a |down> + b |up> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = ( [ a* <up| + b* <down| ] / sqrt(7) ) * ( [ a |down> + b |up> ] / sqrt(7) ) )

= (1/7) [ a* <up| a |down> + a* <up| b |up> + b* <down| a |down> + b* <down| b |up> ]

Now, <up|down> is zero, <down|up> is zero, and <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1.

So cross terms involving <up|down> and <down|up> will be zero.

So,

= (1/7) [ a* a (0) + a* b (1) + b* a (0) + b* b (1) ]

= (1/7) [ a* b + b* a ]

Because the first term is a* a <up|down> which is zero, and the third term is b* a <down|up> which is zero.

So,

= (1/7) ( a* b + b* a )

Which is (1/7)( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) )

Compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i².

= 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So sum of the two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) )= 2.

Thus,

<sigma_x> = (1/7) * 2 = 2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches our earlier calculation.

So the average is hbar/7.

So, putting it all together:

Probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357) or 0.36 approx.

Average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's a match.

So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

Yes, that's exactly what we found.

So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared norm:
\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are given by the squared magnitudes of the projections of \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Compute the inner products:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9 - 5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match **Option A**.
