Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So, the planets are Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Oh wait, Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, but same radius. So the stars are similar in size but different in mass. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight, and the size of the planet relative to the star. But wait, the probability also depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability formula—let me recall. I think the probability that a planet transits is given by R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no—wait, more accurately, the geometric probability that we observe a transit is approximately (R_star / a), but only if the orbit is edge-on. But since the RV method doesn't require edge-on orbits, but just that the planet's velocity along our line of sight is measurable, the actual probability depends on the inclination. Oh, right! The probability P_transit is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but wait, no—wait, the exact formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximated as R_star / a.

But wait, in this question, the planets have already been detected via RV method, which tells us their minimum mass and orbital periods. But for the transit probability, the inclination of their orbits is a factor. The RV method doesn't require the orbit to be edge-on; it just needs the planet's velocity to have a component along our line of sight. So for the RV method, the inclination can vary, but for a transit, it needs to be very close to 90 degrees (edge-on). So the probability is based on whether the orbital plane is edge-on enough for us to see the transit. 

Wait, but the question says that they are trying to detect transits, so they need to pick the planet that's more likely to transit. So the transit probability depends on the star's radius, the planet's orbital distance, and the orientation of the orbit. Since the RV method doesn't require edge-on orbits, the inclination isn't known precisely. So the probability of transit depends on the orientation of the orbit, which is a factor we can't know from RV data alone. So, in the case where both planets have same mass, but different orbital parameters, which one would have a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) )? No, maybe that's part of the mass calculation. Let me think again.

The probability for a planet to transit is the area of the star as seen from Earth relative to the planet's orbit. So the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination. But since the inclination is random, the average probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of orbits that are edge-on enough. Wait, more accurately, the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits is (R_star / a) * (1 / (something)).

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the probability of a transit is (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it's just R_*/a. But wait, that can't be right because the inclination would matter. Oh, no, the (R_*/a) is the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star, but multiplied by the probability that the orbit is aligned edge-on enough for the transit to occur. Wait, perhaps another approach.

The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by the probability that the orbit's inclination is such that the transit occurs. Since the RV method doesn't require edge-on, the actual probability depends on the unknown inclination. But for the purposes of this question, I think we can assume that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the higher that ratio, the higher the chance of a transit.

Wait, that's a simplification, but perhaps it's sufficient for this problem. So since the stars have the same radius (R_1 = R_2), the probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a.

So the question is, which planet has a smaller a, because that would make R_star/a larger, increasing the transit probability.

But wait, the planets have the same mass. Let's think about Kepler's third law. The semi-major axis a is determined by the planet's orbital period and the mass of the star. Kepler's third law is a³ = (G(M_star + m_planet) * P² )/(4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + m_planet ≈ M_star.

So a³ ∝ (M_star) * P². So a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, M_1 = 2 M_2 (since Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's). Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 / 3. So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * ( (P2/3) )² )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3).

a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2²)^(1/3), since Planet_2's period is P2 and mass is M2.

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Wait, no: a2 is proportional to (M2 * (P2)^2 )^(1/3) = (M2 P2² )^(1/3).

a1 is proportional to (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3 ) = ( (2/9) * M2 P2² )^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2² )^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. Wait, no: since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2. Let me compute 2/9: 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 = 0.606 a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. That's important because the transit probability is (R_star / a), and since R is same, higher probability for smaller a.

So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so the transit probability would be R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2). Since R/a2 is the transit probability for Planet_2, Planet_1's is higher by ~1.65 times.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2 by a factor of about 1.65. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because its probability is higher.

Wait, but the options are about which has higher probability. Let me look at the options.

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option A is about Planet_2 having higher. Wait, let me see the options again.

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to 2.7 times.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So options C or D.

Wait, but in my calculation, the ratio is 1.65, so that's option C.

Wait, but wait—did I compute the a correctly?

Let me compute a1 and a2 more accurately.

a^3 proportional to M * P^2.

For Planet_1: M1=2, P1= P2/3.

So a1^3 ∝ 2 * (P2/3)^2 = 2 * P2² /9 = (2/9) P2².

For Planet_2: a2^3 ∝ 1 * P2².

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Which means that R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) = 1.65 (R/a2).

So transit probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So Planet_1 has higher probability. So the answer would be C, because the probability is ~1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, is the transit probability actually (R/a) * (something else)?

I think I might have forgotten that the probability also depends on the inclination. The transit probability is (R_* + R_p) / a * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5). But since both have circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So the probability is roughly (R_* + R_p)/a. But R_p is much smaller than R_*, so it's approx R_*/a.

But wait, another thought: the RV method gives the minimum mass, but we don't know the inclination. So for the RV method, the actual mass could be higher if the inclination is not 90 degrees. But for the transit probability, since the inclination is unknown, the probability is just based on the geometric possibility, which is (R_*/a).

So in this scenario, the probability is just R_*/a.

So since both stars have the same radius, and Planet_1 has a smaller a, its R/a is bigger, so higher probability.

So the conclusion is that Planet_1 is preferred because it has a higher transit probability by a factor of approximately 1.65, which is option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet, we calculate the semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2:

1. **Planet_1**: Host star mass \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2M_{\text{star,2}} \), orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).  
   \[
   a_1^3 \propto 2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9}P_2^2
   \]
   \[
   a_1 \propto \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot a_2 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2
   \]

2. **Planet_2**: Host star mass \( M_{\text{star,2}} \), orbital period \( P_2 \).  
   \[
   a_2^3 \propto 1 \cdot P_2^2
   \]
   \[
   a_2 \propto a_2
   \]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability by a factor of:

\[
\frac{\text{Probability for Planet_1}}{\text{Probability for Planet_2}} = \frac{R_{\text{star}}/a_1}{R_{\text{star}}/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
