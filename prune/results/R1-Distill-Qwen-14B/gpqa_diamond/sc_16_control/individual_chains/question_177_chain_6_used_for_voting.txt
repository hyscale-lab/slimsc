Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, how does that affect their luminosity? Oh, right, I remember that luminosity relates to both radius and temperature. Oh wait, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴. So luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right—the peak wavelength is related to the star's temperature via Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both λ_max are the same, then their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's a key point.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, how does radial velocity come into play here? Radial velocity is the speed at which a star moves towards or away from us. But since Star_1 has zero radial velocity, it's probably not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, I think. Or maybe moving towards? Wait, radial velocity can be either. But the problem doesn't specify direction, just the magnitude. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, it's the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, its light blueshifts; moving away, it redshifts. So the observed wavelength would change.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. But their actual temperatures might be different if one is moving. Let me think. Let's model this. Star_1 has no radial velocity, so its observed λ_max is the same as its actual λ_max. Star_2 is moving (say, receding) at 700 km/s, so its observed λ_max is longer due to redshift. But according to the problem, their observed λ_max are the same. So, how does this affect their actual temperatures?

Let me formalize this. Let’s denote:

- λ1_observed = λ1_actual (since radial velocity is 0)
- λ2_observed = λ2_actual * (1 + v2/c) [relativistic Doppler shift formula]
But wait, the problem says that λ1 and λ2 observed are the same. So λ1_actual = λ2_observed.

Wait, but for Doppler shift, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So λ2_observed = λ2_actual * (1 + v2/c), assuming v is positive when moving away. So λ2_observed = λ1_actual.

So λ2_actual = λ1_actual / (1 + v2/c).

But Wien's law says λ_max = b / T. So for Star_1, λ1 = b / T1. For Star_2, λ2 = b / T2.

But from the Doppler shift, λ2_actual = λ1_actual / (1 + v2/c). So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c)

Simplify that:

1/T2 = (1/(T1 (1 + v2/c)))

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, so the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by (1 + v2/c). Because if a star is moving away (v positive), its observed wavelength is longer, so actual λ is shorter. Because λ observed = λ actual * (1 + v/c) when moving away. So for Star_2, the actual λ is shorter than what is observed. Hence, λ2_actual = λ1_actual / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if Star_2's actual λ_max is smaller than Star_1's actual λ_max, then its temperature would be higher. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Oh, right. So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose Star_2 is moving away at speed v. So its observed wavelength is longer than its rest frame wavelength. So λ_observed = λ_actual * (1 + v/c). So λ_actual = λ_observed / (1 + v/c).

Since λ_max for both stars is the same (observed), λ_observed for both is the same. So λ1_actual = λ_observed, and λ2_actual = λ_observed / (1 + v2/c). So λ2_actual is smaller, meaning its temperature is higher.

So T2 = b / λ2_actual = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ_observed. And T1 = b / λ1_actual = b / λ_observed.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Now, the problem gives the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. So v2 is 700 km/s. But wait, what's the speed in terms of c? Let's compute v2/c.

The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So approximately 0.002333. So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than Star_1.

Now, the luminosity of each star is given by L = 4 π R² σ T^4. So for each star, L1 = 4 π R1² σ T1^4, L2 = 4 π R2² σ T2^4.

But wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of what? So L1 / L2 = ?

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = T1 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 T1.

Let me plug these into L1 and L2.

L1 = 4 π (1.5 R2)² σ T1^4 = 4 π R2² σ (2.25) T1^4.

L2 = 4 π R2² σ (T2)^4.

So L1 / L2 = [2.25 T1^4] / [ (T2)^4 ]

But T2 is approximately 1.002333 T1. So T2^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4 T1^4.

Let's compute (1.002333)^4. Let me approximate. Let me compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002333 - (0.002333)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.002333 - (0.00000544) ≈ 0.00232756. So ln(x) ≈ 0.00232756, so ln(x^4) = 4 * 0.00232756 = 0.00931025. So x^4 ≈ e^0.00931025 ≈ 1 + 0.00931025 + (0.00931025)^2/2 ≈ 1.009310 + 0.000043 ≈ 1.009353.

So T2^4 ≈ 1.009353 T1^4.

Thus, L1/L2 = (2.25 T1^4) / (1.009353 T1^4) ) = 2.25 / 1.009353 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 2.25 by approximately 1.009353.

2.25 / 1.009353 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.009353 times 2.225 is approximately 2.225 * 1.009353 = ?

Wait, alternatively, compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

1.009353 is approximately 1 + 0.009353.

So using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

Here, x = 0.009353, so 1/(1.009353) ≈ 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

Divide 2.25 by 1.009353.

Let me compute 1.009353 × 2.225.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 2.25 / 1.009353:

Compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

Let me do this division step by step.

1.009353 × 2.225 = ?

Wait, maybe compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

I can write this as 2.25 * (1/1.009353).

1 / 1.009353 ≈ approximately 0.99072.

So 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ 2.227.

Hmm, but perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1.009353 as 1.009353 and compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

Alternatively, let me compute 2.25 divided by 1.009353.

Let me figure out 1.009353 × 2.225:

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me use a calculator-like approach.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

First, note that 1.009353 = 1 + 0.009353.

Compute 2.25 / 1.009353.

Let me compute 1.009353 * 2.22 = ?

2.22 * 1 = 2.22

2.22 * 0.009353 = 2.22 * (0.009 + 0.000353) = 0.01998 + 0.000787 = 0.020767.

So 2.22 * 1.009353 ≈ 2.22 + 0.020767 = 2.240767.

But 2.240767 is just a bit less than 2.25. So 2.22 gives 2.240767.

The difference between 2.25 and 2.240767 is 0.009233.

So, to find how much more we need to add to 2.22 to reach 2.25.

Each 0.01 in the multiplier adds approximately 1.009353 * 0.01 = 0.01009353 to the product.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the multiplier is the factor we're seeking, which is the value of x where 1.009353 * x = 2.25.

We've tried x=2.22, which gives 2.240767. The difference is 0.009233.

We can compute how much delta_x is needed beyond 2.22 to cover that 0.009233.

delta_x * 1.009353 ≈ 0.009233.

delta_x ≈ 0.009233 / 1.009353 ≈ approximately 0.009145.

So x ≈ 2.22 + 0.009145 ≈ 2.229145.

So approximately 2.229.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this value.

Alternatively, is there a more precise way to compute (1.002333)^4?

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1) x²)/2 for small x.

Here, x is 0.002333, and n=4.

So (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3 * (0.002333)^2)/2.

Compute:

4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

(12 * (0.002333)^2 ) / 2 = 6 * (0.00000544) ≈ 0.0000326.

So total approximation: 1 + 0.009332 + 0.0000326 = 1.0093646.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093646.

So T2^4 / T1^4 = (1.002333)^4 = ~1.0093646.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) )= ( (1.5)^2 ) * (1 / 1.0093646 ) = 2.25 * (1 / 1.0093646 ) = 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

So L1 is about 2.23 times L2.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
2. **Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{max, observed}} \)).
3. **Temperature**: Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the actual temperature of Star_2 (\( T_2 \)) is higher than that of Star_1 (\( T_1 \)) due to the radial velocity of Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)). The Doppler shift formula gives:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2 / c)
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \):
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \right) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity ratio is given by:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = 1.002333 T_1 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 T_1^4}{(R_2)^2 (1.002333)^4 T_1^4} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]

5. **Approximation of \( (1.002333)^4 \)**: Using the binomial expansion for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):
   \[
   (1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x + \frac{4(4-1)x^2}{2} = 1 + 4x + 6x^2
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 0.002333 \):
   \[
   (1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + 6(0.002333)^2 \approx 1.0093646
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.0093646} \approx 2.229
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
