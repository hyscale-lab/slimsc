Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetics experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair and some Cre-lox constructs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that they've created a bicistronic vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So, two genes are being expressed from one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, and it's fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, and there are loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination with Cre. The stop cassette is probably a transcriptional stop, so without Cre, the stop is in place, preventing expression of the downstream gene. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so that should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor has an IRES upstream. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein, not dependent on the ligand's promoter. So, the ligand and receptor are both being expressed, but under different regulatory elements.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, so loading is correct. So, the proteins are being expressed, I guess. But when they crossed the homozygous mice to SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal under the microscope. The green is from eGFP. So, why isn't the green showing up?

Let me think about how the construct works. The vector is bicistronic, with the ligand first, then the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it should be expressed. But the ligand is fused to mCherry. Wait, no. Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So, the ligand's coding sequence is followed by mCherry? Or is it a fusion protein? Or maybe it's a separate expression. Wait, no, because the vector is bicistronic. Oh, wait, no: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So, maybe it's a fusion protein, ligand-mCherry. But the vector is a single transcript? Or two separate transcripts?

Wait, bicistronic vectors usually produce a single mRNA with two ORFs. But the two ORFs are under separate promoters or have internal ribosome entry sites. Here, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES. So, the mRNA is first translated for the ligand, then the ribosome can re-initiate at the IRES to make the receptor.

But the vector also has loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. So, I think the ligand is in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So, the 5' end has ligand ORF, then stop, then loxP. Then the receptor's ORF is after that. But the stop is between ligand and mCherry. Wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the construct is built. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, then a stop in a loxP cassette. Then the rest of the vector includes the receptor, which is after an IRES, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The stop before eGFP is in a lox2272 cassette.

So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression beyond them. So, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but only up to the stop. Wait, no, because the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but with a stop in the loxP cassette. So, without Cre, the mRNA for the ligand would have a stop, so the ligand isn't expressed? Or is the stop in the way so that the ligand is expressed but the mCherry is not? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The loxP-stop-loxP cassette is between the ligand ORF and the mCherry. So, in the absence of Cre, the mRNA would have the ligand's ORF, then a stop codon. So, the ligand would be expressed as a protein, but not followed by mCherry. Or wait, perhaps the ligand is part of a fusion with mCherry, but the stop is preventing that. So, when Cre isn't present, the stop is in place, so the ligand isn't expressed beyond the stop. Hmm, maybe the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so even with the stop, the ligand would be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the loxP cassettes are used for Cre-mediated excision. So, when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recognized, and the stop cassette is removed, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop would prevent that. Or, perhaps the stop is in the way, so mCherry isn't expressed because the stop is in the middle of the mRNA.

Alternatively, the ligand and mCherry are separate, but the stop is in between, so without Cre, the mCherry isn't expressed. If Cre is present, the stop is removed, so both ligand and mCherry are expressed.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Without Cre, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand's mRNA would be translated into a truncated protein that includes the ligand but stops before mCherry. Or perhaps the ligand is only expressed if Cre removes the stop.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this part. Let me think about the experiment. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and ran a Western blot. The blot shows the actin loading is correct, so they can see the proteins. But when they look for eGFP under the microscope, there's no green signal.

Wait, the eGFP is on the receptor construct. So, the issue is that the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or isn't fluorescent. So, why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell, so this might not explain the lack of fluorescence.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That could cause no fluorescence if the protein isn't at the cell surface. But why would it be stuck? Maybe because of the construct design.

Option C: enhancer missing. So, the promoter isn't working. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Also, the Western blot showed that proteins are expressed, so the promoter is working. Unless the receptor isn't being expressed. But the IRES is present, which should allow for expression regardless of the upstream promoter.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, right! If the receptor's ORF is in a different reading frame than the eGFP, then the two would not be expressed as a single protein. Because eGFP is at the C-terminus, if the frames don't match, the receptor might not be expressed, or the eGFP might not be either.

Wait, the question says that the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP. So, are they a single ORF, meaning the receptor is followed by eGFP in the same reading frame? If the frames don't match, then the eGFP might not be translated, or the receptor might not be either. So, on Western blot, when they tested the construct, perhaps they didn't see the eGFP, but maybe the receptor was expressed. But the Western blot data said the signal was proportional to actin, so maybe the blot detected the proteins. Unless the antibodies are specific.

Wait, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, if the eGFP isn't expressed, the antibody against it wouldn't show up. But in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests that their loading control is correct. But perhaps the blotting didn't show the eGFP, but the question isn't clear on that. The question only says that the green signal isn't observed in the offspring.

Wait, the experiment: they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes and used Western blot. So, perhaps the construct is expressed in the cells, but when they made a mouse model, they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells, I believe. So, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells, perhaps.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Then they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous. SOX10-Cre probably expresses Cre under the control of SOX10, which is active in certain cells, like neural crest derivatives.

In the offspring, Cre would recognize the lox sites. The construct has loxP and lox2272 sites; lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also cut, but maybe it's used for different recombination events.

So, in the construct, the ligand ORF is in a loxP stop cassette, and the receptor's ORF is in a lox2272 stop cassette. So, in the presence of Cre, both stops are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. So, ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP would be produced.

But when they look at the offspring under the microscope, there's no green signal. So, eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the receptor's ORF and eGFP are not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP might not be translated because it's not in the same reading frame. So, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no fluorescence.

Option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein is not at the cell surface. But the question doesn't mention any attempts to check for intracellular GFP. Also, the problem seems to be about expression, not trafficking.

But why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop is in place, or because the construct is not in frame.

Wait, in the plasmid construct, the initial setup is that the ligand is under CBA, then the stop, then the IRES, then the receptor-eGFP with another stop. So, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (because CBA promoter is active), but the mCherry wouldn't be, because the stop is there. The receptor would not be expressed because the IRES is before the stop.

Wait, but the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So, the IRES allows for the translation of the receptor, regardless of the upstream stop. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, because the IRES allows it. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but mCherry and eGFP are not.

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed. So, ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse, they crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre is active in neural crest cells. So, in those cells, the stops are removed. So, the ligand should be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But in the offspring, there's no green signal. So, eGFP isn't expressed. So, why?

Looking at the options, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because of frame shift.

Wait, if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP won't be translated as a separate protein. So, the construct would have the receptor's ORF followed by eGFP, but if not in frame, the eGFP won't be produced correctly. So, in the Western blot, perhaps the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't, so no fluorescence.

Alternatively, the presence of the stop in the lox2272 cassette means that in the absence of Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. So, when Cre is active (in the neural crest cells), the stop is removed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed. So, why isn't the eGFP present?

Wait, but the mouse is made homozygous for the construct. So, both alleles have the same vector. So, when Cre is present, both stops are excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed, leading to no fluorescence.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. IRES elements allow for translation without a Kozak sequence, but if the IRES is not functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But the question states that the ligand is under CBA, a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So, in the absence of Cre, the receptor should be expressed, but in the presence of Cre, perhaps mCherry and eGFP are expressed as well.

Wait, but the question is about the mouse model. They made a mouse homozygous for the construct. Then crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice, which would activate Cre in neural crest cells. So, in those cells, the ligand and receptor constructs should be expressed with their respective fluorescent tags.

So, why no green? Maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong. So, if the receptor is in one frame and eGFP in another, the eGFP isn't translated. So, the eGFP isn't present, so no fluorescence.

Another thing: the question mentions that the vector is bicistronic. So, perhaps each ORF is in a separate cassette. If the frames are wrong, the eGFP isn't made.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF for the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP won't be translated. So, the receptor might be expressed, but eGFP is not. So, in the Western blot, eGFP wouldn't be detected. But the question says the Western blot after transfection shows a signal proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. Wait, but if the eGFP isn't expressed, that might not show up on the blot. However, the question says the actin loading is correct, so the blot is working. But perhaps the reporter isn't present.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot detected the ligand and receptor, but not eGFP. But without knowing whether the blot probed for eGFP or another protein, it's hard to say.

But the main issue is why the eGFP isn't expressed. Another possibility is that the IRES didn't function, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to facilitate translation.

Wait, but the vector design: the ligand is under CBA promoter, then stop, then IRES, then receptor. So, when the stop is removed by Cre, the mRNA would have the ligand followed by mCherry and then the IRES and receptor.

No, wait, the ligand is in the 5' ORF, so the mRNA is CBA-driven, and then the IRES allows for translation of the receptor downstream. So, without the stop, the ligand can be expressed, then the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, maybe the construct is such that the IRES is after the ligand and the stop, and then the receptor is after that. So, the presence of Cre would remove the stop between ligand and mCherry, and the stop between receptor and eGFP. So, ligand-mCherry would be expressed, and receptor-eGFP would be expressed.

But if the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, then the eGFP wouldn't be made, so no fluorescence. So, the answer would be option D.

Another angle: the antibodies were made against the overexpressed proteins. So, perhaps the Western blot confirms that the proteins are expressed, but without knowing which, perhaps the eGFP wasn't expressed. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin, which is just a loading control; it doesn't confirm specific proteins.

So, the most likely reason is option D, that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand-receptor pair, where the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites are present between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. Cre recombination is expected to remove these stops, allowing expression of the fusion proteins. However, after crossing the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre mice, no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed under the microscope.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: A paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor would not explain the lack of fluorescence, as the question focuses on expression within the same cell. This option is unlikely.

- **Option B**: If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, but there is no evidence provided to support this. Additionally, the issue appears to be related to expression rather than trafficking.

- **Option C**: The enhancer for expression is not missing, as the ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is driven by the IRES element. The Western blot confirms protein expression, ruling out this option.

- **Option D**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be translated as a separate protein. This would result in the absence of fluorescence, as observed in the experiment. This explanation aligns with the experimental setup and results.

The most likely reason for the lack of fluorescence is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, preventing eGFP expression.
