Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a particular relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Alright, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, so the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (r) in parsecs. So plx = 1/r.

Wait, so if plx is proportional to 1/r, then 1/(plx) would be proportional to r. Right, because 1/(1/r) is r. But in this case, it's 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that out: N ∝ (plx)^-5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N ∝ (1/r)^-5. Which is the same as N ∝ r^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. (1/r)^-5 is the same as (r^-1)^-5, which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the total number and the number per unit distance.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). So in a given region, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ r^5. So if you go farther away, the number of stars you see increases as r^5. But wait, that doesn't seem right because stars are more dense nearby.

Wait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the number of stars per unit volume? Or is it the number of stars per unit area at a certain distance?

Wait, perhaps I should think about flux or density. Let me think. The number of stars you observe in a certain region depends on how many are present at that distance and how much of their light reaches us. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the volume. The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πr² dr) multiplied by the number density of stars at that distance. But in this problem, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5. So maybe the number density (number per volume) is varying with distance.

Wait, let me try to model this. Let's say that the number of stars in a region is given by N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, substitution gives N = k r^5. So for a given small change in distance dr, how does N change?

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is asking about the differential: the number of stars per unit distance. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a small range dr around r would be dN = (dN/dr) dr. So what is dN/dr?

Calculating dN/dr: If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase as r^4. Hmm, but wait the options don't have r^4 as the correct answer. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Wait, option C is r^4. So if dN/dr ∝ r^4, then the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the number of stars in a region as you go to larger distances (per unit distance) increases with r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, r^4.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = A / (plx)^5, where A is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, this implies N = A r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the total number of stars up to a distance r would be proportional to r^5. But when we're talking about per unit distance, it's the derivative. So dN/dr = 5 A r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN) increases as r^4. So the answer should be C.

But wait, another approach. Maybe the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance. Because, in reality, stars are more concentrated in the galaxy's plane, but perhaps this problem is in a specific region where the density changes in a certain way.

Wait, but the question says "in a specific region of the sky." So maybe it's a region where the number density of stars varies with distance. If N varies as r^5, which is a very steep increase, that's quite unusual. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a given volume is being considered. The number density (stars per volume) could be N/(volume). Volume is proportional to r^3 (since volume of a sphere is 4/3 π r^3). So if N ∝ r^5, then number density would be (r^5)/(r^3) ) = r^2. So number density would go as r^2. But the question isn't about number density; it's about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the number of stars is a function of distance. The problem says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by a factor of 5 r^4. So the change per unit r is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think about the units. The number of stars (N) is proportional to r^5. So when r increases by a small amount dr, the change dN is 5 r^4 dr. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the per unit distance increase in the number of stars is proportional to r^4, which matches option C.

So the correct answer should be C, r^4.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases steeply with distance as \( r^5 \).

However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the change in the number of stars per unit distance. Starting from \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.
