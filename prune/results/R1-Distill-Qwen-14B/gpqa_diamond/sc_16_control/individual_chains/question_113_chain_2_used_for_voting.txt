Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectra. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the molecular formula among the options provided.

First, looking at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids maybe. Oh wait, if it's a broad peak, it's probably an -OH group. So the compound has an -OH, which suggests the presence of either an alcohol, phenol, or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. So probably an alcohol or phenol.

Then there are peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is strong for carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated enone? The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation—like in alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, because the conjugation lowers the carbonyl stretching frequency. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester or something like that.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. There are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, probably in a conjugated system because of the FTIR. So maybe it's something like an enol or an enone structure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment, like the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group. 45 is 9 + 36, but wait, the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO is 58, but that's not relevant. Wait, 45 could be (CH2O) or something else. Wait, wait: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH3? No, that's 60. Wait, 45 is C3H7O? Wait, no. Let me think. 45 could be a fragment like (CH2)2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another common fragment is the CH2=CH+ which is 29, but that's not 45. Hmm, another possibility is the (CHO) group. Wait, the molecular formula for formaldehyde is 30, so maybe not. Wait, maybe it's a ketene or something else. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be CH2CH2O, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait. Another approach. Let's think about the options given. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So the possible formulas are derivatives of benzene rings or aliphatic compounds.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. That could be something like methyl benzoate, which has an ester group (which would show up at ~1700 cm⁻¹), and maybe an -OH as well. Or it could be something else with two oxygen atoms, like a diol ester or a cyclic ester. Alternatively, it could be a compound with a ketone and an alcohol, but that's less likely. Wait, but FTIR had a broad peak, so O-H is present.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a molecular formula which could be a cyclohexene derivative with one oxygen, like an alcohol. For example, cyclohexene with an -OH group. Or maybe a diene with an alcohol.

Option C: C6H10O2. This could be something with two oxygen atoms, like an acid or ester. For example, if it's an ester, the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak would make sense. The O-H could be from another group, like an alcohol or phenol.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen, maybe an alcohol. So, for example, a cyclic ether like cyclohexanol, but that's an ether, which wouldn't have an O-H. Wait, no, cyclohexanol would have an O-H. So the FTIR peak fits.

So back to the FTIR. Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ implies O-H. The 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest conjugated carbonyl groups. So the compound probably has an carbonyl group, maybe conjugated with a double bond.

In the 1H NMR, vinyl protons—so maybe a conjugated diene or an enone system.

Now, considering the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's think of what molecular ions could break down to a fragment of 45. For example, if the molecular weight is around 100 (since the options are all in the 90s or so?), then a fragment of 45 could come from losing some part.

Wait, another approach: what common structures have a 45 fragment? Let's think: 45 is the same as the molecular weight of CH2O (formaldehyde is 30, but maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O is 45? No, wait: (CH3)2O is 45? Let's calculate: carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So (CH3)2O is (12*2) + (6*1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. So not 45.

Wait, maybe a fragment of CHO (formaldehyde is 30) but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe a ketene group, but I don't recall the exact fragments.

Another possibility is that the 45 is a CH2=CH-O group. Wait, CH2=CHO- would have a molecular weight of 45? Let's see: CH2=CHO is C2H3O. So 2*12 +3*1 +16=24+3+16=43. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CH-O-R group, but that depends on the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a fragment like C3H7O. Wait, 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=60. No. Hmm, perhaps the 45 is a CO group plus something else. Wait, CO is 28 (12+16). Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 12*2 + 2*1 +16= 24+2+16=42. No, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment from the parent ion losing something. Let's think about the molecular formulas. Let's take each option and see what their possible molecular ions would be.

Option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32=114 g/mol.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. Now, what fragments could come from this? Let's see. Maybe the molecule breaks into a fragment of 45 and another part. 114 -45=69. So a fragment of 45 and 69. What's 69? Maybe something like C4H9O? 4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73. No. Alternatively, 69 could be a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is not directly from the main chain but from a substituent.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the 45 is a common fragment for an ester group. Let's think about an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. The ester carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹, which fits the IR data. So if the compound is an ester, maybe the fragment at 45 comes from the ester group breaking down.

Wait, when an ester breaks down, what happens? The ester can cleave into an acid and an alcohol, but in the mass spec, the fragments are more likely to be from the more stable parts. Alternatively, the ester group may lose a part, like the R-O- part.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 comes from a CH2CH2O- group. Wait, but earlier I saw that CH2CH2O would be 42. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something. Wait, another approach: think about the molecular formula. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. So the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the compound is an ester, the general formula for an ester is CnH2nO2. Let's see: C6H10O2. That would imply n=5? Because for an ester, the formula is (R-O-CO-R') which would be (CnH2n+1O) (COO) (CmH2m+1). So the total would be C(n+m+2) H(2n+2m+2) O2. Hmm, not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone. Lactones would have ester groups and a ring structure. So if it's a cyclic ester, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700, which fits.

In the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests double bonds. So if the compound is a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a cyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have conjugated carbonyl, which would lower the wavenumber to about 1650 cm⁻¹. That matches the IR data: peaks at 1700 and 1650.

So the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have a conjugated carbonyl, which explains the lower wavenumber. The FTIR then would have the ester carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond's C=C at around 1650.

Now, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so that would be the protons on the double bond. In an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the vinyl protons would be deshielded and appear downfield, maybe around 5-6 ppm. Such a structure would fit.

Now, the mass spec. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule. Let me think about possible fragments. For an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment and the bigger part. For example, if the molecule is something like methyl cyclopentene-carboxylate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO. Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a molecular weight of 58, so that's not right. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think of possible structures. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. Possible structures include methyl cyclopentane carboxylate, but that would have a larger ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclopentene ring with an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like methyl 3-oxopentenoate or similar. Wait, maybe the structure is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester.

Alternatively, let's consider the possible fragment. 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like CH2=CH-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the structure that would have both an ester group and an O-H group. Oh wait, but wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak, so O-H is present. If the compound is an ester and an alcohol, that would require two oxygen atoms, which is the case for option C (O2). Wait, but if it's an ester, it's O2. Alternatively, if it's an ester and a phenol group, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, but in the options, only option C has two oxygen atoms. The others have O or O2.

Wait, but the problem states that FTIR shows O-H (from the broad peak) and the carbonyl (from 1700 and 1650). So the compound must have both an O-H group and a carbonyl group.

Which of the options have both O and a carbonyl?

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2 → O2, possible ester or ketone plus something else. But if it's an ester, that uses two O's. So perhaps the O-H is from another group, but that would require three O's. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, no. If the molecule is an ester (which has two O's) and also has an -OH group, that would require three O's. So that's not possible unless the formula includes an extra O, which isn't in option A or C.

Wait, wait, no, because the ester has two O's. So if the compound is an ester and an alcohol, that would require three O's. But none of the options have three O's. So perhaps the O-H is part of the same group as the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Or maybe a ketone with an adjacent -OH group. But then, where would the carbonyl be? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a conjugated carbonyl and an -OH group in a structure that allows both. For example, an enol ether or something else.

Wait, but let's think again about the options.

Option C: C6H10O2 → two O's.

So if the molecule has both an ester group (two O's) and an -OH, that would require three O's, which isn't present. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a ketone group and an -OH. A ketone uses one O, and the -OH uses another. So two O's in total, which would fit option B or D.

But wait, option B is C6H10O, which has one O. So that can't have both a ketone and an -OH. So that's not possible.

Option D: C6H12O → one O. So can't have both a ketone and an -OH.

So the only option that has two O's is option C and A.

Wait, option A: C6H12O2 → two O's. So perhaps it's a structure with both an ester (two O's) and an -OH. But wait, that would require three O's, so that's not possible. So if the molecule has two O's, it can't have both an ester (two O's) and an -OH. So that leaves me confused.

Wait, perhaps the O-H isn't from an alcohol but from a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid has an O-H and a carbonyl group. So in that case, the formula would include two O's. Let's think: a carboxylic acid has formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So the molecular formula for a six-carbon carboxylic acid would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

So the FTIR would have the broad O-H from the carboxylic acid (broad around 3000 cm⁻¹) and the carbonyl at around 1700 cm⁻¹. But wait, why is there a peak at 1650 cm⁻¹? Carboxylic acids have the carbonyl around 1700. Maybe the 1650 is from something else, like a conjugated double bond. But then, in the NMR, vinyl hydrogens are present. So the compound would have a conjugated double bond.

So if the compound is a substituted benzoic acid, perhaps with a double bond? Wait, but then the molecular formula for benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which doesn't match the options. Alternatively, alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

For example, something like acrylic acid (but that's three carbons). Or maybe a longer chain with a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Because a six-carbon chain with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group: for example, pent-4-enoic acid. Wait, let's see: the formula of pent-4-enoic acid is C5H8O2. But the option is C6H10O2. Hmm, so maybe a six-carbon structure with a double bond and a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula. A six-carbon carboxylic acid would be C6H12O2 (like hexanoic acid), but if it has a double bond, it would lose two H's, making it C6H10O2. So that would fit option C.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the IR would show the O-H (broad peak) and the carbonyl at ~1700. The conjugated double bond would have a peak at around 1650. That fits the IR data.

In the NMR, the vinyl protons would be present, as observed. So, that fits.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, what about the mass spec? The fragment at m/z=45. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of some part.

Wait, another approach: what is the molecular ion? For option C, it's C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114.

In the mass spec, a fragment at 45 would be 45. So what is 45 in this context?

Hmm. Let's think of possible fragments. Maybe the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment and another part. For a six-carbon compound, perhaps it breaks into a three-carbon and a three-carbon fragment. 45 is 45, 114-45=69. So the other fragment would be 69.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage of the ester group. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the ester isn't present. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the fragment could be from losing the COOH group, but that's 44 (COOH is 44?), but not exactly.

Wait, the COOH group is 44 (12+16*2=44). So if the molecule breaks at the COOH, the fragment would be (C6H10O2 → COOH (44) + (C5H9O). But 44 plus 73 gives 117, which is over, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the double bond. For a conjugated dienoic acid, the molecule could fragment to form a carbonyl fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a result of the alpha cleavage.

Wait, in mass spectrometry, for carboxylic acids, the most common fragments are the loss of CO2, but that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not a carboxylic acid but an ester.

Wait, let's pivot. If the compound is an ester, with formula C6H10O2, what structure would it have? For example, an ester with a conjugated double bond.

So, for example, methyl pent-4-enoate. Its structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a conjugated system. So the NMR would have the vinyl protons, and the IR would have the ester carbonyl and conjugated double bond.

So, if the ester is part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated C=C at about 1650. The O-H is not from the ester but maybe from another group. Wait, but if the ester is the only oxygen, and the compound has an O-H, that would require three O's, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is in the ester group. No, that doesn't make sense because esters don't have O-H; they have OR and O-CO-O.

Hmm, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group. But then, the compound would be a phenol ester, which would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a diol. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol and the carbonyl is from a ketone. But then, how many O's would that require? The formula would have O=2 if it's an ester plus an -OH. No, that's not possible because that would require three O's, which isn't present.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the mass spec fragment again. If the fragment is 45, what could that be from option C (C6H10O2)?

The molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the molecule breaks into a fragment with a molecular weight of 45, then the rest would be 114-45=69. 69 could be C5H11O or similar. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for the fragment 45 would be C3H7O. Because 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=60? No, that's 60, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is C2H5O2? No, that's 2*12 +5 +32=24+5+32=61. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is C3H3O, which is 3*12 +3*1 +16=36+3+16=55. Still not 45.

Wait, 45 is 9 + 36. So maybe it's a methyl group (15) plus something else. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe it's a tropylium ion, but that's typically for aromatic compounds. If the compound is aromatic, but the molecular formula is C6H10O2, that would be like a substituted benzene. For example, benzoic acid would be C7H6O2, but this is C6, so perhaps a cyclohexene with a COOH group.

Hmm, let's think about another possibility. The fragment at m/z 45 could be the result of a McLafferty rearrangement. Wait, McLafferty typically occurs in ketones with an alpha H, leading to a fragment at m/z = (M - 31). So if the parent ion is M, McLafferty would give a fragment of M-31. So if the fragment is 45, then M would be 76. But our options are much larger (e.g., 114 for option C), so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a different process. Perhaps it's a neutral loss.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be from a CH2=CH-O group. Let's compute its molecular weight. CH2=CH-O is (12+2)+(12+2+16) → wait, wait, CH2=CH-O- is C2H3O. So molecular weight is (2*12)+(3*1)+16=24+3+16=43. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHOCH3. No, that's more than 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene group (O=C=O), but that's 64. No, not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a fragment from an ester cleavage. For example, an ester (RCOOR') might break into RCOO+ and R'–. The RCOO+ would have a molecular weight of RCOO.

Wait, for an ester like RCOOR', if it breaks after the carbonyl, you could get RCOO+ and R'–. The RCOO+ would be the molecular weight of RCOO. For example, if R is CH2CH2, RCOO would be (CH2CH2)COO → (12*3 + 2*1) +16*2 = 36 +2 +32=70. Not 45.

Alternatively, if R is methyl, then RCOO is 44 (CH3COO is 44), so the fragment would be 44, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a result of a ring opening. For example, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), the cleavage would break the ring, perhaps producing a fragment with a lower mass. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For option C, the molecular weight is 114. Losing a 69 fragment (114-45=69) would require a 69 fragment. 69 is C5H11O? Let me check: 5*12=60, 11*1=11, 16= O → 60+11+16=87. No, that's over. Alternatively, 69 could be C4H9O2? 4*12=48, 9=9, 2*16=32 → 48+9+32=89. No.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Let's consider that the 45 is from a small fragment like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. But acetone is 58, which is higher than 45. Not helpful.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. So, 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, two oxygen. So, if the structure is something like methyl cyclopent-2-enoate. The structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to a cyclopentene ring. But wait, cyclopentene is 5 carbons, plus the ester group (COOCH3) would make 8 carbons. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a six-membered ring. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2. Hmm, but that would be more than six carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 would be too long.

Hmm. I'm stuck on the mass spec part. Let's try to think of other clues.

The 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond, likely conjugated with the carbonyl group, as the IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So, an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So the structure is probably something like RCO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 or similar, but with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought. The ester group is O-CO-O. So, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be COOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. So maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's 11 carbons, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a ring. For example, a cyclic ester with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted acrylic ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's 4 carbons in the ester (COOCH2CH2CH2CH3) plus the three from the acrylate: that's 7 carbons, but the formula is C6, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a butyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. That's 2 (from CH2=CHCOO) + 4 (from butyl) → 6 carbons. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Wait, let's compute the formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3.

CH2=CHCOO- (which is 3 carbons) → C3H4O2.

Then, the ester would be R-O-CO-O-R', but no, wait, ester is RCOOR'. So in this case, R is CH2=CHCOO- and R' is CH2CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no. R is CH2=CHCOO- as the acid part, and R' is CH2CH2CH2CH3 as the alcohol part. So the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3.

So the molecular formula would be:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 → C3H5O2 (from the acid part) + C4H9 (from the alcohol part) → C7H14O2. Hmm, that's more than the options.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should think about the possible mass fragments again.

Option C is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is 114.

The fragment at 45 would mean that the molecule lost 69, which is 114-45=69. The 69 fragment could be C5H11O (114-45=69 → 69- (5*12 +11 +16)= 69- (60+11+16)= 69-87= -18. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, 69 could be C4H9O2 → 4*12 +9 +32=48+9+32=89. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a different part. Maybe the molecule breaks into two parts: 45 and 69. 45 might be (CH3)2CO, which is 58, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2=CH-O- group, which is C2H3O, 43. Close, but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is a carbonyl group plus something. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The problem says that the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Which of the options can lose a fragment of 45?

Option C: C6H10O2 → 114. If it loses 45, the remaining is 69.

Does 69 make sense as a fragment?

Looking up common fragments, 69 is the molecular weight of phenol (C6H5OH is 94, so no), or maybe of something like cycloheptatriene, but not sure.

Alternatively, 69 could be a pentyl group (C5H11, which is 72), but that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a result of the ester group breaking off. For example, if the ester group is part of the molecule, losing it would leave the rest. For an ester RCOOR', the loss of RCOO would leave R'.

In option C, if the ester is, say, methyl ester (COOCH3), then the loss of COOCH3 (which is 44) would leave a fragment of 114-44=70. But the observed fragment is 45, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is ethyl. COOCH2CH3 is 74. So loss would be 114-74=40, which is close to 45 but not exact.

Hmm.

Maybe it's not the ester breaking off. Another possibility is that the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which typically leads to a loss of 31 (as in C3H6O). But 45 is not a standard McLafferty fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a hydrogen shift during the fragmentation.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is the result of the loss of a methyl group and other parts. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me consider the options again. The problem is to choose between four options based on the given data.

From the IR: O-H (broad) and conjugated carbonyl (1700 and 1650). So, likely, the compound has a carbonyl group and an O-H group.

The NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond is present, probably conjugated with the carbonyl.

The mass spec has a peak at 45. Let's think about each option's possible structure and see which one fits.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures: ester or carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be RCOOH with a double bond. Let's say it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. So the formula is C6H10O2. The IR would have the O-H (broad) and the conjugated carbonyl (1700 and 1650). The NMR would have vinyl protons. So this fits.

In the mass spec, what would be the fragments? The molecular ion is 114. If the molecule breaks at the COOH group, perhaps losing CO2 (44), leaving 70. But the observed fragment is 45, not 70.

Alternatively, perhaps it breaks at the double bond. For example, the molecule could cleave after the double bond, leaving a fragment with the COOH group and some carbons.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, the mass spec could produce a fragment where the COOH is attached to a shorter chain. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH (which is C5H8O2, molecular weight 100). But that's larger than 45.

Alternatively, the fragment could be the CH2=CHCH2- group (which is C3H5, 41) but that's not 45.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another angle. The Mass Spec fragment at 45 could be a result of a loss from the molecular ion. For example, the molecule losing a group with a molecular weight of 69 (114 –45=69).

But what's a group with 69? Maybe a hexenyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CHCOOH (which is 72), but 72 is larger than 45.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. The other options are:

A) C6H12O2 → possible ester without double bonds. But the NMR says there are vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. So a structure without a double bond would have no vinyl protons. So option A is less likely.

Option B: C6H10O → with one O. So can't have both O-H and carbonyl groups. So the IR data suggests two O-containing groups, so option B is out.

Option D: C6H12O → one O. Same reasoning as B, so probably not.

So the only option that fits the IR, NMR, and has two oxygen atoms is option C: C6H10O2.

Even though I'm not entirely sure about the mass spec fragment, the other data points strongly suggest option C. The presence of O-H, carbonyl, and vinyl protons all fit with a conjugated alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester. Option C is the only formula that allows for both O-H and carbonyl groups.

The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Data:
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **Peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹**: Suggest a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system, as the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is lower than a typical carbonyl, indicating conjugation (e.g., an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl).

### ¹H NMR Data:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** (protons on a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond, likely conjugated with the carbonyl group.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This could correspond to a common fragment such as CH₂=CHO or a related structure.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
   - This formula suggests a compound with two oxygen atoms, possibly an ester or carboxylic acid. However, the molecular formula does not account for a double bond (since it has 12 hydrogens, which is saturated). The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR rules this out.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
   - This formula has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the presence of both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. The IR data requires two oxygen-containing groups, so this option is invalid.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
   - This formula has two oxygen atoms, consistent with the IR data (O-H and carbonyl). The presence of 10 hydrogens suggests a double bond, aligning with the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens). A possible structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester, which would explain the conjugated system observed in the IR spectrum. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 could arise from a common fragment of this type of compound.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
   - This formula has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the IR data. Additionally, the molecular formula suggests a saturated compound, which contradicts the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data are most consistent with **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it accounts for the O-H group, the conjugated carbonyl system, and the vinyl hydrogens. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is also plausible for this type of compound.
