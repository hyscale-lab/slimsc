Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. The closer the planet, the shorter the period.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. I guess if one star is more massive but same size, it must be hotter or something? Not sure if that matters here.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so which is more likely to pass in front from our view.

I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something else?) Wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital distance. Oh right! The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, squared. Or wait, no, maybe it's just the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to be at the right angle for us to see the transit.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability P is (R*/a)², where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance) of the planet. Or wait, is it P = (R*/a)^2 multiplied by something else? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance, as a geometric probability.

Right, the transit probability is given by (R*/a)^2, where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star. Because the planet has to be in the right part of its orbit (the plane has to align with our line of sight), and the chance is proportional to the ratio squared.

So both stars have the same radius, R*, so R*/a is the key factor. So we need to find the semi-major axes of each planet.

Wait, but how do we find a from the given information? We know the orbital periods and the mass of the stars. Using Kepler's third law, which is (T)^2 = (4π²/G(M*)) * a^3. So, a^3 is proportional to T^2 * M*. So a = [ (T^2 * M*) / (4π²/G) ]^(1/3). But maybe we can avoid the constants by comparing the two planets.

Let's denote:
For Planet_1:
P1 = Period = T
M1 = Mass of star = 2M (since it's twice that of Planet_2's star)
For Planet_2:
P2 = 3T (because Planet_1's period is three times shorter)
M2 = M (half the mass of Star 1)

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's law: a^3 = (G * M * P^2) / (4π²). But since we're comparing a1 and a2, the constants will cancel out.

a1^3 = (M1) * (P1)^2
a2^3 = (M2) * (P2)^2

Substituting M1 = 2M and M2 = M, and P2 = 3P1.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, P1 is Planet_1's period, which is T. P2 is Planet_2's period, which is 3T.

So a1^3 = (2M) * (T)^2
a2^3 = (M) * (3T)^2 = M * 9T² = 9 M T²

So a1^3 = 2 M T²
a2^3 = 9 M T²

Dividing a1^3 / a2^3 = (2)/(9) → (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2 is about 8^(1/3) is 2, 9 is 3^2.

So 2/9 = (2)/(3^2) → cube root of that is (2)^(1/3)/(3^(2/3)).

Alternatively,

a1 = (2 M T²)^(1/3)
a2 = (9 M T²)^(1/3)

So a1 = cube root(2) * (M T²)^(1/3)
a2 = cube root(9) * (M T²)^(1/3)

So a1/a2 = cube_root(2) / cube_root(9) = cube_root(2/9) ≈ cube_root(0.222) ≈ 0.606.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute a1 and a2 numerically.

a1^3 = 2 M T²
a2^3 =9 M T²

So a1 = (2 M T²)^(1/3)
a2 = (9 M T²)^(1/3)

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a2 is larger than a1, which makes sense since Planet_1 has a shorter period and is around a more massive star, but Planet_2's period is longer, so it's further out.

Wait, but wait a second: if the star is more massive, for the same period, the planet would have to be at a smaller orbit, right? Because more massive star would mean stronger gravity, so for same period, smaller a. But in our case, Planet_1 has shorter period, so a is smaller than Planet_2's a.

Wait, so for the same star mass, a shorter period implies a smaller a. So here, Planet_1 has shorter period, so a1 is smaller. But in our case, M1 is larger. So how does that balance out?

Wait, the a1 and a2 are not just based on period but also the star's mass. So let's think about the ratio of a1 to a2.

We have a1^3 = 2 * (T)^2
a2^3 = 9 * (3T)^2 → Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the formula for a^3 is (G M P^2)/(4π²). So for each planet:

a1^3 ∝ M1 * P1^2 → 2 * T^2

a2^3 ∝ M2 * P2^2 → 1 * (3T)^2 = 9 T^2

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 T²) / (9 T²) )= 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^1/3 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a2 is larger.

Now, the transit probability is P = (R*/a)^2. Since R* is same for both stars, then P1/P2 = (R* / a1)^2 / (R* / a2)^2 ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Because P is proportional to (R*/a)^2.

So a1 is 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, let me compute this again.

P1 = (R*/a1)^2.

P2 = (R*/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) = (a2/a1)^2.

We found a1/a2 = 0.606 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.65 → (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 ≈ 2.72. So P1 is about 2.7 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a2 is larger, then R*/a2 would be smaller, so P2 would be smaller. So P1 (planet_1) would have higher probability.

Wait, let me clarify.

If a is larger, then R*/a is smaller, so (R*/a)^2 is smaller, so lower probability. So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so higher transit probability.

So P1 is higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So which option says that? Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2 preferred, ~2.25x higher prob.

B) Planet_2, ~1.5x.

C) Planet_1, ~1.65x.

D) Planet_1, ~2.7x.

Wait, according to our calculation, P1 is higher than P2 by approximately 2.7 times. So the probability is higher for Planet_1.

So the correct choice is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

We have a1 = (2 * T² * M1 )^(1/3) → perhaps I should think in terms of a being proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So a1 = k * (2 * T²)^(1/3), and a2 = k * (1 * (3T)^2)^(1/3) ) = k * (9 T²)^(1/3).

So a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * T^(2/3),

a2= k*(9)^(1/3) * T^(2/3).

So a1/a2 = [ (2)^(1/3) ] / [ (9)^(1/3) ] = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606, as before.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So R*/a1 is higher than R*/a2, so (R*/a1)^2 is higher.

Thus, P1 = (R*/a1)^2,

P2 = (R*/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) = (a2/a1)^2.

a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, and in fact about 2.7 times higher.

So the correct option is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R^*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \( R^* \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R^* \)), the key factor is the ratio \( a_1 / a_2 \), where \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) are the semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2, respectively.

### Step 1: Relating semi-major axes to orbital periods and stellar masses
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to:

\[
a^3 \propto M^* \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1^3 \propto M_1 \cdot P_1^2 = 2M \cdot T^2
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2^3 \propto M_2 \cdot P_2^2 = M \cdot (3T)^2 = 9M \cdot T^2
\]

Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2M \cdot T^2}{9M \cdot T^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Calculating transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( (R^*/a)^2 \). Since \( R^* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities \( P_1 / P_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \( a_1 / a_2 \approx 0.606 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 2.25.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **C)** Incorrect. Planet_1 is preferred, but the probability ratio is not 1.65.
- **D)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 2.7.

### Final Answer:
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1 due to its significantly higher transit probability.
