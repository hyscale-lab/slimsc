Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, which aren't physical. You introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the math manageable, then remove it later. But some theories might not need this because they're finite or something else.

Let me go through each option:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's not a quantum theory. Classical theories don't usually have the same issues as quantum ones. But wait, do they have any divergences? Like in electromagnetism, when you calculate the self-energy of a charge, you get infinite charges or something? Oh wait, but that's in the quantum version. In classical E&M, perhaps not. Because in classical theory, you have Maxwell's equations which are well-behaved. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences that quantum theories do.

Wait, but when does regularization happen? It's a quantum field theory tool. So if a theory doesn't need regularization, maybe it's because it's a classical theory, or because it's a theory that's already finite (like maybe a conformal theory or something?).

Wait, let's think about each option:

A) Superstring Theory: I think string theories are supposed to be finite. Or wait, do they require regularization? I'm not too sure. I remember that string theory deals with high energies and different dimensions, but I'm not certain if it needs regularization. Maybe not, but I'm not confident.

B) QCD: Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong force. I think QCD does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. But wait, QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. So maybe it doesn't have the same issues as QED? Or does it still need regularization? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, QCD uses things like lattice regularization, I think. So it does require regularization.

C) QED: Quantum Electrodynamics definitely requires regularization. When you calculate processes like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergences. So you need to regularize, like using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, etc. Then renormalize to absorb the infinities.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: Since it's classical, no regularization is needed. Because regularization is a quantum thing. Also, in classical ED, maybe the Maxwell equations don't have the same divergent loop integrals as in QED. So this theory doesn't require regularization.

So the question is, which theory never needs regularization? If it's a classical theory, D is the answer. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. The other options are quantum theories, so they probably need regularization. Except maybe string theory?

Wait, is superstring theory a quantum theory? Yes, since it's an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with gravity. So it's a theory that quantizes strings. But I'm not sure about whether it requires regularization. I think string theory might not require it because it's background-independent or maybe the calculations are finite. Or perhaps because it's a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as QED or QCD. I'm not too certain about this.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D, classical E&M. Because among the options, it's the only one that is classical, so it doesn't have the divergences that require regularization.

So putting it all together: the question is about which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is needed in quantum theories to deal with divergences. So the only theory that doesn't need it would be the classical one.

So the answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics with gravity by quantizing strings. While it is a highly advanced theory, it is still a quantum framework and may require regularization to handle divergences, though this is not definitively clear.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and is a quantum field theory. It deals with divergences in loop diagrams and requires regularization techniques, such as lattice regularization, to handle these issues.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It is well-known to require regularization due to divergences in processes like electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. Regularization is a standard part of QED calculations.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory based on Maxwell's equations. It does not involve quantum concepts like divergences or infinities in loop integrals, which are the primary reasons regularization is needed in quantum theories. Therefore, it does not require regularization.

Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, the only theory among the options that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
