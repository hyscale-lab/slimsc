Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT, and I need to figure out which ones must be respected by all operators. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries, right?

The question gives four options about what symmetries are required. Let's go through them one by one. The options are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? I think Lorentz symmetry has to do with transformations between different inertial frames, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. But if the theory is invariant under Poincare, it must also be Lorentz invariant, right? So if all operators must respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But does the SMEFT require Poincare symmetry?

I remember that the SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, which is a Lorentz-covariant theory. So the effective operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But does it require Poincare? Poincare includes translations as well. Well, the SM itself is Poincare invariant because it's a relativistic theory. So the SMEFT should also respect Poincare. So options 1 and 2 would be correct.

Next, what about CP symmetry? CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP-symmetric because of things like the CKM matrix in quark mixing. But the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, depending on what physics you're considering. So I think operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP, may not be a must-have symmetry.

CPT symmetry is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-symmetric. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT because they respect Lorentz.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if a theory is Lorentz symmetric, then it must also be CPT symmetric. So operators must respect CPT because they respect Lorentz. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together: Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? They are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait: Poincare symmetry is a subset of Lorentz? No, no, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators respect Poincare, they also respect Lorentz. But is the SMEFT built to respect Poincare? Well, the SM is, so the SMEFT, as an extension, should also respect Poincare, right? But wait, perhaps in the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant but not necessarily Poincare. Because when you add dimension-6 operators, like (H† H) (F F), etc., they are built to be Lorentz scalars. But do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which are about momentum. But when you have higher dimension operators, their form would have to make the theory translation-invariant, which I think they are because the SM is. Wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory, which is still a Lorentz and Poincare-invariant theory. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So operators must respect 1,2, and 4. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be correct. Because all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Option D is 1,3,4, but I thought CP isn't necessarily required. So the correct answer should be option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, which is a Lorentz-covariant theory. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, as it is a fundamental requirement for relativistic field theories.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the SMEFT is an effective theory of the Standard Model, which is Poincaré-invariant, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric due to phenomena like the CKM matrix in quark mixing. Consequently, operators in SMEFT do not necessarily need to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-symmetric. Since all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
