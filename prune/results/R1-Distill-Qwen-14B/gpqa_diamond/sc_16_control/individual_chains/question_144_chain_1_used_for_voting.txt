Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question gives me E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. Wait, mesons are bosons, right? And their decay lengths depend on their lifetimes and velocities.

I remember that the mean decay distance is given by the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, particles that are unstable decay quickly, so their lifetime is related to their decay width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle says τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Or wait, I think the relation is τ = ħ / (Γ/2π) because Γ is the total decay width, and the natural linewidth is Γ/(2π). So τ = ħ * 2π / Γ.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: the mean lifetime τ is related to the inverse of the decay width. The formula I think is τ = ħ/(Γ). Or maybe it's τ = ħ/(Γ/2π) because Γ is the total decay rate, which I think is the same as Γ = ħ/τ. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me get this straight.

In quantum mechanics, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So solving for τ, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, sometimes Γ is given as a total width, which is in energy units. The lifetime is in seconds, so using units carefully is important.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I need to find the velocity of the meson. But to find velocity, I probably need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Since the meson is produced with a certain energy E_X, but wait, is that the rest mass energy or the kinetic energy? Hmm, the problem says "production energy is E_X=8 GeV". Oh, wait, in particle physics, when they give the energy of a produced particle, it's usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, more accurately, energy is the total energy, so E = γ m c².

Wait, but the meson's rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E_X is 8 GeV. That means the meson is moving at a high speed because its total energy is much higher than its rest mass.

So to find the velocity, we can use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. The energy E is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( (E/(c²))² - m² ) * c.

Wait, let's write it correctly. Let me write E in units where c=1 for simplicity. Then E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)^(1/2). Wait, no, E squared equals p squared plus m squared (times c^4, but since we're using units where c=1, it's E² = p² + m²).

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let me calculate that: 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV/c. Wait, but in units where c=1, p is in GeV/c, but perhaps I should calculate the numerical value.

Wait, but I need the velocity. Velocity v can be found from the relation v = (pc²)/(E). Since E = gamma m c^2 and p = gamma m v. So v = (pc^2)/(E) = (gamma m v c^2) / (gamma m c^2) )= v. So that works. Wait, another way, using beta = v/c = (pc)/(E). So beta = (p c ) / (E), but since p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)/c, let's see.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write everything in SI units.

First, let me compute the momentum p. E_X is 8 GeV. m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Solving for pc:

pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ). Let's compute that.

E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So E^2 = 64 (GeV)^2, (m c²)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

So (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

But we need to convert GeV to Joules to get momentum in kg m/s.

1 GeV is approximately 1.60218e-10 J. So pc =7.91 GeV ≈ 7.91 * 1.60218e-10 J·s/m (since p has units kg m/s, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, GeV is a unit of energy, so pc is GeV·s/m? Not sure, but perhaps I should convert each value to SI.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta (v/c) using the formula beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)}.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)}.

Wait, let's compute that. m = 1.2 GeV/c², E =8 GeV. So (m c^2)^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2, E^2 = (8 GeV)^2.

So (m c^2)^2/(E^2) = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So beta is about 0.9887.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Hmm, Γ is the total decay width, which is an energy. So to find τ, the mean lifetime, I need to convert Γ into units of inverse seconds.

Wait, Γ = 320 MeV. So let's convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 5.126976e-11 J.

So Γ =5.126976e-11 J.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that:

τ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-11 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (5.126976e-11) s.

Let me compute the denominator: 5.126976e-11.

So numerator is 1.0545718e-34.

Dividing them: 1.05457e-34 /5.126976e-11 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's tau, the lifetime.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * tau.

v is beta c.

v = 0.9887 * c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So L = beta c * tau.

So let's compute that.

beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e-16 m.

2.966 * 2.056 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932, 2.966 * 0.056 ≈ 0.167. So total is about 6.099.

So 6.099e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, and D is 4.0655e-16. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 6e-16 m. That's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta.

Wait, let me recalculate beta. Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)}.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2=1.44 GeV².

E² is 64 GeV².

So 1.44/64 = 0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775.

Square root is approximately 0.9887. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So perhaps I should check units correctly.

Wait, when I calculated τ, I used Γ =320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So converting 0.32 GeV to J: 0.32 * 1e9 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 0.32e9 *1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ=1, c=1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: using natural units where ħ=1, c=1, then Γ is in GeV, and the units for lifetime τ would be in GeV^-1.

But how to convert that to meters?

Well, in natural units, 1 GeV^-1 is approximately 6.582e-25 seconds. Because ħ c ≈ 197 MeV fm, and to get time, we can use ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Wait, so τ = ħ / Γ. So in natural units, τ (in GeV^-1) is 1 / Γ (GeV).

Wait, because in natural units, Γ (GeV) is 1/τ (GeV^-1), so τ ≈ 1/(320 MeV) = 1/(0.32 GeV) ≈ 3.125 GeV^-1.

So to convert GeV^-1 to seconds, multiply by ħ in GeV s units.

Wait, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (1/Γ) * ħ → (1/(0.32 GeV)) * 6.582e-25 GeV·s) → (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s, which matches what I got before.

So no mistake there.

Then, the velocity is 0.9887 c. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.108e-16 meters.

Wait but the options are about 5e-16 or 4e-16. So I must have made a mistake. Where?

Wait, perhaps the production energy E is not the total energy but the kinetic energy? Wait, that would change things. Let me consider that possibility.

Wait, if E is the kinetic energy K, then the total energy E_total = K + m c².

Wait, but the problem states "production energy is E_X =8 GeV". Hmm, in particle physics, when a particle is produced, its energy is usually its kinetic energy plus rest mass? Or is it the total energy? I think it's the total energy, because production processes usually consider the total energy.

Well, maybe the issue is elsewhere. Let's think about the decay width. Decay width in GeV is Γ. So when calculating τ, it's ħ / Γ. But perhaps I should consider whether the width is given as the total width or the natural linewidth. Because I remember that the lifetime is τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), but sometimes in resonance experiments, the width is Γ = Γ_total/(2π), so τ = ħ/(Γ_total/(2π)) )= 2π ħ / Γ_total.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the lifetime. Let me double-check.

The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/Γ.

But wait, in some contexts, the width Γ is the total decay width, so the formula holds. So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but I used it correctly in GeV? Let's check: Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So in my calculation, I used 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the meson's velocity and lifetime, but perhaps I should consider relativistic effects. Wait, but I think I did that because I accounted for beta.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is given by (c * tau) * beta. Wait, I did. Because L = v * tau = beta c * tau.

Hmm, I'm not sure where the mistake is. Maybe I made a calculation error when computing beta.

Wait, let me compute beta again. m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

Beta = sqrt(1 - m^2 / E^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's compute the momentum p in GeV/c.

p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c. So p =7.91 GeV/c.

Now, the velocity beta is p c / E → (7.91 GeV/c * c ) /8 GeV =7.91/8 = 0.98875. Same as before.

So that's correct.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps I should use the natural unit conversion factors differently. Let's think in terms of meters.

Wait, in natural units, 1 GeV^-1 is (6.582e-25 s) multiplied by c, which is 3e8 m/s. So 1 GeV^-1 = 6.582e-25 *3e8 = 1.9746e-16 meters.

So if τ is 3.125 GeV^-1 (since 1/0.32 GeV is 3.125 GeV^-1), then the length is beta * c * tau.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think in natural units again.

In natural units, c=1, ħ=1, so tau is in GeV^-1. Then, to convert GeV^-1 to meters, since 1 GeV^-1 = ħ c / GeV = (6.582e-25 GeV s) * (3e8 m/s) / GeV ) = 6.582e-25 *3e8 m = 1.9746e-16 m.

So 1 GeV^-1 is 1.9746e-16 m.

So, tau is 3.125 GeV^-1. So tau in meters is 3.125 * 1.9746e-16 m = approx 6.1706e-16 m.

But wait, that's the same as what I got before because v is about 0.9887, but wait, I'm not considering beta here. Because in natural units, beta is p/E. So same as before, beta is 7.91 GeV/c /8 GeV = 0.98875. But in natural units, c=1, so beta is p/E.

Wait, wait, no. In natural units, all units are in terms of GeV and GeV/c².

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting me confused again. Let me try it again.

So, tau is 3.125 GeV^-1. But in meters, that's 3.125 * 1.9746e-16 m ≈ 6.17e-16 m.

But that's the same as before. But the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, etc. So 6e-16 is not an option.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Maybe I need to find beta gamma instead of just beta.

Wait, because when particles are moving at high speeds, the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Wait, no. Because the lifetime is the proper time. Or is the lifetime the same in the lab frame?

Wait, no. The lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the particle, the lifetime is longer by a factor gamma. So the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, that's a key point! Oh, I think I missed that completely. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

So L = v gamma tau.

Wait, no, wait. In the rest frame, the particle's lifetime is tau. But in the lab frame, which sees the particle moving, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So the decay distance is L = v * (gamma * tau) = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, correct. Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer by gamma, and the velocity is beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Ah, so I think this is where I went wrong earlier. I forgot to account for the time dilation factor gamma. So I need to calculate gamma and multiply it by beta c and tau.

So let's compute gamma.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... ≈6.6667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Now, recomputing L.

L = beta c * gamma tau.

Beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056e-24 seconds.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056e-24 s.

Let me compute each part.

First, beta c = 0.9887 *3e8 ≈2.966e8 m/s.

gamma tau =6.6667 *2.056e-24 ≈1.37e-23 s.

Multiply them: 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37e-23 s = (2.966 *1.37) *1e-15 m.

2.966 *1.37 ≈ 4.068.

So L ≈4.068e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15.

So 4.068e-15 is close to option B (4.0655e-15), which would be the correct answer.

Wait, so that's option B.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I forgot to multiply by gamma, which accounts for time dilation. That's a crucial factor. The mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime in the lab frame, which is longer than the proper lifetime by gamma. Hence, the decay length is longer than what I originally calculated.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta c \cdot \gamma \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \beta \)
The total energy of the particle is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its rest mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2 c^4}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \cdot \gamma \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (2.056 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta c \):

\[
\beta c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Next, calculate \( \gamma \tau \):

\[
\gamma \tau \approx 6.6667 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L \approx (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.068 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.068 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
