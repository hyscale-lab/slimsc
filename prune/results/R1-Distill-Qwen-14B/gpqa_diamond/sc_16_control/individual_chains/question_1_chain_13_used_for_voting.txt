Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their distinguishability. Hmm, the question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve these two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula is ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the lower the uncertainty, and vice versa. But wait, in this problem, we have two different lifetimes. How does that affect the energy resolution?

I think when we want to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be distinguishable due to the uncertainties overlapping.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. Oh, right! Because each state has its own lifetime, each has a certain energy uncertainty. So, to resolve E1 and E2, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Let me think. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So for state 1 with Δt1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9). For state 2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8). Comparing these, state 1 has a larger ΔE because a shorter lifetime means larger uncertainty.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be bigger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Since ΔE1 is larger, the difference should be bigger than ΔE1. Because if the energy difference is smaller than ΔE1, you can't tell them apart, because E1's energy could have a spread that overlaps with E2.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the uncertainty is about the energy measurement. So, if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then they are resolvable. Because if energies are close, the uncertainties might allow their ranges to overlap. So the condition is ΔE (difference) > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps the larger of the two, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think the principle is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty, which for each state is based on their respective lifetimes. But if the two states have different lifetimes, their uncertainties are different. So to resolve the two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the uncertainty in the energy measurements.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to calculate the uncertainty in the energy for each state and find the minimum energy difference required for them not to overlap. So, if the energy difference is greater than the sum of the uncertainties, you can differentiate them. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum, their energy ranges could overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference just needs to be greater than the uncertainty of the system as a whole. But I'm not sure. Let me recheck the theory.

Wait, here's a thought. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, and Δt is the lifetime (time over which the energy is measured). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2Δt_i).

The energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states for them to be resolvable. Because if it's not, the energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell which state you're in.

So let's compute the uncertainties.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

I know that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So, ħ in eV·s is approximately 4.3e-18 eV·s.

Wait, let me compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. Convert that to eV·s:

1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV, so ħ ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.055e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV·s.

Calculate that: 1.055e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.59e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE_i = ħ/(2Δt_i)

For state 1: Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (6.59e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.59e-16) / (2e-9) eV.

Calculate denominator 2e-9 = 2 * 1e-9.

So 6.59e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.59/2) * 1e-7 = 3.295e-7 eV.

So about 3.3e-7 eV.

State 2: Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (6.59e-16) / (2e-8) = (6.59 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.295e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.3e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.3e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.3e-7 + 3.3e-8 = 3.63e-7 eV.

But wait, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the larger uncertainty. Because for the states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, you can't distinguish. Let me think again.

Wait, no, actually, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. So, for E1 and E2 to be distinguishable, |E2 - E1| must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Because if the difference is less than that sum, the energy levels' uncertainties would overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So let's compute the sum of the two uncertainties.

ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.3e-7 eV + 3.3e-8 eV = 3.63e-7 eV.

So our energy difference must be greater than 3.63e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than 3.63e-7. Because 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, so 1e-4 is way bigger than 3.63e-7.

Wait, 3.63e-7 is 0.363e-6, which is 363e-9. 1e-4 is 100,000e-9. So yes, 1e-4 eV is much larger than 3.63e-7 eV. So option C would satisfy the condition.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → which is 0.01e-6. That's 1e-8, but 3.63e-7 is about 36 times larger, so D is too small.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \times \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For each state, the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_i}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties
The reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \) in units of \( \text{eV} \cdot \text{s} \) is approximately \( 6.59 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV} \cdot \text{s} \).

- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.295 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.295 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.295 \times 10^{-7} + 3.295 \times 10^{-8} = 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must exceed \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 100,000 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be greater than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), and the only option that satisfies this condition is **Option C**.
