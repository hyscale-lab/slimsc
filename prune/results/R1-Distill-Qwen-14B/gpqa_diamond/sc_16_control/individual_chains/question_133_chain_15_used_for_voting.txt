Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are provided as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.

Hmm, so the key here is to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. I think I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH of the solution. The various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The Ka values determine the predominant form at a given pH.

First, I need to figure out the pH of the solution because that will determine which phosphate species are present. But wait, the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Do I need to consider their buffer capacity? Oh right, KH2PO4 is a weak acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and Na2HPO4 is a weak base (it can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-). So this mixture should form a buffer solution. 

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might be applicable here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the salts. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. Na2HPO4●2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water, but since it's dihydrated, the water is part of the crystal structure but will dissolve, so it shouldn't affect the solution much beyond providing HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The ratio of their concentrations will determine the pH via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But first, I need to calculate the concentrations of each of these salts in the solution. Let's start by finding the number of moles of each.

For KH2PO4:
Mass = 1.00 g
Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol
Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Mass = 1.00 g
Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol
Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So each mole of this compound gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- will be from KH2PO4, and HPO4^2- will be from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

But wait, the solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007334 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005614 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02807 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Which pKa should I use here? Since H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.02807 / 0.03667)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.02807 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

The log of 0.766 is approximately log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of the ratio.

0.02807 / 0.03667 = let's see, 0.02807 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766. Yes, correct.

Log(0.766) is about log(0.766). Let me calculate it more accurately. Since 10^0.88 is about 7.66, but wait, wait no, that's for 10^0.88 being 7.66. Wait, no, 10^0 is 1, 10^0.7 is about 5, 10^0.8 is about 6.3, 10^-0.11 is 0.775, so log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.094.

Wait, but wait. The solution's pH is about 7.09, which is slightly basic. But wait, the phosphate buffer system can have a pH around that area.

Now, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. But wait, in solution, PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- accepting a proton, but that's the third dissociation step.

Wait, but wait. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the pKa3 is about 11.74.

But wait, the pH of the solution is around 7.09, which is below the pKa3. So in this solution, the HPO4^2- will predominantly stay as HPO4^2- rather than dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait. The solution's pH is around 7.1, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74). So the HPO4^2- will not deprotonate much. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, determined by the third dissociation.

But how to compute it?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all equilibria. But maybe since the pH is below pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- is minimal, and can be approximated using the third dissociation.

So, for HPO4^2- in solution, the equilibrium is:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

But wait, we can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be found from the pH, which is 7.09. So [H+] ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ approximately 8.23e-8 M.

Let me compute that:

[H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.23e-8)

Wait, but wait. The [HPO4^2-] I have is 0.02807 M. So plugging in:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) = 5.05e-14

Divided by 8.23e-8: 5.05e-14 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 6.138e-7 M.

Wait, but that's about 6.14e-7 M. Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the pH.

Wait, let me recheck the pH calculation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which is pKa2 = 7.208, and the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02807 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766, which is about 0.766. So log(0.766) is approximately -0.114. So pH = 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another thing: when calculating [PO4^3-], perhaps I should take into account that some of the HPO4^2- might deprotonate, but given pH is much lower than pKa3, the contribution is negligible, so the approximation should hold.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.23e-8) ≈ 6.138e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, but my calculation is about 6.14e-7. Close, but not exact. Maybe I made an error in the moles or the initial concentrations.

Let me double-check the moles.

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007334 mol. Correct.

For Na2HPO4●2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol. Correct.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03667 M, and HPO4^2- is 0.02807 M.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the pH calculation. Let me compute the exact ratio.

Ratio = 0.005614 / 0.007334 = 0.005614 / 0.007334 ≈ 0.766. So log(0.766) is what?

Using a calculator: log(0.766) is about -0.114. So pH is 7.208-0.114=7.094.

So [H+] is 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, but let me compute Ka3: 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.23e-8) = (5.05e-14) /8.23e-8 ≈ 6.138e-7 M.

Hmm. Now, looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to my calculation.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phosphate species. Because the question asks for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. But wait, in the buffer solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- is a minor species because it's the third dissociation.

Wait, but wait, perhaps another approach is to consider all the possible phosphate species and see their concentrations.

The total concentration of phosphate comes from all forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-. But in aqueous solution, especially in the presence of the salts, H3PO4 is negligible because the pH is around 7, and H3PO4 is a stronger acid, so it's not present much. Similarly, PO4^3- is minimal.

Wait, but maybe I can calculate the exact [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation.

So, the third dissociation is:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] as 0.02807 M, and [H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8.23e-8

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0526e-14 /8.23e-8 = 6.14e-7.

So approximately 6.14e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7 M. But in the options, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not as straightforward because the HPO4^2- can also come from the dissociation of H2PO4^-. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the buffer equation was supposed to use the pKa2, but the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], which is correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the orthophosphate ion concentration comes from both the direct dissociation of H3PO4, but in reality, in this solution, the main source is the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- from the salts, and the PO4^3- comes only from HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution doesn't account for the fact that some of the HPO4^2- comes from the initial dissolution of the salts, but perhaps I've already accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total phosphate concentration and use the Ka values to find the distribution.

The total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species: [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. But in this case, the solution is prepared from the salts, which contribute [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], but I should also consider that H2PO4^- can dissociate further, and HPO4^2- can dissociate further.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations I calculated are only the contributions from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, but in reality, the solution will have all the species depending on pH.

But that's a more complex calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is correct, and the orthophosphate concentration is approximately 6.14e-7, which would make option A the closest.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of what I got. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me recheck the calculation of [PO4^3-].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M
[H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.23e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0526e-14 / 8.23e-8 = 6.14e-7 M.

Hmm, same result as before.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps in the problem, the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, and when I computed the concentrations, I divided by 0.2 L.

Let me confirm:

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007334 mol. Concentration: 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M. Correct.

Na2HPO4: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005614 mol. Concentration: 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M. Correct.

So all the steps are correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when calculating the pH, I should use more precise values. Let me compute the pH more accurately.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = let me compute it more accurately.

6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8.

Log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio is 0.02807 / 0.03667 = 0.76628.

Log(0.76628) is approximately -0.1136.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1136 = 7.094.

So [H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8.23e-8 = 6.14e-7 M.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the solution is prepared with these two salts, but the actual concentrations are different due to activities or something else? Or perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the buffer equation. Wait, the buffer equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). The acid is H2PO4^- (because it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2- (because it can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-). So the equation is correct.

So given all that, I think my calculation is correct, and the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would yield a different result, but I can't see where I might have gone wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach could be to consider the exact equilibrium expressions, but I think that's more complicated and unnecessary because the pH is well below pKa3, so the PO4^3- concentration is determined by the third dissociation.

Wait, let me think about the stoichiometry once more. Maybe I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me compute the exact moles.

KH2PO4: Mw 136.09 g/mol, 1.00g → 1.00 /136.09 = 0.007334 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw 177.99 g/mol → 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005614 mol.

Yes, correct.

So, perhaps the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, with molar masses of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L). The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are provided as Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻**:  
  Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007334 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007334}{0.200} \approx 0.03667 \, \text{M} \)

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻**:  
  Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005614}{0.200} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M} \)

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the relevant pKa being pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) = -log(6.2 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.208.  
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02807}{0.03667}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.208 - 0.114 \approx 7.094
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation equilibrium
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]
The equilibrium constant is Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹², and the expression is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
The [H⁺] is calculated from the pH:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{(8.23 \times 10^{-8})}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

**Answer: A**
