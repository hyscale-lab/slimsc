Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges distribute themselves in certain ways, especially in electrostatic conditions.

Alright, the problem says we've got an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small cavity inside it, radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, so the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. That's an important point. Then a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. And l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, okay, so I need to visualize this setup.

I remember that for conductors, charges reside on the surface. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, any internal charges would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but wait, the conductor was uncharged, and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So, the conductor being neutral before, when +q is placed inside, it must induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges must move to the surfaces.

So, the inner surface of the conductor (the part near the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the +q inside the cavity attracts the electrons in the conductor to its inner surface, leaving the outer part of the conductor with a charge of +q. Because the conductor was originally neutral, the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the net charge on the conductor is zero. Placing +q inside the cavity would induce -q on the inner surface, so the outer surface must have +q to balance, right? Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so outer surface charge is +q.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The conductor is neutral. The cavity is inside, and when you place a charge inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge opposite to it. So yes, inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q. Because the net charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So -q (inner) + outer = 0, so outer must be +q.

But wait, the conductor is conducting, so the charges can move freely. The presence of the +q inside the cavity will cause the electrons in the conductor to move towards the cavity's inner surface, leaving the outer surface with a positive charge.

So, when you're outside the conductor, the electric field you experience is due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface you're considering. So, the Gaussian surface here would be a sphere of radius L (since point P is at L from the conductor's center). The charges inside this Gaussian surface would be the +q on the outer surface. But wait, the +q is on the outer surface, so the Gaussian surface includes all of that charge. So, by Gauss's Law, the electric field would be as if all the charge is concentrated at the center, because of the spherical symmetry.

Wait, but the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. So, does that affect the symmetry? Because the cavity is off-center, but the conductor is a sphere, so in terms of the electric field outside the conductor, the induced charges might still result in a symmetrical field. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface would distribute uniformly, regardless of the cavity's position. So, from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all its charge is at the center. So the electric field at P would be the same as if the +q was at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but what about the point P's position relative to the cavity's center? The problem states that l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and the angle theta is between l and s (the distance between the two centers). So, the position of P is not along the same line as s. How does that factor into the electric field calculation?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Because when considering the field outside the conductor, the conductor's induced charges create a field that's uniform as if all the charge were at the center. So regardless of where P is located, as long as it's outside, the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. So the +q on the outer surface induces a field as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a Gaussian surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by epsilon_0. So, the field at point P would be as if all the charge is at the center. So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because the distance from the center is L.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. Option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems correct.

But wait, wait a second. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside is due to the +q on the outer surface. So yeah, the field is as if the charge were at the center, so E is proportional to 1/L².

What about the position of the cavity? If the cavity isn't centered, does that affect the external field? Because from outside, the conductor's external surface is a sphere, so the field should be the same as a point charge at the center, irrespective of the internal arrangement. Because the conductor shields the exterior from the internal fields except for the induced charges.

So, the presence of the cavity off-center doesn't change the external field. The field outside is determined by the net charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (due to the attraction of electrons in the conductor). To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor develops a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface of radius $L$ (the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$). Since the conductor is spherical and the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Effect of the Cavity's Position**: The cavity is not centered within the conductor, but this does not affect the external electric field. The field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge on the outer surface and the spherical symmetry of the conductor. The internal arrangement of charges, including the position of the cavity, does not influence the external field.

4. **Gauss's Law**: Using Gauss's Law, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula does not account for the correct distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point $P$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The distance $l$ and angle $\theta$ are irrelevant for the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the formula resembles Gauss's Law, it incorrectly uses $l$ instead of $L$.

Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
