Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis here. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So I guess the wave function must be zero outside of that region, but isn't that already the case here?

Wait, no. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that can't be right because when we square the absolute value of the wave function, we should get the probability density. But wait, the wave function includes an imaginary part, which is -0.5i. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the expression. Let me read it again.

Oh, wait, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function where the real part is a / sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually expressed as functions of x, but in this case, the imaginary part is a constant, not dependent on x. That's unusual. Because if the imaginary part is a constant, then the wave function's phase is uniform across all x, which would make the probability density (which is |psi|^2) the same everywhere, except for the 1/sqrt(1+x) term.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the probability density would be |psi|^2, which is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So the probability density depends on x as 1/(1+x). But the measurements say that all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. But in the given expression, the wave function is non-zero everywhere, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the wave function.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is only valid in the region x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because if all measurements are between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But the expression (a / sqrt(1 + x)) -0.5i is given as the wave function in the part where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside of this region. Then, perhaps the wave function as given is valid for x between 1 and 3.

But wait, to find the normalization constant 'a', I need to integrate the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1, since the total probability must be 1.

But wait, the wave function as given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) -0.5i. So let's compute |psi(x)|². That would be (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, right? Because the square of a complex number a + b i is a² + b², but wait no, that's not correct. Wait, the absolute value squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So yes.

So |psi(x)|² = [a²/(1 + x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that's not correct because if the wavefunction is a + b i, then |psi|^2 is (a)^2 + (b)^2. So in this case, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and b is (-0.5). So |psi|^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But then, the integral of |psi|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1, because the total probability is 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, break it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3.

Compute the first integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So that's a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding them together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7206.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7206) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function as given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So is this a valid wave function? Because the imaginary part is a constant, not depending on x. That's a bit odd because, typically, the wave function can have both real and imaginary parts varying with x, but in this case, the imaginary part is a constant. But regardless, the probability density would still be correctly computed as the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts.

Wait, but if the wave function is given as that expression, then it's a valid function as long as it's normalized and meets boundary conditions. But perhaps I should double-check whether that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

The integral of |psi|^2 from 1 to3 is [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

Wait, no, because [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 is a²/(1+x), and (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So yes, that's correct.

So the first integral is a² * integral(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3, which is a² * ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So adding, a² ln(2) +0.5 =1 → a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²= 0.5/ln(2) ≈ 0.5/0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability must integrate to 1 over this interval:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

   \[
   a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7206 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7206} \approx 0.849
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
