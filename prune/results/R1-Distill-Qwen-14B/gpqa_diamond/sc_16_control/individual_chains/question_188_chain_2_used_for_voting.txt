Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal structure has all edges equal and all angles equal, but wait, no, wait—actually, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral, or trigonal, systems have a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ equal, right? Or wait, no, maybe in some cases the angles aren't all equal. Or is that the case for the cubic system? No, wait, in the rhombohedral system, the three edges are equal—so a = b = c—but the angles can vary. Wait, but in this problem, the angles are all 30 degrees. So the crystal is a rhombohedral structure with a = b = c, and each angle α, β, γ is 30 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices. The formula I think is d = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cosα) + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ)) ), but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, I think in the case of a rhombohedral system, the formula might simplify because a = b = c and α = β = γ.

Let me think. Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ between the axes is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos(γ)/ (a b) - 2hl cos(β)/(a c) - 2kl cos(α)/(b c)

But in the case where a = b = c, this becomes more manageable. So let's substitute a = b = c = a. And since α = β = γ = 30 degrees, cos(30) is √3/2, approximately 0.866.

So plugging in, the equation for 1/d² becomes:

h² + k² + l²
divided by a squared, minus 2hk cos(30)/ (a^2) - 2hl cos(30)/(a^2) - 2kl cos(30)/(a^2)

Wait, because each denominator term a*b would be a^2 when a=b=c.

So factor out 1/(a²):

1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(30) - 2hl cos(30) - 2kl cos(30) ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosα - 2kl cosα )

Wait, because cosα is the same for all angles since α=β=γ=30. So, the formula simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) )

In this problem, the Miller indices are (111), so h = k = l = 1.

Substituting these values:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) - 2*(√3/2) * (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) )

Because cos(30) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

Let me compute the numerator and the denominator step by step.

Numerator: a = 10 Angstrom.

Denominator: sqrt( 3 - 2*(√3/2)*(3) )

Wait, because h² + k² + l² is 1+1+1=3.

The term -2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) becomes -2*(√3/2) * (3), since hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3.

So let's compute that:

The expression inside the sqrt is 3 - [2*(√3/2)*3 ]

Simplify the second term: 2*(√3/2) is √3. Multiply by 3, so it's 3√3.

So the expression inside the sqrt is 3 - 3√3.

Wait, that can't be right because 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3 - 5.196 is negative. Oh wait, that can't be correct because the denominator would be sqrt of a negative number, which is not possible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me double-check the formula for 1/d². Oh wait, perhaps I got the signs wrong. Because in the formula it's -2hk cos α, etc. So when I compute the denominator, it's 3 - 2*(√3/2)*3, but wait, wait, no.

Wait, the term is (h² + k² + l²) minus 2 hk cos α minus 2 hl cos β minus 2 kl cos gamma. Since all angles are 30 degrees and cos 30 is the same, it's 3 terms of -2 * cos(30) * (each product).

So, it's 3 - 2*(√3/2)(1 +1 +1). Because hk =1, hl=1, kl=1, each multiplied by cosα, and summed.

Wait, no, the sum is hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3.

So the denominator becomes 3 - 2*(√3/2)*3.

So 2*(√3/2) is √3, multiplied by 3 gives 3√3.

So denominator is 3 - 3√3. Wait, 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 is about -2.196, which is negative. That can't be possible because the denominator under the square root can't be negative. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the inverse formula.

Wait, the formula I'm remembering is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )). Wait, but in this case, a is the lattice parameter, which is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but wait—if α, β, gamma are the angles between the axes, then in a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the a-axis and b-axis (alpha), a and c (beta?), or some other combination. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system with a = b = c, and angles alpha between a and b, beta between a and c, and gamma between b and c.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles α, β, γ are all the same, right? Because it's a special case of the triclinic system where a = b = c and angles are all equal. So in that case, cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma = cos(30 degrees) = √3/2.

So substituting into the formula, the denominator becomes:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos alpha - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma.

Which is:

h² + k² + l² - 2 cos alpha ( hk + hl + kl )

Because cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So substituting:

3 - 2*(√3/2)*(3) = 3 - (√3)*3.

Because 2*(√3/2) is √3. Then multiplied by 3, that's 3√3.

So 3 - 3√3 is approximately 3 -5.196= -2.196, which is negative. That can't be, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the angles. Because in the rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are 60 degrees, but wait, no, the problem says 30 degrees. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be written in terms of the unit cell vectors.

The unit vectors are along a, b, c, each of length a, and the angles between them are alpha, beta, gamma.

The formula for the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

But wait, no, that's 1/d squared equals that expression divided by (a^2). So, the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/a² + l²/a² - 2 hk cos alpha / a² - 2 hl cos beta /a² - 2 kl cos gamma / a² )

Which can be written as:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

Now, substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

Denominator inside the square root:

1 +1 +1 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30

Which is:

3 - 2*(√3/2) - 2*(√3/2) - 2*(√3/2)

Simplify:

3 - 2*(√3/2)*3 → 3 - 3√3.

Wait, because each of the three terms is 2*(1*1)*cos30, so three times that.

So 3√3 is approximately 5.196, so 3 -5.196 is negative, which can't be. So this must mean that I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, no, that would make the denominator larger, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the sign wrong in the formula. Let me check another source. Oh wait, I'm trying to think from what I remember. Let me think again.

Wait, in the case of a cubic system where alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, cos(alpha) etc are zero. So the denominator becomes sqrt(3), so d = a/√3 for (111) plane.

Which makes sense because in cubic, the interplanar distance for (111) is a√3/3 = a/(√3).

But in our case, with angles 30 degrees, but the same a.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Hmm, perhaps another approach. Wait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the volume of the unit cell is a³ multiplied by the square root of 1 + 2 cos alpha + 2 cos beta + 2 cos gamma + 2 cos(alpha + beta) + cos(alpha + beta + gamma), but that's probably not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar spacing in terms of the lattice parameter and the angles.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But wait, no, that can't be right because for cubic, theta is 90 degrees, so cos(theta)=0, and denominator is sqrt(3), which is correct.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused between the angles in the formula. Let me think again. The general formula for d is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos(alpha) + 2 hl cos(beta) + 2 kl cos(gamma) )

Wait, but in that case, for cubic, cos(alpha)=0, so denominator is sqrt(3), which is correct.

But in our case, we have alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, so cos(alpha)=√3/2.

So substituting h=k=l=1:

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(1)(1)*√3/2 *3 )

Wait, because each term 2hk cos(alpha) is 2*1*1*(√3/2) = sqrt(3), and there are three such terms: hk, hl, and kl.

So,

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, that makes more sense because then the denominator is a positive number.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Then,

a is 10 Angstrom.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Simplify the denominator:

3 +3√3 = 3(1 +√3 )

So sqrt(3(1+√3)) ) is sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 +√3 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, compute the value numerically.

Compute 3 +3√3:

√3 ≈ 1.732, so 3√3 ≈5.196. So 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.864.

So d ≈10 /2.864 ≈3.492. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are around 8-10 angstrom.

Wait, that's a problem. Because all the options are in the 8-10 range, but my calculation gives around 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the inverse formula. Because I might have mixed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2 hl cos(beta) + 2 kl cos(gamma) )

Wait, that would make the denominator larger than 3, leading to a smaller d. But wait, in our case, that would make the denominator sqrt(3 + 2*(√3/2)*3 )= sqrt(3 +3√3) as before, which is the same as before.

Wait, but that leads to the same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d =  a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2( hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos(gamma) ) )

But that brings us back to the earlier problem of the denominator being sqrt(3 - 3√3), which is negative, which is impossible.

So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I should recall that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since all angles are equal to 30 degrees, theta=30 degrees.

Wait, but wait, in that case, substituting h=k=l=1:

denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3) cos(30)).

Which is 3 - 6*(√3/2)= 3-3√3 ≈3-5.196= -2.196. Hmm, which again is negative.

So that can't be right. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the angles in the formula. Let me try looking it up in my mind.

Another approach: the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos(theta) )

where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. But in this case, theta is 30 degrees.

So, with h=k=l=1, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*cos(30)).

Which is sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ sqrt(3 +5.196) ≈ sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So, d=10 /2.864≈3.492 Angstrom, which still doesn't match any option.

Wait, but the options are in the 8-10 range, so perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the formula uses the reciprocal?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + ... )

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the volume approach. The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V= a^3 * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α + 2 cos β + 2 cos γ + 2 cos(α + β) + cos(α + β + γ)) )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach: The reciprocal of the interplanar distance (1/d) is given by the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the Miller indices to find the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, for a general crystal system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h = (h/a) e1 + (k/(a sin α)) e2 + (l/(a sin α sin β)) e3

But this is getting complicated, perhaps I should think of another way.

Wait, maybe I should compute the structure factor or use the relation between the planes.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for d-spacing in terms of the volume of the unit cell and the Miller indices.

Wait, the volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma + ... )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the metric tensor.

In crystallography, the metric tensor g is used to relate the reciprocal lattice vectors. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g = [ [a², a² cos α, a² cos β ],
       [a² cos α, a², a² cos gamma ],
       [a² cos beta, a² cos gamma, a² ] ]

Wait, but in our case, a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

g11 = a²
g12 = a² cos 30
g13 = a² cos 30
g22 = a²
g23 = a² cos 30
g33 = a²

So, the matrix is symmetric with all off-diagonal terms equal to a² cos30.

Now, the reciprocal lattice vectors (hkl) are given by the solution to the equation:

h g11 + k g12 + l g13 = 1/d²

Wait, not exactly. The reciprocal lattice vector components (h, k, l) satisfy:

h^2 g11 + k^2 g22 + l^2 g33 + 2hk g12 + 2hl g13 + 2kl g23 = 1/d²

Wait, perhaps. Alternatively, using the metric tensor, the interplanar distance d is given by:

1/d² = h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2hk g12 + 2hl g13 + 2kl g23.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around: the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector is sqrt( h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2hk g12 + 2hl g13 + 2kl g23 ), and 1/d is this magnitude.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

1/d² = h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2hk g12 + 2hl g13 + 2 kl g23.

So, substituting the values:

g11 = a² = (10)^2 = 100 (A²)

g12 = g13 = g23 = a² cos(30) ≈ 100 * 0.8660 ≈86.60.

So, for (111):

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Compute each term:

h² g11 = 1 * 100 =100.

k² g22 =1 *100=100.

l² g33=1*100=100.

2hk g12=2*1*1*86.60= 173.2

2hl g13=2*1*1*86.60=173.2.

2kl g23=2*1*1*86.60=173.2.

Adding all these:

100 +100 +100 =300.

173.2 *3=519.6.

So total sum is 300 +519.6 =819.6.

So,

1/d² =819.6 → d²=1/819.6 → d= sqrt(1/819.6) ≈ 0.03499 Angstroms.

Wait, that can't be right because the interplanar distance is supposed to be on the order of 8-10 Angstroms, not 0.03 Angstroms.

Wait, but I'm getting d≈0.035 Angstrom, which is way off the given options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the reciprocal of the formula correctly. Let me think. Because 1/d² = sum of terms, so d=1/sqrt(sum). So sum is 819.6, so 1/d²=819.6 → d²=1/819.6 → d≈0.03499 Ang.

But this can't be right because the interplanar distance should be similar to the lattice parameter, but perhaps I messed up the metric tensor approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different formula.

Wait, wait, I think I forgot that the metric tensor is in terms of a, which is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but it's giving a very small d. Since the options are much larger, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be 1/d² = (h² a² + k² a² + l² a² + ... )? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Because the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined in terms of the metric tensor.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h g11 + k g12 + l g13 )^2 + ... similar terms, but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

But earlier, that gave a negative denominator. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

where theta is the angle between the vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees.

So, substituting h=k=l=1,

denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos(30)).

Which is sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈ sqrt(8.196) ≈2.864.

So, d =10 / 2.864 ≈3.492 Angstrom, which again is way off the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Another idea: in a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles alpha=beta=gamma=θ, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But when θ=60 degrees, this would give d = a/√3 for (111), which is correct. But in our case, θ=30 degrees, so let's try that again.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*cos30 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 -6*(√3/2)) = 10 / sqrt(3 -3√3 )

Which is sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So this can't be the right formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal of the projection onto the plane.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of other options. Maybe I should use the relation between the Miller indices and the plane distances without directly plugging in the formula. Let's think about the geometry.

In a rhombohedral system, each unit cell is a rhombohedron—a three-dimensional figure with all edges equal and all angles equal. The (111) plane would cut each axis once.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I can model the situation as a cube with each face now a rhombus. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a=10 Angstrom and angles 30 degrees.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can imagine the (111) plane in this structure. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent (111) planes.

Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal lattice vector and find its magnitude.

In reciprocal space, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl)=(111) is given by:

G = (1/a) [ h e1 + k e2 + l e3 ]

But wait, in real space, the unit vectors e1, e2, e3 are not orthogonal. So the magnitude of G is reciprocal to the interplanar distance d.

So |G| = 1/d.

So, to compute |G|, we can write it as:

|G|² = (h/a e1 + k/a e2 + l/a e3) · (h/a e1 + k/a e2 + l/a e3 )

Which expands to:

(h²/a²) |e1|² + (k²/a²)|e2|² + (l²/a²)|e3|² + 2(hk/a²)(e1·e2) + 2(hl/a²)(e1·e3) + 2(kl/a²)(e2·e3)

Since e1, e2, e3 are unit vectors but not orthogonal, their dot products are cos of the angles between them. So,

e1·e2 = cos alpha = cos30 = √3/2,

e1·e3 = cos beta = √3/2,

e2·e3 = cos gamma = √3/2.

So,

|G|² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2(hk + hl + kl) (cos30)/a².

So,

|G|² = [h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 ] / a²

Thus,

d = 1/|G| → d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 )

Substituting h=k=l=1,

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*√3/2 )

Simplify:

3 + 3√3 → because 2*(3)*(√3/2) =3√3.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

Compute denominator numerically:

3 +3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So,

d=10 / 2.864 ≈3.492 Angstrom.

Wait, but the options are around 8-10 Angstrom. So I must be making a mistake because this approach isn't aligning with the given options.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering a, the interatomic distance, but in the formula, a is the lattice parameter. Wait, but the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but according to this calculation, the interplanar distance is about 3.49 Angstrom, which is not among the options. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Alternative approach: maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )

But that would be the case for a cubic system with angles 90 degrees. So for (111), d= a/√3 =10/1.732≈5.77 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck here. Let me look for another approach. Maybe I should use the relation between the indices and the plane distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

where theta is the angle between the vectors.

So, with a=10, theta=30, h=k=l=1.

Then,

denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(3)*(√3/2) =3 +3√3≈8.196.

So,

d=10/√8.196≈10/2.864≈3.492 Angstrom.

Again, not matching the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But with theta being 60 degrees? Because in rhombohedral systems, sometimes the angles are 60 degrees.

Wait, but the problem states the angles are 30 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the face-centered cubic (FCC) or body-centered cubic (BCC) structures, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me think of the reciprocal space. The reciprocal lattice for a rhombohedral system is also rhombohedral, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula and the correct expression is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos(theta) + 2 hl cos(theta) + 2 kl cos(theta) )

Which, for theta=30 degrees, gives:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3) → same as before, 3.49 Angstrom.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a rhombohedral but a hexagonal close-packed structure, but the question says it's a rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula. Let me think again. I've found that in some sources, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that gives me the same result as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos(alpha) + 2 hl cos(beta) + 2 kl cos gamma )

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 3*(√3/2)*2 )

Wait, no, that would be 3 + 2*(3)*(√3/2) → 3 + 3√3, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula is actually:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But with theta=60 degrees, because sometimes rhombohedral systems have angles of 60 degrees.

Wait, if theta=60 degrees, then cos(theta)=0.5.

So,

Denominator: 3 -2*(3)*0.5=3-3=0 → division by zero, which is impossible.

Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe I should think that the angle between the lattice vectors is 60 degrees. But the problem states 30 degrees.

At this point, I'm stuck. Since the calculation I've done so far doesn't match any of the options, perhaps I should re-examine the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the formula for a face-centered cubic or something else, but no, the problem is about rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / (something).

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think of possible alternative approaches.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system with all angles 30 degrees, the unit cell might be a cube under a certain transformation. But perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator and see.

Wait, if d is 8.95 Angstrom, which is option B, then 1/d is about 0.1116.

So, 1/d² is about 0.01245.

So, 1/d² = 0.01245 = ?

But according to the formula, 1/d² = [3 + 3√3 ] / (10^2) → [3 +5.196]/100=8.196/100=0.08196.

Which is much larger than 0.01245, so that can't be.

Wait, but according to the metric tensor approach, 1/d² =819.6, which is way larger than 0.01245. So perhaps I'm getting confused between d and 1/d somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula and the correct calculation for 1/d² is 8.196, which would mean d=√(1/8.196) ≈ 0.349 Angstrom. Which is way off.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d² as (h² +k² +l² - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma ) /a².

In which case, with 3 -3√3 as the numerator, but that's negative, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula has a negative sign that I missed.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But in that case, when theta is 60 degrees, for (111), it would give:

denominator: 3 - 3*(0.5)*3=3-4.5= -1.5 → negative, impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found by considering the projection along the plane normal.

The (111) plane has a normal vector n = (1,1,1) in terms of the Miller indices. The magnitude of this vector in real space must be calculated, and then the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude divided by the lattice parameter.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / |n|

where |n| is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, but that's probably not correct. Let me think.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is given by:

G = (h e1 + k e2 + l e3) / (a^2 sqrt( ... )) )

But I'm not getting anywhere with that.

At this point, I'm stuck and perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I should compute the volume of the unit cell and use that to find d.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 2 cos α cos β cos γ + cos^2 α + cos^2 β + cos^2 γ )

Wait, but with all angles 30 degrees, cos α=cos β=cos γ=√3/2.

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 2*(√3/2)^3 + 3*(√3/2)^2 )

Compute each term:

(√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈0.6495.

2*(√3/2)^3= 2*(3√3/8)= (3√3)/4 ≈1.299.

(√3/2)^2=3/4=0.75.

So,

1 - 1.299 + 3*0.75 = 1 -1.299 +2.25 =1 + ( -1.299 +2.25 )=1 +0.951=1.951.

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1.951) ≈ a^3 *1.397.

With a=10, V≈1000 *1.397=1397 A^3.

But how does that help with finding the interplanar distance for (111)?

The relation between d and the volume is given by the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )) )

Wait, but I'm back to the same problem.

At this point, I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should consider that the correct approach leads to an option not matching any of the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( ... ) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(60) )

Wait, with cos(60)=0.5.

So,

denominator: 3 - 2*(3)*0.5=3-3=0 → division by zero. Not possible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2( hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos gamma ) )

Which for (111):

d=10/sqrt(3 + 3*(√3/2)*2 )

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) is given by a/(sqrt(3)) when angles are 60 degrees, but in this case, angles are 30.

Wait, but 30 degrees would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 9.08 Angstrom.

Wait, how would that happen? Let me compute 10 / sqrt( (3) + something )

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. 10/1.732≈5.7735, which is not 9.08.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct denominator is 10/sqrt(1.111) → 10/1.054=9.49, which is close to option C)9.54.

But why would the denominator be 1.111?

Wait, perhaps the correct denominator is sqrt( (3) + 2*(3)*cos(60) )

Which would be sqrt(3 +3*0.5)=sqrt(4.5)=2.121.

So, d=10/2.121≈4.714. Not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

With theta =60 degrees.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 3*0.5) → sqrt(4.5)=2.121 → d≈4.714.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But with theta =60 degrees.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3 + 3*0.5) → sqrt(4.5)=2.1213 → d≈4.714 Angstrom.

But that's not an option either.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Earlier, when I calculated using the formula with cos(30) in the denominator, I got a value around 3.49 Angstrom, which is not among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would have:

3 - 3*√3 → denominator sqrt(3 -3√3) which is imaginary. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which gives d=10/sqrt(3 +3√3)= 10/(sqrt(8.196))=10/2.864≈3.49.

But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a rhombohedral but a hexagonal system, but the question states it's rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But with theta=60 degrees.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3 +3*0.5)=10/sqrt(4.5)=10/2.1213≈4.714, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) * something.

Wait, another approach: considering that in a cubic system with a=10, (111) plane is d=10/√3≈5.7735.

But in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees, which would cause the interplanar distance to be larger than cubic, because the planes are more spread out.

Wait, because with smaller angles, the distance between planes would be larger. So, if the interplanar distance for (111) in cubic is about 5.77, then with angles 30 degrees, perhaps it's larger, around 9-10 Angstrom.

So, perhaps the correct calculation should give a larger d.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, using the formula with theta=30 degrees, I got d≈3.49, which doesn't make sense because it's smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake and the correct formula should give a larger d.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - 2 hk cos(alpha) - 2 hl cos(beta) - 2 kl cos(gamma) )

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 -3√3 )

Which is impossible because the denominator is sqrt(negative).

So perhaps the correct formula is the inverse, but I don't know.

At this point, I'm stuck and perhaps I should look for the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which for theta=30 degrees and (111):

d=10/sqrt(3 +3√3 )≈3.49.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric tensor approach: the reciprocal of the interplanar distance is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

So,

|G| = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) / a²

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Because in the metric tensor approach, the formula is:

|G|² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)c/a²,

where c is cos(theta).

So,

|G| = sqrt( (3 + 3√3) ) /10 → |G|=sqrt(8.196)/10≈2.864/10=0.2864.

So,

d=1/|G|=1/0.2864≈3.49 Angstrom.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, which is approximately 10 / sqrt(1.05), because sqrt(1.05)=1.024 →10/1.024≈9.765 → close to 9.54, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 / sqrt(1.1111)=10/1.054≈9.49, which is close to option B)8.95, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom.

After all, I'm not making progress, and the options suggest that the correct answer is around 9 Angstrom.

Based on this, I'll make an educated guess and choose option C)9.54 Angstrom.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\alpha + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866)}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
The denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 2(3 \cdot 0.866)} = \sqrt{3 + 3 \cdot 0.866 \cdot 2}
\]

\[
\sqrt{3 + 3 \cdot 1.732} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196}
\]

\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.864
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( d \)
\[
d = \frac{10}{2.864} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Analyzing the result
The calculated value of \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are in the range of 8–10 Å. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the formula or interpretation. Given the options, the most plausible answer based on the problem setup and the need for a larger interplanar distance due to the 30° angles is **option C) 9.54 Å**.

### Conclusion
While the detailed calculation yields \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), this does not align with the provided options. Based on the reasoning and the need for a larger interplanar distance, the best choice is:

**Answer: C**
