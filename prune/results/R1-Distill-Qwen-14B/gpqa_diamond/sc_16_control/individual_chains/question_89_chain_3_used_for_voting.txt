Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-shaped molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons in that structure. 

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C leads to a product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H, which might be an -OH or an -OR group. But wait, in IR, the 1720 peak is strong for carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. But the 4.79 ppm with 2H could be adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, considering KOH is a strong base, perhaps elimination is happening.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an elimination reaction. But in adamantane, each carbon is bridgehead, so maybe the reaction is more about dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromo... if each Br is on a bridgehead, elimination would form a double bond. But double bonds in adamantane are tricky because of the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, heating with KOH might lead to dehydrohalogenation. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on adjacent bridgeheads. When KOH is added, each Br could leave, and the hydroxide could abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. But wait, wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of something like a ketone. Or maybe it's a diepoxide? No, KOH isn't typically used for that.

Wait, looking at the NMR data: 4.79 (2H) could be an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or maybe an alcohol. But the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1800. Alternatively, it's a ketone. So the product after KOH is a diketone?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon dehydrohalogenation with KOH, would lose two HBr molecules and form an allene (a conjugated diene), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. Wait, another thought: Maybe KOH is causing an elimination, but in this case, since it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, allowing for a double elimination to form a double bond. That would make 1,3-dibromoadamantane into an alkyne? No, wait, elimination usually forms alkenes. But adamantane is already a rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but with two bromines, it's more likely elimination. Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via a pinacol-like mechanism. But wait, pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols losing water to form a carbonyl. Hmm, but here we have DBr groups. Maybe if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination occurs, but how would that form a ketone?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a ketone group. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH₂ next to oxygen. Maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent oxygen group. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another angle: When dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, especially when heated, elimination can occur. If the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and the base abstracts beta hydrogens, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two bridgeheads. But since it's 1,3, maybe that's not directly possible. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination forms a bridged diene. But I'm not too certain about that.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. So maybe another approach: perhaps the dibromide is undergoing a Hoffman elimination or some kind of dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, Hoffman elimination is for amides, but maybe there's a similar process here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a conjugated diene. But then, how do we get a ketone? Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Alternatively, could the reaction form a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation to form a cycloketone. For instance, if two adjacent Br atoms are removed and oxygen comes in, forming a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of each Br being eliminated as HBr, but since there are two Brs, maybe two eliminations happen, leading to formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, the reaction of a vicinal dihalide with strong base can lead to elimination, forming either an alkene or, in some cases, a ketone. Oh, wait, I think I remember that when a 1,2-dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate to form a carbonyl if the structure allows. But in this case, it's a 1,3-dibromide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen that's adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But in adamantane, that's a bit tricky. Maybe in this case, the base abstracts a hydrogen from each Br, leading to formation of a bridged double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone. No, I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH₂- group. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 near a carbonyl. And the 2.41-2.23 region (10H) are probably the bridgehead protons, which are usually around 2.2-2.4 in adamantane derivatives.

So if the product is a ketone, perhaps it's a secondary or tertiary ketone. Wait, if the product is 1,3-diketone, but the NMR doesn't show multiple carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-ketone.

Wait, here's another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, and the product is a bridged diketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the IR, which shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a ketone group. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a deshielded proton. That could be a CH₂ connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol. But if it's a ketone, how does that fit?

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol? No, IR doesn't show broad O-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. But epoxide's carbonyls usually appear around 1200-1050 cm⁻¹, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent oxygen-containing group. For example, a cyclic ether ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would require two OH groups, which would show up in IR as a broad peak around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonyl group with an adjacent ether oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent ethyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution. But substitution would typically give alkanes, not ketones.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ketone. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a bridged cycloketone. For example, when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a double bond, but in this case, perhaps it's a bridgehead double bond, which is possible in some structures. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach. The initial product after KOH has a carbonyl group. So maybe elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, when vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihalides) are treated with strong bases, they can eliminate to form ketones in some cases, via a dehydrohalogenation mechanism. For example, if the dihalide is a vicinal dihalide, elimination can form a ketone. But in this case, it's a 1,3-dihalide. So perhaps in adamantane, the 1,3-dibromide allows for a similar elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromide is not vicinal. So how would elimination form a ketone? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the dibromide to undergo a ring-opening. But since adamantane is a very stable structure, ring-opening would be difficult.

Hmm... Maybe I should think about the product structure. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH₂ group attached to an oxygen. For example, OCH₂CH₂O, but that's an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH₂ group attached to an oxygen, like an alcohol or an ether.

The IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cycloketone. So for example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, elimination would form a double bond, but that might not give a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing the elimination of two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of a bridgehead ketone. So, if you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and you eliminate HBr from each, you might form a carbonyl group at each bridgehead, but that would give a 1,3-diketone. However, the NMR doesn't show multiple carbonyls, so maybe not.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H). Let's think about what that could be. It's a singlet for 2H, which might be a CH₂ group attached to an oxygen. So maybe it's an ether, like OCH₂CH₂O. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H) as a singlet, so maybe it's an -OCH₂- group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone with an ethylene oxide ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would require two OH groups, which might show up in the NMR as a broad peak. However, the question says to exclude exchangeable protons, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 ppm is an -OCH₂CH₂- group as part of an epoxide ring. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the next step and see if that helps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, maybe for some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a work-up step after ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them and forming carbonyl groups.

So the initial structure must have a double bond, which would be cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups in product 3.

Looking at the options for the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding exchangeable ones.

So let's tie this together. Product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 comes from treating it with Al(i-Pr)3. Maybe product 2 is a diene, which would then undergo ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. If product 2 is a diene, perhaps product 1 has a ring that is being opened or reorganized in the presence of Al isopropoxide. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent double bond. But then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a diene.

Hmm. Let's think again. Product 1: after KOH, it's a ketone. Product 2 is formed by heating with excess Al isopropoxide, which could cause elimination. So if product 1 has a structure like a cycloketone with an adjacent hydrogen, perhaps it loses a molecule (like water) to form a double bond, making it a dienone or a conjugated diene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexenone, and product 2 is an endo-trig diene or similar.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on what product 1 is. Let me try to think of a reaction where 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a ketone.

Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a bridged carbonyl. For example, each Br is eliminated, and the two carbons become carbonyl groups. But that would form a bridged ketone, perhaps making a diketone.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lose two HBr molecules to form a bridged diene, but that might not form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't straightforward. Maybe it's a pericyclic reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a bridgehead double bond, which is then hydrogenated, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, maybe the product after KOH is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tertiary alcohol, but the IR doesn't support that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the overall process. The second step forms product 2, which is then ozonolyzed to form product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 1 must have a structure that, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, leads to a compound with a double bond.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond. Enol ethers can form from ketones under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but without exchangeable protons, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid), perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction to form an enone (a conjugated ketone with a double bond). For example, a dehydration to form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, that makes sense. So product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated dienone perhaps). Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would form two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a dienone, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But let me think about the structure. Suppose product 1 is a ketone, say, at a bridgehead. Then, product 2 is an enone, with a double bond adjacent to the ketone. Ozonolysis of that would form two carbonyl groups, perhaps leading to product 3 with more carbonyls.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. Specifically, what's the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding exchangeables.

So, in product 3, after ozonolysis, I'm expecting carbonyl groups and perhaps some CH₂ groups adjacent to them. The most deshielded proton would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, when you cleave a double bond, you typically form carbonyl groups on each side. So if product 2 has a structure like R-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-R, wait no, that's not quite right. Ozonolysis tends to break the double bond into two carbonyls. For example, if the double bond is between carbons a and b, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups: R₁CHO and R₂CHO, depending on the structure.

But in adamantane derivatives, the structure is more rigid. So maybe product 3 has two carbonyl groups, and some CH₂ groups adjacent to them.

But how does that relate to coupling patterns? The most deshielded hydrogen would be near the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl.

In such a case, the hydrogen would be adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps coupled with neighboring protons. Let's say the structure is something like CH₂(CO)–CH₂– something else. But in a more rigid structure, the coupling might be with two different sets of protons.

Wait, the ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would produce two carbonyl groups. But let's think about the specific structure. Suppose product 2 is a dienone, like:

R-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-R'

After ozonolysis, each double bond would break. Wait, no, ozonolysis usually breaks each double bond into two carbonyls. So if the structure has a double bond, say between C1 and C2, then ozonolysis would cleave to form two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic dienone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, making two new carbonyls.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about product 3's structure. After ozonolysis, product 3 has carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps in a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl.

In such a case, the hydrogen would couple with the adjacent CH₂ group. If the group is CH₂(CO)–CH₂–, each hydrogen in the CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet for each, as each hydrogen is split by two neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but that's if it's a simple CH₂–CH₂–CO group. Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, like a bridged bicyclic compound, the coupling might involve more neighbors.

Wait, another possibility: if the hydrogen is next to a CH group, then the coupling would be more complex. For example, if the structure is CH₂–C(R)=O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, leading to multiple couplings.

Wait, but the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet. So the coupling patterns suggest multiple neighboring protons.

If the hydrogen is adjacent to two different sets of protons, it might split into a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, considering that the hydrogen is next to a CH₂ group, which itself is next to another CH₂ group, each coupling would split the signal.

Wait, let's imagine a structure like:

O= C – CH₂ – CH₂ – C = O

After ozonolysis, perhaps it's split into two carbonyl groups. So the middle part would have CH₂ groups. The H's on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be split by their neighboring CH₂'s.

But in such a case, each hydrogen on the CH₂ would be adjacent to two H's on the next CH₂. So each H would be a quartet (n+1 where n=3?), but that's not one of the options. Wait, no, each H on the CH₂ would be coupled with two H's from the adjacent CH₂. So each H on CH₂ would have a triplet (n=2, so triplet). But wait, if the adjacent CH₂ is part of a different group, perhaps it's more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is more like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O

Then, the middle CH2 groups would couple with each other. The CH2 next to the carbonyl (CH2A) would be split by the adjacent CH2B. Each H on CH2A would be next to two H's on CH2B, making each a triplet. Similarly, the H's on CH2B would be split by CH2A and perhaps another group.

But wait, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break the molecule into smaller fragments. So perhaps product 3 is two smaller molecules, each with a carbonyl group.

But then, the NMR would show protons from each fragment. The most deshielded H would be in the smaller fragment, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a bridged bicyclic dienone, ozonolysis would break the bridge, forming two carbonyl groups, and the resulting structure might have CH groups adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is an enol ether, which has a double bond. Ozonolysis of this double bond in product 2 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps each attached to a CH₂ group.

The most deshielded H would be on a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH₂ would be split by adjacent H's. For example, if the structure is CH₂(CO)–CH₂–X, where X is another group, then each H on the CH₂ next to CO would be adjacent to the H's on the next CH₂.

Wait, but in that case, each H on CH₂(CO) would be coupled with two H's on the adjacent CH₂. So each H on CH₂(CO) would be a triplet. But what if there's another coupling, like from another adjacent group?

Alternatively, if there's a bridge or another CH₂ group nearby, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the CH₂ group next to CO is also adjacent to another CH group. For example, in a structure like CH₂(CO)-CH(CH3)-..., then each H on the CH₂ would couple with the CH group's H.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, a triplet of triplets implies two different coupling constants, each leading to triplet splitting. A doublet of triplets would mean coupling with two different sets, each of which is a triplet. A pentet is five peaks, which would come from four neighboring H's, perhaps in a CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ situation.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH₂-CH₂ group, each H on the first CH₂ would be split by the two H's on the next CH₂. So each H would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But what if the H is also adjacent to another group, like a CH with two H's, leading to more splitting?

Hmm. Let me try to imagine a specific structure. Suppose product 3 has a structure like CH₂(CO)-CH₂-CH₂-CO. Then, the H's on the central CH₂ would be coupled with the adjacent CH₂ groups on both sides. Each H on the middle CH₂ would be split by the two H's on each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other, but wait, that might not be the case because they are all part of the same CH₂ groups.

Wait, no. In that structure, the middle CH₂ (CH₂B) is between CH₂A and CH₂C. Each H on CH₂B would be next to two H's on CH₂A and two on CH₂C. That would lead to each H on CH₂B being split into a triplet from CH₂A and another triplet from CH₂C, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

But wait, in reality, the coupling between CH₂A and CH₂B would be through the adjacent CH₂B and CH₂C. So each H on CH₂B is adjacent to CH₂A and CH₂C. Each adjacent CH₂ has two H's, so each would contribute a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

But the question asks for the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be closest to the electronegative group, like the carbonyl. So that would be the H's on the CH₂ next to the CO.

So if the structure is CH₂(CO)-CH₂-CH₂-CO, then the CH₂ next to CO (CH₂A) is adjacent only to CH₂B. Each H on CH₂A would be split by the two H's on CH₂B, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but that depends on the exact structure. Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH₂, the coupling could be more complex.

Another angle: the most deshielded H would be on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a structure like CH2(CO)-CH2-CH2-CO wouldn't have CH groups. So maybe the structure is CH2(CO)-CH(CH2X)-..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis cleaves a bridge, leading to a structure where the H is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)

In this case, the CH2 group adjacent to CO would have each H split by the CH's H's. Wait, but CH has three H's. So each H on CH2 would be split by the three H's on CH, leading to a quartet (n=3 → quartet). But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of a different approach. The initial product after KOH is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treatment with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Common reactions with Lewis acids include Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but the starting material is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's causing an elimination to form an enol ether or an enone.

If product 2 is an enone (a conjugated dienone), then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

The coupling pattern of the most deshielded H would be in the structure adjacent to the carbonyl. Suppose the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

Then, the H's on the CH2 next to CO would each be adjacent to two H's on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH(CH3)-... In this case, each H on the CH would be adjacent to three H's (from the CH3 and any other groups), but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which is also adjacent to another CH2 group. That would make each H a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, if the H is on a CH2 group that's next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group, each H would be split by the two H's on each adjacent group. That would be a triplet from the first adjacent group, and each of those would be split again by the next group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two H's. So each H would be split into a triplet by the first CH2 and another triplet by the second, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Looking back at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, and option C is doublet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a CH group. So the H on CH2 would be split by the two H's on the next CH2 (triplet) and perhaps by another group, like a CH with two H's, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the H is on a CH2 that's adjacent to a CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Given the options, I think the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but why triplet of triplets? Because each H is coupling with two H's on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet from each, which combines into a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another group with two H's, like a CH2.

So, for example:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-X

Each H on the first CH2 (next to CO) would be split by the two H's on the second CH2, leading to a triplet. Each H on the second CH2 would be split by two H's on the first and two on the third, leading to a triplet of triplets. But the most deshielded H would be the first CH2, which is next to CO, so it's a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded H. So the H adjacent to CO would be the most deshielded. If that H is on a CH2 next to another CH2, it would be a triplet.

But then the answer would be option A) triplet.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities. If the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 next to another CH2, then triplet. If it's on a CH adjacent to two CH2 groups, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure leads to a doublet of triplets. For example, if the H is on a CH that's next to a CH2 and another CH2, with two different coupling constants.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-...

In this case, the H on the first CH2 (next to CO) would be coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. The H's on the second CH2 would be coupled with two H's on the first and two on the third, leading to a triplet of triplets. But the most deshielded H is on the first CH2, which is a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, making option A correct.

But earlier, I thought it might be a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the coupling is with more than two H's. For example, if the H is adjacent to a CH group with two H's and another CH2 with two H's, the coupling could lead to a doublet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. I think, given the options and the reasoning, the most likely is a triplet, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, followed by treatment with aluminum isopropoxide and ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3) based on the provided reaction sequence and spectral data.

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-Dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH at 240°C. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests that the product is likely a ketone. The reaction likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone group.

### Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide
Product 1 (the ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This step likely induces further elimination or rearrangement, forming a compound (product 2) that contains a double bond. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step targets double bonds.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. The final product (product 3) will have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were cleaved.

### Step 4: Analysis of Product 3
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is expected to be adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on its neighboring groups:
- If the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, the hydrogen will be split into a **triplet** due to coupling with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂.
- If there are additional couplings (e.g., with hydrogens from another group), the pattern could become more complex, such as a **triplet of triplets** or a **doublet of triplets**.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This occurs if the hydrogen is coupled with two equivalent hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs if the hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on one adjacent CH₂ group and two hydrogens on another group.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This occurs if the hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on one group and three hydrogens on another group.
- **D) Pentet**: This occurs if the hydrogen is coupled with four equivalent hydrogens, which is unlikely in this structure.

Given the reaction sequence and the expected structure of product 3, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is a **triplet**, as it is adjacent to a single CH₂ group with two hydrogens.
