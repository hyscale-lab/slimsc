Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But here, the problem isn't using strong 1:1 acids and bases, so it's a bit more complex.

I remember that for neutralization reactions, the enthalpy change depends on the amount of H+ and OH- ions reacting. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases about 57 kJ (or 13.6 kcal, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, actually, 57 kJ is about 13.56 kcal. So each mole of H+ reacting with OH- gives off about 13.56 kcal.

But wait, the problem is mixing different solutions. I need to find the total moles of H+ and OH- produced, but first, I think I should figure out which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down step by step. First, calculate the moles of each acid and base.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. HCl → H+ + Cl-. So the moles of H+ from HCl are:

Molarity × Volume (in liters) = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, and it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much can react.

Which one is the limiting reagent here? Let's see: H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. OH- is less, so it will limit the reaction. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.2 moles of H+ will be used.

So the amount of H+ left is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the excess H+? Because after neutralization, any remaining H+ will contribute to the solution's acidity, but for the enthalpy of neutralization, I think we only consider the amount that actually neutralizes the OH-.

So the reaction uses 0.2 moles of H+ (since OH- is 0.2) and 0.2 moles of OH-.

The enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. Each mole of H+ + OH- produces 1 mole of H2O, releasing 57 kJ (or 13.6 kcal) per mole.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. So the calculation is based on the heat released when the acid and base react. But when there's an excess of H+ or OH-, only the amount that actually reacts contributes to the neutralization enthalpy.

So in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles. So the reaction is:

0.2 moles of H+ + 0.2 moles of OH- → 0.2 moles H2O.

So the heat released would be 0.2 moles × 57,000 J/mol. Wait, wait, the units in the options are mixed, kcal and kJ. Hmm, the options have A and B in kcal, C in kcal as well, D in kJ.

Wait, let me think. 1 calorie is 4.184 joules. So 1 kcal is 4184 J.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole, which is about -13.56 kcal per mole.

So for 0.2 moles, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J. Or in kJ, that's -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, in kcal: 0.2 × (-13.56) ≈ -2.712 kcal.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem is about the total enthalpy change when all three solutions are mixed. So we have to consider all H+ and OH- from each solution.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by calculating the total moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

When they react, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.2 moles of H+ will be used. Remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. Each mole releases 57 kJ, so total is 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, enthalpy is exothermic, so it's negative. So -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. That's about 11.42 kcal. Hmm, but I just calculated 11.4 kJ. So that's a discrepancy because 11.4 kJ is about 2.7 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is about -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the units. Because the options have both kcal and kJ. Let me compute both possibilities.

So 0.2 moles × 57,000 J/mol = 11,400 J → 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So that's not matching. Alternatively, if the calculation is in kcal: 0.2 moles × 13.6 kcal/mol = 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- produces 0.2 moles of water, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, 57 kJ is per mole of H2O, so per mole of H+ + OH- → H2O, it's 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles → 11.4 kJ.

So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger than 11.4. So that can't be the case.

So if the options have both kJ and kcal, which one is correct? Let me check the options:

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

So if the calculation is in kJ, it's -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D (-16.0 kJ)? No, wait, no. 11.4 is close to option D? No. Option D is -16, which is more than 11.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation regarding the moles.

Wait, let me double-check all the steps.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+ → correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+ → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles → correct.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2 → correct.

Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 moles H+ neutralized → correct.

So enthalpy is 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → but that's option D: -16.0 kJ is not matching. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Ba(OH)2 contributes more OH-. Wait, no, 0.5 M × 0.2 L is 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 moles OH-, correct.

Another possibility: maybe the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is not 57 kJ but something else? Or perhaps the problem accounts for all the H+ ions, including those that don't neutralize.

Wait, no, because the neutralization enthalpy only considers the H+ and OH- that actually react. The excess H+ would contribute to the solution's heat capacity, but the neutralization is only for the amount that reacts.

Wait, but what if the problem is considering the total H+ available, regardless of the OH-?

Wait, that can't be. Because the neutralization can't proceed beyond the limiting reagent. So we only have 0.2 moles reacting.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes, the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated based on the concentration of H+ and OH- in the solution, regardless of their sources. So perhaps the total H+ and OH- are considered in equivalence.

Wait, but in this case, the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the equivalence point is when H+ = OH- → but here, H+ is more, so OH- is limiting.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- from all the solutions, but that's not how neutralization works. When you mix them, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, so only the initial moles of each matter.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, leading to 11.4 kJ, but that's not one of the options except for option D, which is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in calculating the moles.

Wait, wait, maybe I should re-calculate the moles of each.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles → correct.

Yes, that's correct.

So the neutralization uses 0.2 moles, giving 11.4 kJ. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking again:

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than 11.4.

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.4 kJ (since 11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ). Hmm, that's higher than 11.4 kJ.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total enthalpy change, including any excess H+ or other reactions?

Wait, but in this case, after neutralization, we have excess H+ (0.08 moles). But that doesn't contribute to neutralization; it just affects the solution's pH. The enthalpy of neutralization is strictly for the acid-base reaction, so only the 0.2 moles contribute.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the total heat released in the reaction, considering the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing enthalpy of neutralization per mole with the total heat for the reaction.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole, but the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change for this particular mixing. So the total would be 0.2 moles × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ → which is approximately -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's larger. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the number of moles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the minimum.

Wait, H+ total: 0.28, OH-:0.2. The moles reacting are 0.2. So the heat is 0.2 × 57 =11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. Wait, looking at options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the reaction in terms of equivalents. For H2SO4, each mole gives 2 equivalents of H+, so 0.09 moles × 2 = 0.18 equivalents. Ba(OH)2 gives 2 equivalents of OH- per mole → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 equivalents.

So total equivalents of H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 eq. Equivalents of OH- = 0.2 eq. So neutralization is 0.2 eq reacting. So 0.2 equivalents, each releasing 57 kJ per mole of H2O, so 0.2 ×57 kJ= 11.4 kJ.

So it's the same conclusion.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is looking for the enthalpy in kcal. 0.2 ×13.56 kcal/mol = 2.712 kcal → approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Hmm, that would make sense. Because option A is -2.72 kcal, which is 2.72 ×4.184≈11.4 kJ. So that's the same value but expressed in kcal.

Wait, but why would the answer be in kcal? Because the standard enthalpy is often given in kJ per mole, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal. So in that case, 0.2 moles ×13.56 kcal/mol → 2.712 kcal → rounded to 2.72, which is option A.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is more than 11.4 kJ. Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal.

So if the calculation is in kJ, it's -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. But if it's in kcal, it's -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 ×4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. That would require 0.835 moles of reaction, which isn't the case here.

So I think the correct answer is -2.72 kcal, option A.

Wait, but why is option B given? Because sometimes, when you have H2SO4, the second H+ might not dissociate completely, especially in a solution with excess H+? No, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ ions are released completely in aqueous solution.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes two H+ → which I did. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate the total H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.1 moles H+ → correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 ×0.3=0.09 → 0.18 H+ → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 ×0.2=0.1 → 0.2 moles OH- → correct.

So the limiting is OH- → 0.2 moles. So 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ → which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But why is option B there? Oh, because 0.2 moles ×57,000 J =11,400 J → 11.4 kJ → which is 2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

Wait, but the options have A as -2.72 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ. So the correct answer is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ releases 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Since OH⁻ is present in fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \)), it is the limiting reactant.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for 1 mole of H⁺ and OH⁻ forming water is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.56 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - From the limiting reactant, \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of OH⁻ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺.  
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Converting to kcal: \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-13.56 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.712 \, \text{kcal} \), which rounds to \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

4. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This is incorrect, as it represents an enthalpy change larger than the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** This is incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** This is incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
