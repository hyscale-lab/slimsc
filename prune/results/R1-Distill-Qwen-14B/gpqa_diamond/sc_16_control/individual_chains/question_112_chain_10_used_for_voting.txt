Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D with different probabilities and average values.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I need to normalize this state. Because when they say it's proportional, it means it's a scalar multiple, but the actual state should be normalized to 1.

So, let's compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. Wait no, wait. Wait, the state is proportional to that, which means it's equal to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but scaled by some constant. So first, I have to find the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let me compute that.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2 +i) multiplied by |up><up| + (1+i)(2 - i) multiplied by |down><down| + cross terms?

Wait, no. Let me compute <alpha|alpha> properly. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is zero except when they are the same.

So, <alpha|alpha> = (1 - i)(1 + i) + (2 + i)(2 - i).

Because when you take the inner product, the |up> and |down> parts will multiply their coefficients and sum. So, for the |up> part: (1+i) multiplied by its conjugate (1-i), so (1-i)(1+i). Similarly, the |down> part: (2 - i) multiplied by its conjugate (2 +i).

Let me compute these:

(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1*(1) + 1*i -i*1 -i*i = 1 +i -i -i². i squared is -1, so this becomes 1 +0 +1 = 2.

Similarly, (2 +i)(2 -i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Wait, but the question says the state is proportional, so it's equal to that. So the actual |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, but multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down (two states). Let me write down the matrix.

The operator's matrix would be:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are zero.

Hmm, what's this operator? It looks like it's a symmetric operator, maybe proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if this operator were hbar/2 times sigma_x, then that would match. Because sigma_x has 0 on the diagonal and 1 off-diagonal. So, yes, this operator is (hbar/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenstates of σ_x are the |+x> and |-x> states. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of this operator would be ± hbar/2.

Wait, but the question says, calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities would be the square of the amplitudes of these states in |alpha>.

But wait, how do I express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of this operator? Alternatively, I can find the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the operator and find the eigenstates. Let me think.

The operator A has matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So, determinant of [ -λ   hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2  -λ ] equals zero.

Which is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

So λ² = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = hbar/2:
(A - (hbar/2) I ) v =0 → [[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] v =0.

Which gives equations:
- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 ⇒ v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the matrix would have (hbar/2, -hbar/2), leading to v1 = -v2. So the eigenvectors are (1, -1) normalized.

But wait, let me compute the normalized eigenvectors.

For λ = hbar/2: v = (1, 1)/sqrt(2). Because normalization is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2: v = (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Because the spin eigenstates for σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So yes, that's correct.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Express this as a combination of |+x> and |-x>.

We can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Because:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)

|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ] + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [1/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) ] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Let me expand this:

= [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i))|-x> ]

Compute the coefficients:

For |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + 2 + i -i = 3.

For |-x>:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me double-check the expansion:

Wait, original expression is (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>).

Expanding:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>

Grouping terms:

|+x> [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] + |-x> [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Which is |+x> [3] + |-x> [ (1+i -2 +i) ]

Which is |+x> [3] + |-x> [ (-1) + 2i ]

So yes, that's correct.

So the coefficients are 3 and (-1 + 2i), respectively.

So, the amplitude for |+x> is 3 / sqrt(14), and the amplitude for |-x> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability for each eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of these amplitudes.

Compute the probabilities:

For |+x>:
|3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9 /14 ≈ 0.642857.

For |-x>:
| (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |² = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571429.

Wait, but wait, the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. So that's close to 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14≈0.3571. So yes, 0.64 and 0.36, but wait 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So A has 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer would be 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, right? Then the normalization is sqrt( (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 +i) ) = sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So yeah, correct.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients are 3 and (-1 + 2i), so their squares are 9 and (1 +4)=5.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which would round to 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is the operator with eigenvalues ±hbar/2, and |alpha> expressed as a combination of the eigenstates, the expectation value would be the weighted average of the eigenvalues by the probabilities.

So, the expectation value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Which is [ (9 -5) hbar ]/(2*14) ) → (4 hbar)/(28) ) = (2 hbar)/14 = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says average is hbar/7. So the first part (probabilities) is 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7. So option A matches.

But let me check the other parts. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value directly using the matrix elements.

Yes, let me compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So the bra vector is (1-i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) <down|.

Operator A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of (bra) and (A multiplied by the ket).

Compute A|alpha>:

A |alpha> = [0 (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So,

First component (coefficient of |up> in A|alpha>):

[ (hbar/2) (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ (2 -i) hbar /2 ] / sqrt(7)

Second component (coefficient of |down>):

[ (hbar/2) (1 +i) ] / sqrt(7 )

So, now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * [ (2 -i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ] + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * [ (1 +i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the bra is (1-i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2 +i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So when you take the inner product of <alpha| and A|alpha>, you need to multiply each bra component with the corresponding ket component.

So:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 - i) / sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(1 + i) / sqrt(7) ]

Factor out (hbar/2) * (1/7) from both terms.

So,

= (hbar/(2 *7)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i².

i squared is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i².

Which is 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So adding these two terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the entire expression becomes: (hbar/(14)) * 2 = hbar/7.

So yes, the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → correct.

Option D says 2 hbar /sqrt(7) as average, which is much larger. So option A is correct.

The problem involves an electron in a quantum state described by \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle \), where \( |{\uparrow}\rangle \) and \( |{\downarrow}\rangle \) are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Key Steps:
1. **Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|{\uparrow}\rangle + (2-i)|{\downarrow}\rangle \). Normalization is performed using the condition \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The normalization factor is found to be \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \), so the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle.
   \]

2. **Operator \( A \):**
   The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
   \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   This is equivalent to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli x-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

3. **Expressing \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):**
   Using the relations \( |{\uparrow}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) \) and \( |{\downarrow}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \), \( |\alpha\rangle \) is rewritten as:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} |+x\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} |-x\rangle.
   \]

4. **Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):**
   The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
   \[
   P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
   \]
   \[
   P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Average value of \( A \):**
   The average value is computed as:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting the eigenvalues and probabilities, the expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{9}{14}\right)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \left(\frac{5}{14}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of the operator \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.
