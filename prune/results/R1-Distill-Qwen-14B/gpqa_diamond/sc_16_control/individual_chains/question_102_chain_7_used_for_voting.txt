Alright, so I've got this pretty complex question about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up in some mice. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, first, let's understand the setup.

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're trying to study their interaction's developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. So, I know that coiled-coils often form structures that can be secreted or membrane-bound, depending on other features.

The construct they made is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So, each of these (ligand and receptor) is under their own promoters or regulatory elements. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can drive translation of the downstream ORF, even if the upstream one is translated.

Now, the cassettes: between ligand and mCherry is a stop with loxP sites, and between the receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272 sites. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, right? LoxP is the standard one, while lox2272 is a variant that is compatible only with certain Cre strains because it's a different recombination site. Oh, right, when Cre is expressed, it can cause the lox sites to recombine, deleting the intervening DNA. So, in the vector, the ligand is followed by a stop cassette; I think that means that without Cre, the stop would prevent expression of the mCherry, but when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed? Or wait, perhaps the way it's set up is that the ligand is under a promoter, and then the ORF is followed by a stop with loxP. So, the idea is that in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed along with the stop, preventing any downstream mCherry expression. But with Cre, the loxP sites would recombine, removing the stop, so the mCherry would be expressed in the same transcript as the ligand.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand is under the CBA promoter, then the ORF, then a loxP-stop-loxP, then the receptor with IRES, followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then the eGFP.

Wait, no, actually, the ligand is at 5' position, under the CBA promoter. Then comes the ligand ORF, followed by a stop with loxP cassette. Then comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272 cassette and eGFP.

So, when Cre is present, the loxP sites will recombine. Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different. So, the Cre would recognize each pair. So, the loxP sites around the ligand's stop cassette would recombine when Cre is present, removing the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 sites around the receptor's stop cassette would recombine, removing that stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed.

Wait, no. Wait, the loxP sites are in the ligand's stop cassette, and the lox2272 in the receptor's. So, to recombine, you need specific Cre strains. For example, if you use the same Cre strain for both, but lox2272 is a mutated site that only recombines with a specific Cre variant. Oh, wait, more accurately: the loxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for Cre. The standard loxP is recognized by wild-type Cre, while lox2272 is a mutant site that is only recognized by CreER or another variant. So, perhaps in this case, the Cre used can only cut one of them, or both?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

The construct is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs: the ligand (5') and the receptor (3'). Each is under different regulatory elements. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, then the ligand ORF, then a stop with loxP sites. Then comes the IRES, and the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272 sites and eGFP.

So, when Cre is introduced, it will cause the loxP sites to recombine. Wait, but lox2272 is a different site, so if the Cre can recognize both, then the stops in both cassettes would be removed. But perhaps only one of the stops is supposed to be removed, depending on where the Cre is active.

Wait, but in the setup, they've used a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then, they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, SOX10-Cre mice would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So, the Cre would be active in those cells, leading to recombination in the construct.

The idea is that in the presence of Cre, the loxP and lox2272 sites would be cut, removing the stop cassettes. So, the ligand would be expressed, followed by mCherry, and the receptor would be expressed, followed by eGFP.

But in the experiment, when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal (eGFP). So, why is the eGFP not expressed?

The options are A to D.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how would that affect the expression of eGFP? Hmm, not directly. If the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, perhaps the receptor is not on the same cell as the ligand. But in this case, the construct is designed so that both are expressed in the same cell, unless the ligand is secreted. But the question is about the expression of eGFP, which is part of the receptor construct.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not transported to the cell surface, so the eGFP might not fluoresce. But then, why would the Western blot show eGFP? Or perhaps the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Wait, the question says they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression by Western blot. So, after transfecting into primary astrocyte cultures, they saw signals proportional to actin. But wait, in the Western blot, what's the result? Oh, wait, the question says that the Western blot showed a signal proportional to the actin loading. So, perhaps the proteins are being expressed, but in the mice, the eGFP isn't showing up.

Wait, the problem says that after cross to SOX10-Cre, the offspring were born and visualized under confocal, and no green signal (eGFP) was observed.

So, the Western blot in vitro (transfected into astrocytes) showed that the constructs were being expressed. But in the mouse model, after Cre is introduced, the eGFP isn't expressed. So, why?

Wait, maybe the issue is with the construct's design. Let me think about the vector setup again. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which might mean that it's expressed in a different way. Wait, the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So, how is that arranged?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning it's a single transcript that has two ORFs. How does that work? Usually, bicistronic vectors have a promoter, then the first ORF, then a RBS (like IRES) for the second ORF. But in this case, the ligand is under CBA, so that's the promoter for the first ORF. Then comes the ligand ORF, followed by a stop cassette. Then, the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by another stop cassette and eGFP.

Wait, but if the ligand and receptor are on the same transcript, then the presence of the IRES would allow the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA. But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed. So, when Cre is present, the stop after the ligand is removed, meaning that mCherry would be expressed along with the ligand. Similarly, the stop after the receptor is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse, why isn't eGFP expressed? Let's go through the options.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF of the receptor is not in frame with eGFP, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But wait, the receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the receptor would be expressed as a fusion protein with eGFP. If the stop cassette is correctly removed, the eGFP should be expressed. But if the lox2272 sites didn't recombine, the stop would remain, preventing eGFP expression.

But why wouldn't the lox2272 sites recombine? Because maybe the Cre isn't able to recognize them. Wait, the construct is homozygous in the wt background, and then crossed to SOX10-Cre. So, the Cre is being expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. But if the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites, then the stop cassette remains, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed beyond the stop.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different. Lox2272 is a variant that can only be recognized by Cre if it's a lox2272- Cre variant. No, wait, I think the opposite: lox2272 is a site that is only cut by Cre when in a certain configuration. Let me think. The standard loxP is 34 bp, and lox2272 is a 34 bp variant. The key is that lox2272 cannot be cut by wild-type Cre. So, for recombination to happen at lox2272 sites, you need a Cre that is compatible, perhaps a mutant Cre like Cre-ER or something else. So, in this case, if the Cre being used is wild-type, it can't cut lox2272. So, the stop cassette after the receptor remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the question says they crossed the homozygous construct to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So, the Cre is under SOX10 control, which is a wild-type Cre, I think. So, if the lox2272 sites require a Cre variant that can't be cut by wild-type Cre, then the stop cassette after the receptor remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed. Thus, the eGFP wouldn't be produced, so no green signal.

So, in the mouse model, the Cre can only cut the loxP sites, but not the lox2272 sites. So, the ligand's stop is removed (allowing mCherry expression), but the receptor's stop isn't removed (so eGFP isn't expressed). Hence, when they look for eGFP fluorescence, there's nothing.

But looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't correctly fused, but that's a genetic construct issue, not a Cre issue. Alternatively, option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. But why would the eGFP not be expressed if it's a fusion?

Wait, another thought: the vector is bicistronic. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So, when the Cre is active, the stop is removed from both cassettes. So, both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But perhaps the issue is with the IRES element. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor might not be expressed. Alternatively, if the IRES is correctly allowing translation of the receptor, but the eGFP isn't properly being expressed.

Wait, the construct is designed so that the receptor is followed by the eGFP. So, if the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, then upon Cre recombination, the stop is removed, and the eGFP should be expressed. But if the lox2272 site isn't being cut, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by the Cre, meaning the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Why? Because the Cre can't recognize lox2272 sites.

So, the correct answer would be that the Cre isn't able to cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem if the construct wasn't designed correctly. But the question states that the vector was designed with the ligand at 5' and receptor at 3', with the correct stop cassettes. So, if the lox sites are correct, the frame shouldn't be an issue. Unless the recombination didn't happen.

Wait, but the answer options don't directly mention the lox sites or Cre's ability to cut them. So, perhaps the issue is different.

Another angle: the IRES element is used upstream of the receptor. IRES elements are often used to allow internal initiation of translation, so the receptor ORF can be translated even if the ligand is not. But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but the construct was tested in primary astrocytes via Western blot, and the proteins were expressed. So, the issue isn't that the construct isn't working in vitro. It's only not working in the mouse.

Wait, but why? Because in the mouse, the Cre is only active in neural crest cells, perhaps. So, in the primary astrocyte culture, the construct might have been transfected in a way that didn't require Cre, or the cells were treated with something to induce Cre (like Tamoxifen for Cre-ER). But in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So, the construct is in the mouse, and when the Cre is active, the stops are removed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, so the stop must still be present. So, the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites. But why?

If the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains in place. So, in that case, the stop is still there, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop isn't removed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, looking at the options, none of them directly state this. So, which option relates to this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the lox2272 sites weren't cut, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So, perhaps this is the issue. Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working.

Wait, but the presence of the stop cassette affects the expression. If the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the problem is that the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites, meaning the stop remains.

But why? Because the lox2272 sites can't be cut by the Cre in use. So, perhaps the vector uses lox2272 and the Cre used is wild-type, which can't cut it.

So, the correct option would be that the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Which of the options matches this?

Looking again, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That doesn't directly affect the expression of the eGFP.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then eGFP wouldn't fluoresce, but why would the Western blot detect it? Probably, the Western blot would show that the protein is expressed but not properly trafficked, but the question states that the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter, so this is unlikely.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Alternatively, if the eGFP isn't in frame, it wouldn't be made. But why would the stop not be removed? Because the lox2272 wasn't cut.

Wait, but the question says that the plasmid was transfected into primary astrocyte culture, and the Western blot showed signals. So, in vitro, the construct works. So, the problem must be in the mouse model, where the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites.

So, the issue is that the lox2272 sites can't be cut by the Cre, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly address this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but if the lox2272 sites aren't cut, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop remains. So, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working. If the IRES can't drive translation of the receptor, even if the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in that case, why would the Western blot show the presence of the proteins?

Wait, in the primary astrocyte culture, they used the construct, and the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So, the proteins are being expressed, which suggests that in vitro, the stop cassettes are being removed. So, in vitro, the Cre must have cut both lox sites. But in the mouse, perhaps only the loxP sites are cut, not the lox2272.

Wait, but in primary astrocytes, how would Cre be induced? Unless the construct was designed to be activated upon certain conditions, like in the presence of an inducer. But the question doesn't specify that. So, perhaps the primary astrocytes were transfected with the construct without Cre, so the stops are still in place. But the Western blot showed actin signals, meaning the proteins were expressed. That doesn't make sense. Unless the primary astrocytes were treated with something else.

Wait, perhaps the primary astrocytes were transfected, but without Cre, the stops would prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. But the question says that the Western blot was used to test the construct's expression. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so perhaps they're detecting the ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot detects the overexpressed proteins (the ligand and receptor), not the fluorescent tags. So, the presence of the ligand and receptor in the Western blot suggests that their ORFs are being expressed, which would require that the stops were removed. Because if the stops were present, the ORFs would not be expressed beyond the stop.

Wait, that's confusing. If the ligand's stop is in a loxP cassette, then without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, meaning the ligand wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot shows that the ligand is expressed. So, perhaps in the primary astrocytes, Cre was present, allowing the stops to be removed. So, the ligand and receptor are expressed, along with the fluorescent proteins.

But in the mouse, the same construct is present, but only in the presence of Cre from SOX10-Cre. So, the stops are supposed to be removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

So why no eGFP in the mouse?

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because the IRES isn't working. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame.

Wait, the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So, when the ligand's stop is removed, the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot in vitro showed that the receptor was expressed, so the IRES must be functional.

So, another angle: the problem could be with the lox sites. If the lox2272 sites require a specific Cre variant, and the Cre used (SOX10-Cre) is wild-type, it can't cut the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the stop remains in the receptor's cassette, preventing eGFP expression.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop isn't removed. Therefore, the eGFP remains under a stop cassette and isn't expressed.

So, looking at the options, the reason why eGFP isn't expressed is that the stop cassette isn't removed, meaning the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. The only option that explains a failure in eGFP expression is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, which is because the Cre can't recognize them. But none of the options explicitly state this.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't being expressed as part of the same ORF. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed at all, not just being out of frame.

Wait, maybe the initial construct had the ORFs in the wrong reading frame. For example, if the lox2272 cassette isn't removed, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the lox2272 sites are cut, the eGFP should be in frame.

But the main issue is that the stop isn't removed, regardless of frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut. So, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. So, this would correspond to option D if the reason why the stop remains is because the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the receptor's stop cassette isn't correctly flanked by lox sites, so even after Cre recombination, the stop remains. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Another approach: which option is most likely correct based on the setup.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP isn't in frame, it might not be expressed, but that would be a problem with the construct design, not the Cre activity. But the construct was transfected into astrocytes and the proteins were expressed, which suggests that the construct works in vitro. So, the issue must be in the mouse, which is an in vivo situation.

Another thought: the IRES may not function in the same way in vivo as in vitro. For example, the IRES might require certain conditions or cell types to be active. If the IRES isn't working in the mouse, the receptor might not be expressed, preventing eGFP expression. But in vitro, the IRES worked because the Western blot showed the receptor was expressed.

Alternatively, the problem is that the eGFP is not correctly spliced or something else.

Wait, but if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So, the issue is the stop is present, which would be because the lox2272 sites weren't cut.

So, from the options, the only one that relates is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem could be that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop isn't removed, and this is due to the IRES not working. So, the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be translated, so the eGFP isn't expressed either. But in that case, the receptor wouldn't be seen on the Western blot, which it was.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The key point is that the mouse doesn't show eGFP fluorescence, but the primary astrocytes do. So, perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't activating.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. Then, they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. When the offspring are born, they're supposed to have Cre activity in neural crest cells. But perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active, so no Cre is expressed, so the stops aren't removed. But that would mean that in the mouse, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. But the question says the mouse model is in a wt background, so the Cre is active.

Alternative possibility: the vector's lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, the lox2272 sites might be in a way that Cre can't cut them. But that's a construct design issue.

Wait, another thought: the vector has a stop in a loxP cassette after the ligand and a stop in a lox2272 cassette after the receptor. The Cre is introduced, which can cut loxP sites but not lox2272. So, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, only mCherry would be expressed in the mouse, but not eGFP.

So, the stop after the receptor isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

Which option matches this?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. No, that's about the construct's ORF, not about the stop.

Option B: the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. If that were the case, the eGFP would be present but not at the cell surface. But the Western blot would show the receptor is expressed. The question says that the Western blot didn't show any issues; it was proportional to actin, suggesting the proteins are expressed.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, the problem says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after the IRES. So, perhaps in the mouse, only the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't because the stop remains. So, the issue is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the stop isn't removed.

But the options don't have that as an option. So, perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't working in the mouse, so the receptor isn't expressed, but the Western blot would have shown that.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me consider each option again.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So, the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on another cell. But in this case, the construct is in the same cell, so paracrine would mean they can't interact. But the question is about the expression of eGFP, not the interaction. So, probably not the answer.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP is in the Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce. But then, the Western blot would have detected the eGFP, but perhaps only in the lysate. But the question says the Western blot showed signals, which suggests the proteins are expressed. So, maybe this isn't the issue.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so an enhancer isn't necessary. So, this is unlikely.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed as a fusion. But if the stop is removed, perhaps the eGFP is expressed as its own ORF. Wait, the construct is receptor followed by stop, then eGFP. No, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor, right? So, the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So, if the stop is present, the receptor is expressed but not the eGFP. If the stop is removed, the eGFP would be expressed as part of the same ORF.

Wait, no. If the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, then the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the eGFP is under a stop, which is not removed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't directly address this.

Wait, another angle: the eGFP is fused to the receptor. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't part of the same ORF, so it isn't expressed. But the receptor is expressed, as shown in the Western blot.

So, the issue is that the stop between the receptor and eGFP hasn't been removed, preventing eGFP expression. The reason the stop hasn't been removed is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

Therefore, the correct answer isn't directly listed, but the closest is D, which suggests the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORFs aren't in frame. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not correctly spliced, but that's also not an option.

Wait, looking back, the question says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at 3' fused to eGFP. So, perhaps the stop after the receptor isn't removed, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the correct answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is due to the lox2272 sites not being cut by Cre.

But among the options, the only one that would explain the eGFP not being expressed is D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites are not in the correct orientation. For example, if lox2272 is in a forward and reverse direction, the Cre can't cut. But that would be a construct design issue, not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not compatible, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought: the IRES is after the ligand ORF, which is why the receptor is expressed. But if the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor along with eGFP, but only the ligand's stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But in the mouse, perhaps only the ligand's stop is removed, not the receptor's. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which would be the case if the Cre can only cut loxP and not lox2272.

So, the answer would be that the stop isn't removed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. But which option addresses this?

The options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But in reality, the issue is about the stop cassette not being removed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because if the lox2272 stop cassette wasn't properly removed, the eGFP wouldn't be in frame with the receptor.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor, so it should be in frame. If the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed as part of the same ORF. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP's expression is under a stop cassette that isn't removed because the lox2272 sites aren't recombined. So, the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, leading to the stop remaining. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But since none of the options directly address this, perhaps the correct answer is D. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the Western blot. The question says that the Western blot, after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture, shows a signal proportional to actin. So, they're detecting the ligand and receptor, implying that in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed, allowing the ligand and receptor ORFs to be expressed. Therefore, the vector works in vitro, but in the mouse, it doesn't. So, the problem must be in the mouse's Cre.

In the mouse, the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter. So, Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. If the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

So, the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. But why? Because lox2272 requires a specific Cre variant, perhaps CreER, but in the question, they're using wild-type Cre. So, the wild-type Cre can't cut lox2272, meaning the stop remains.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, no. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place, not because they're not in frame. So, D isn't the correct answer.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

If the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, that would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because it's in a different reading frame. But in reality, the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't even initiated.

But the Western blot in vitro would have shown the ligand and receptor, meaning that the stops were removed. So, in the mouse, the stops should have been removed, but maybe they're not.

So, why aren't the stops being removed in the mouse? Because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So, the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't mention this. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't working, but the Western blot suggests it is.

Another angle: the vector is bicistronic with the IRES. So, the receptor is expressed only if the IRES is functional. But in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed, and thus eGFP isn't either. But again, the Western blot showed that the receptor was expressed in vitro, implying the IRES works.

Hmm. I'm going to have to go with option D as the answer, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The construct includes stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after the ligand and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette after the receptor. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, where Cre is expressed under the SOX10 promoter in neural crest cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of eGFP, which is part of the receptor construct. The lack of eGFP expression is unrelated to the ligand-receptor interaction being paracrine. This option does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would not fluoresce at the cell surface. However, the Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed proportionally to actin loading, indicating that the receptor and eGFP are being synthesized. This suggests that the issue is not with trafficking but rather with expression. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under the IRES element, which is functional in driving translation. There is no evidence to suggest that an enhancer is missing or required for expression in this setup. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed as part of the same ORF. However, the Western blot showed that the receptor was expressed, indicating that the construct is functional in vitro. The issue in vivo is likely related to the failure of the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette to be removed, preventing eGFP expression. This could occur if the Cre used cannot recognize lox2272 sites, which are distinct from loxP sites. While this reasoning aligns with the observed result, the phrasing of the option does not directly address the stop cassette or Cre compatibility. Nevertheless, this option is the closest match to the problem described.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the stop cassette after the receptor (lox2272-stop-lox2272) was not removed because the Cre used cannot recognize lox2272 sites. This prevents eGFP expression. While none of the options explicitly address this issue, the closest match is **Option D**, as it implies a failure in expressing eGFP due to a construct-related problem.
