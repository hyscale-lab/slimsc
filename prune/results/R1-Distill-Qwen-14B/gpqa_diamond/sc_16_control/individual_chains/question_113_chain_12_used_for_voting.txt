Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, it's a broad peak, which makes me think maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, but sometimes it's hard to tell. Also, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds). Hmm, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring or an amide, but since there's no mention of NMR peaks that suggest amide protons, maybe that's not it.

Wait, but another strong peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl. So maybe this compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching) or maybe an conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an O-H bend? No, O-H bends are usually lower, like around 1600 maybe, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, could the 1650 be a C=O that's conjugated or in a different environment?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. But then why would there be a broad peak at 3000? That O-H stretch suggests an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But if there's a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester or ketone with an alcohol group. Or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, which matches the first peak. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the FTIR would have a broad peak from O-H (the -COOH group). The 1700 cm^-1 would be the carbonyl (C=O) stretch in the carboxylic acid. But then what about the 1650? Hmm, maybe that's an aromatic ring. But wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, for example, the 1650 could be the C=C in the benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't aromatic but has conjugated double bonds elsewhere. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide's C=O stretch, but the problem doesn't mention any NMR peaks that would suggest amide protons. So perhaps that's not it.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. So vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, which would make me think of an alkene group. So probably, the molecule has both a carbonyl group and an alkene. Or perhaps an ester and an alkene?

So, putting this together: O-H (maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid), carbonyl (maybe ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc.), and an alkene group.

Looking at the mass spec data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Wait, m/z 45 is a common fragment. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH2OH? No, wait. Wait, 45 is often a fragment for (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's not an option here). Or wait, maybe it's the molecular ion of something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular weight of an ethyl group attached to something. Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O (which would be 3*12=36 +7=7 +16=16 → 36+7+16=59, no, wait that's not right. Wait, 45: 45 is 12 + 12 + 12 +  ... Wait, 45 divided by 12. 3.75 carbons. Hmm, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

So let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen.

For option A: C6H12O2 → DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one DoU could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU = (14 -10)/2= 4/2=2. So two degrees, like a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU = same as B but subtract O, but wait, the formula is (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 → (14-10)/2=2 again. So DoU=2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O: DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (so at least one DoU). The FTIR has a carbonyl group, which is another DoU. So the total DoU should be at least 2.

So looking at the options, options B and C have DoU=2, while A and D have DoU=1. So the correct compound must be either B, C, A, or D. Wait, if the DoU is at least 2, then options A and D (with DoU=1) are unlikely. So the possible answers are B and C.

So we can eliminate options A and D.

Now, back to the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 is O-H. So the compound has an O-H group. So looking at the options, B is C6H10O, which would have one O. So maybe an alcohol. C is C6H10O2, which has two O's. So possibilities: maybe a diol, but more likely an ester or a carboxylic acid.

But if the compound were a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad (which matches the FTIR), and the 1700 cm^-1 would be the C=O stretch. And if it's a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps the 1650 is the C=C in the benzene ring. But wait, the options don't have a benzene ring necessarily; the molecular formulas don't show enough H to imply aromatic rings.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have a carbonyl group. The FTIR would show the ester's carbonyl around 1700. The O-H (from the alcohol in the ester, but esters don't have O-H; wait, no, esters are O-C-O, so they don't have O-H unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. So maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group elsewhere. So perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but that's if it's a diester. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester and an alcohol, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group, but that would have two O's. So the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A). Wait, but earlier we thought options A and D were out because they have DoU=1, but if the compound has a ketone (another DoU) and an alcohol (O), that would be two DoU, but the formula for option A is C6H12O2, which has DoU=1. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, for option A: C6H12O2. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → 14-12=2→ 2/2=1. So DoU=1.

But if the compound has a carbonyl (DoU=1) and an O-H, which is an alcohol, which doesn't require a DoU but adds an O. So in that case, the compound would have a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alcohol group. So that would make sense. Then, the NMR would have vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond (another DoU). Wait, but that would require DoU=2, but formula A only has DoU=1. So that can't be. So perhaps option A is out.

Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl (DoU=1), an alcohol (no DoU), and a double bond (DoU=1), then total DoU=2. But formula A has DoU=1, so that's impossible. Therefore, the compound can't be option A.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline what I know:

- FTIR: O-H (probably alcohol or carboxylic acid), and two carbonyls maybe? Or a carbonyl and another group. Wait, the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe one is a carbonyl (like C=O) and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C (so 1650). So the compound would have a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. But the molecular formulas don't have enough H for a benzene ring (which is C6H5, which is 5 H), but the options have 6 carbons and varying H.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present (so DoU +1). The carbonyl is another DoU (+1). So total DoU=2. So the compound must have DoU=2. That leaves options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2).

So let's consider each.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation=2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, etc. Let's say it's a cyclic ether with a double bond. But the FTIR has O-H, so maybe it's an epoxide with an alcohol? Not sure. Or maybe it's a diol, but that would require more O's. Wait, option B has one O. So perhaps it's a cyclic ether with an alcohol substituent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond. The O's could be from ester groups or a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

Wait, considering the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think of what that could be. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (which is 45, but that's not a common fragment). Alternatively, 45 could be (CH2O) (formaldehyde is 30, but that's not it). Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O (but that's not a common fragment either). Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: common fragments. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe the fragment is from the ester group breaking off. The ester group is R-O-CO-O-R', but usually, the fragments might come from the cleavage of the ester. Alternatively, in the case of an ester, the (CH2)2O group could fragment to give a certain mass. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethylene group (C2H4, which is 28), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)3O, which is 45? Let me calculate:

CH2CH2CH2O: that's 3 carbons and 7 H and one O. Molecular weight: (3*12)+(7*1)+(16) = 36 +7 +16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, 45 is 12*3 + 1*3 + 16*0 = 45? No, 3 carbons would be 36, so 36+9=45. So maybe C3H9? But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2O—wait, (CH2)2O is 12*2 + 2*2 +16=24+4+16=44. Close to 45 but not quite. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an acetylation. For example, if the compound has an acetyl (COCH3) group, the loss might give a certain fragment. Wait, the acetyl group would contribute to the molecular ion, but a fragment at 45 could be the loss of something.

Alternatively, in the case of a ketone or ester, the cleavage could produce a fragment with a carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule breaks after the carbonyl, the fragment could be (COO-) etc.

Wait, another way: the molecular formulas. Let's see:

Option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12) +10 + (16*2) =72 +10 +32= 114.

If during mass spec, the molecule breaks into a fragment with m/z=45, which is about a third of the molecular weight. So perhaps it's a small fragment. Maybe a fragment from the ester group, like losing the R-O- group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a structure like R-O-CO-R'. The ester group can fragment in different ways. For example, the ester might break into R-O and the COOR' part. If R is CH2CH2, then R-O would be (CH2CH2O-) which has a molecular weight of 12*2 +6 +16= 24+6+16=46. Close to 45. Hmm, but that's 46, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2CH2 group (28) plus something else. But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl ester or something similar. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, if the compound is methyl propionate, the formula would be C3H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2, which is double the size. So maybe it's a diester or a larger ester.

Alternatively, the fragment at m/z=45 could be from an ester group. For example, if the ester is ethyl something, the (CH2CH3) group would be 43 (since CH2CH3 is 29, but maybe with oxygen, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 44, but again, not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, which would be a DoU of 1. The FTIR shows a carbonyl (another DoU of 1), so total DoU is 2, which matches options B and C.

Now, considering the O-H in the FTIR, which options have two O's? Option C is C6H10O2. So if the compound has an O-H (like an alcohol) and a carbonyl group (like an ester or ketone), and a double bond, that would fit.

So perhaps the structure is something like an ester with an alcohol group and a double bond. For example, maybe an allyl ester with an alcohol substituent. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another point: the FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is more likely a carboxylic acid O-H or an alcohol. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the molecular formula would have O2. For example, a benzoic acid derivative would have COOH group (two O's). So that's option C.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: a carboxylic acid has the formula CnH2nO2. So for n=3, it would be C3H6O2, but our option C is C6H10O2, which is n=3 in a different arrangement. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the mass spec. If the molecular ion is at m/z=114 (for option C), and there's a fragment at 45, maybe it's losing a group of 69 (114-45=69). But I'm not sure what that would be.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an ethyl group. Wait, 45 is 12*3 + 1*3=45. So perhaps a propyl group attached to something. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage after the carbonyl. For example, if the compound is an ester like O-CO-O-R, then the cleavage could produce a fragment with the COO group and the rest. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NMR data can help. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so the structure has an alkene. So the molecule has a carbonyl (like an ester or ketone), an O-H group (alcohol or carboxylic acid), and a double bond.

Putting it all together, the most likely structures for option C would have DoU=2, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring plus a double bond.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have a ring structure with a carbonyl. So the FTIR would show the carbonyl around 1700. The O-H would be from an alcohol group, but in a lactone, the O is part of the ring. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, a lactone may not have an O-H group. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a double bond conjugated to a carbonyl, which might explain the 1650 cm^-1 peak if that's the conjugated C=C. So the FTIR 1700 is the carbonyl, and 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

In that case, the structure would have both a carbonyl and a double bond, fitting the DoU=2. The O-H from the FTIR would suggest an alcohol group elsewhere.

So the formula would have two O's: one from the ester (or carbonyl) and one from the alcohol. So that's option C, C6H10O2.

Now, looking at the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be from the ester group. For example, the ester group might lose the R-O- part, leaving the COO- which would be 60 (12*2 + 16*2=48 +16? Wait, COO- would be 44 (12+16*2=44). But the fragment is 45, which is one more than that. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with an ethyl group, the fragment could be the ethyl group plus oxygen. But I'm not getting it exact.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures include esters, carboxylic acids, ketones with an alcohol group, etc.

If it's a di-ester, for example, but that's less likely given the molecular formula.

Alternatively, it's an ester with a double bond and an O-H group. For example, perhaps an allyl ester with an alcohol substituent.

Alternatively, it's a cyclic ester with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

But regardless, the key point is that option C has two O's and the DoU=2, which fits the data.

Another point: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the structure must have a double bond, which is accounted for in the DoU.

Putting it all together, the data points towards option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The molecular formula options are **C₆H₁₂O₂**, **C₆H₁₀O**, **C₆H₁₀O₂**, and **C₆H₁₂O**. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic C=C stretch.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** (protons on a double bond) indicates the compound contains a double bond, contributing to the degree of unsaturation (DoU).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This is consistent with a small fragment, possibly from an ester or alcohol group.

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
- **DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2** (assuming no halogens or nitrogen):
  - **C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1.
  - **C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2.
  - **C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2.
  - **C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1.

The presence of a double bond (from vinyl hydrogens) and a carbonyl group (from FTIR) implies a **total DoU of 2**. This eliminates **C₆H₁₂O₂** and **C₆H₁₂O**, as they only have a DoU of 1. The remaining options are **C₆H₁₀O** and **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

### Elimination of Options:
- **C₆H₁₀O**: This formula has one oxygen atom. While it could represent an alcohol with a double bond, it does not account for the carbonyl group suggested by the FTIR data.
- **C₆H₁₀O₂**: This formula has two oxygen atoms, which can accommodate both a carbonyl group (e.g., ester or ketone) and an O-H group (alcohol or carboxylic acid). The FTIR data aligns well with this formula.

### Conclusion:
The FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data are consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**, which has the required DoU of 2, accounts for the O-H and carbonyl groups, and matches the observed fragment peak at m/z = 45.
