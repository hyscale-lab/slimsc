Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty of P_z given a state vector. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like ΔP_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this as |ψ⟩. And the matrix for P_z is given. Let me write that down.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix, which makes things easier because its eigenvalues are on the diagonal.

The first thing I need to do is compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Let me compute each component.

Let me write |ψ⟩ as a column vector:
[ -1/2 ]
[ 1/sqrt(2) ]
[ -1/2 ]

So, P_z |ψ⟩ is the product of the matrix and the vector.

Calculating each component:

First component: (ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2

Second component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = 0

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z |ψ⟩ is:
[-ħ/2]
[0]
[ħ/2]

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I take the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ (which is the row vector [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]) and multiply by P_z |ψ⟩.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4

Wait, no. Wait, (-1/2) * (-ħ/2) is (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term is zero.

Third term: (-1/2) * (ħ/2) = - ħ/4.

So, adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element.

So P_z² matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]

Which is:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, ħ² ]

So now, I have to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Again, I can compute P_z² |ψ⟩ first.

P_z² |ψ⟩ is:

First component: (ħ²)(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = - ħ² / 2

Second component: 0, since the second row is all zeros.

Third component: (ħ²)(-1/2) = -ħ²/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the third row of P_z² is [0, 0, ħ²], so the third component is ħ²*(-1/2) = - ħ²/2.

So P_z² |ψ⟩ is:

[ - ħ² / 2 ]
[ 0 ]
[ - ħ² / 2 ]

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ times this vector.

Again, |ψ⟩ is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2)

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Second term is zero.

Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), so that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up a sign or a matrix multiplication.

Wait, when I calculated P_z |ψ⟩, the third component was ( -ħ/2 ) times (-1/2) from the third entry? Or wait, no. Let me recheck.

The P_z matrix is:

Row 1: ħ, 0, 0

Row 2: 0, 0, 0

Row3: 0,0,-ħ

So when I multiply P_z by |ψ⟩, which is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

First component: ħ * (-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second component: 0.

Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2.

So yes, correct.

Then ⟨P_z⟩ is (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2) = (ħ/4) + 0 - (ħ/4) = 0. Correct.

P_z squared is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ). So when I multiply by |ψ⟩, each component:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) → - ħ²/2.

Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) → - ħ²/2.

So yes, correct. Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is [ -1/2 * (-ħ²/2) ] + [ ... ] + [ -1/2 * (-ħ²/2) ].

Each term is (1/2)(ħ²/2) → ħ²/4. So two of them, sum to ħ²/2. Correct.

So ΔP_z is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 ), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\psi\rangle$ multiplied by $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\psi\rangle$ multiplied by $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$.

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
