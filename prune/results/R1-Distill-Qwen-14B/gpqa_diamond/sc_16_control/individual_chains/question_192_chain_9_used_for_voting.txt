Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor's radius is R, and the cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, if I imagine the big sphere, the small cavity is somewhere off-center, right?

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that for conductors, charges reside on the surface. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the presence of the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, how does that work again? So, when you place a charge inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have the same charge as the inner induced charge. Because the conductor as a whole remains neutral, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Or wait, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So the charge inside the cavity is +q. The cavity is inside the conductor, so the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q to balance it.

Wait, no. Wait, think again. The conductor is neutral, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must cancel each other. So, if the cavity has +q, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the conductor's total charge is zero. So when we're outside the conductor, the field should be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor... No, wait. Wait, the outer surface's induced charge is +q, but how does that distribute?

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, right? But the cavity is off-center. So the conductor is conducting, so the charges on the inner surface can't just stay in place; they redistribute based on the field from the charge inside.

Wait, the cavity is not at the center. The center is separated by s from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So, the induced charge on the inner surface of the conductor will be -q, but where? Since the conductor is a sphere, perhaps the induced charges arrange themselves in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. Hmm.

Wait, but for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. That's a key point. So any charges induced on the inner surface must arrange themselves such that the field within the conductor is zero.

But the cavity has a charge +q. The inner surface of the conductor, which is just the wall of the cavity, must have a charge of -q. But since the cavity is off-center, the distribution of that -q charge on the inner surface would be non-uniform. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so maybe the induced charges on the inner surface would be such that their field cancels the field from +q inside the conductor. Hmm.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so when calculating the electric field there, I should consider the charges outside that point. So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the conductor was neutral, and the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q. So the electric field at a point outside the conductor would be as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is the same as if the charge was at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so the field outside depends on the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface. So according to Gauss's law, the electric field at point P (outside the conductor) would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/r², where r is the distance from the center of the conductor.

In this case, the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

But wait, point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The problem states that l is greater than R. So the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, which is larger than R. So the field at P should be due to the conductor's outer charge, which is +q.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere with radius R, so any point outside (like P) would have an electric field as if the charge +q was at the center of the conductor. So the direction would be radial from the center of the conductor. Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is at the center of the cavity, which is a distance s from the conductor's center.

So, the position of the charge +q relative to the Gaussian surface (point P) doesn't affect the field at P because the field is determined by the total charge outside up to that Gaussian surface. Wait, no, because for a point outside a sphere, the field depends only on the total enclosed charge and the distance from the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is off-center. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the field outside the conductor is as if all the +q were at the center of the conductor. So for point P, which is outside, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the conductor's center to P.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? The charge +q is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. But since the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, the field outside is determined by that +q at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity.

Because the conductor being a conductor, the charges on the outer surface are free to move and distribute themselves such that the field outside depends only on the total charge, not on the distribution inside.

So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field due to the conductor's outer charge is as if the charge was concentrated at the center. So, regardless of where the +q is inside the cavity, the field outside is the same as if it were at the center.

So in this case, the correct answer would be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the center of the conductor. The field outside the conductor is as if the total charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of Gauss's law.

3. **Effect of the Off-Center Cavity**:  
   The cavity is off-center, and the charge $+q$ inside the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. However, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$, and not by the position of the charge inside the cavity. The field outside the conductor is therefore independent of $s$, $l$, or the angle $\theta$.

4. **Calculation at Point $P$**:  
   Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using the formula for the electric field outside a spherical charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor. Incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor. Correct.  
   - **Option C**: This expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor. Incorrect.  
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends on $l^2$, but the field outside the conductor depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
