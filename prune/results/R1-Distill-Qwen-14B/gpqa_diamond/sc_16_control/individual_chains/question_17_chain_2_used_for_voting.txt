Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed here is Ca-EDTA. So, the complex is dissociating into calcium ions and EDTA ions in solution. The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²+].

The formula for the stability constant, K, for a complex ion like Ca-EDTA would be the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the individual ions. So K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait a second. EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in different protonated forms. The problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that all the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-. So I don't have to worry about the different species; it's just the simple expression.

So, the complex is in solution, and it's dissociating as Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

Given that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which I'll call C. Since the dissociation is 1:1, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will each be x at equilibrium.

Wait, but wait again. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that it dissociates completely (but that's not the case because the stability constant is high, which implies that the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much). Wait no, stability constants being high mean that the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the degree of dissociation is very low, so x is going to be small compared to 0.02.

So let's think about the initial setup.

Initial concentrations:
[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change:
[Ca-EDTA] decreases by x, so becomes 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x → x

So K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10

Wait, so K is 5x10^10. So I can set up the equation: 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Let me solve for x.

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5 )e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x² = 4e-13 (wait, because 2/5 is 0.4, but 0.4e-12 is 4e-13?)

Wait, 2e-2 is 0.02. So 0.02 divided by 5e10 is (0.02)/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13).

The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-12 is 1e-6, because (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12. So 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, no, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Because 6.5 * 2 = 13. Let me think, 1e-13 is 10^-13, so the square root is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

Wait, but 4e-13 is the same as (2e-6.5)^2. So the square root is 2e-6.5. Let me compute 2 times 10^-6.5. 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, so that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )
We have [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, and both [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are x.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2), so x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * (1e-6.5) ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, that makes sense. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given:
- \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \)
- \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \)

Assuming the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the high stability constant, let the equilibrium concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Then:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
