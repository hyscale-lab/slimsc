Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several fusion processes. The main one is the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has a few branches. I think the pp-I branch is the main one, but there are others like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. So I need to focus on that.

The problem states that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, that's the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth, right? So if the core fusion stops, it takes that time for the change to be noticeable here. But how does this affect neutrino flux?

Neutrinos are produced in fusion reactions. The pp-III branch must produce some neutrinos. Let me recall: the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a helium-3 nucleus with a proton, producing a helium-4 nucleus and two positrons and two neutrinos. Oh wait, wait. No, the pp-III process is when two helium-3 nuclei (He-3) combine to make a helium-4 (He-4), releasing two protons, and emitting two neutrinos. So each pp-III reaction produces two neutrinos.

But wait, the main neutrino emission in the Sun is from the pp-I branch, which is the dominant process. The pp-I branch produces a boron-8 (B-8) nucleus, which then decays into two alpha particles, releasing a lot of energy and producing neutrinos. The neutrinos come from the decay of B-8, which has a half-life of about 2 million years, but the flux depends on how much B-8 is being produced.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III process contributes to the total neutrino flux. So if it stops, the flux would decrease by the amount that pp-III was contributing.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of two specific neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find how the pp-III stopping affects these two bands.

I remember that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are lower energy than those from the B-8 decay. Because the pp-III reactions produce neutrinos with energies around a few hundred keV. B-8 decays produce higher energy neutrinos, like several MeV.

So the neutrinos from pp-III are in the lower energy range. So if pp-III stops, the flux in the lower bands would decrease more than the higher ones.

Looking at the bands, band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900. If the pp-III branch was the main source for the lower energies, stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1 more than in band 2. Because band 2 is higher energy, perhaps it's more dominated by B-8 neutrinos.

So if pp-III was a significant contributor to band 1, the flux in band 1 would drop, while band 2 stays roughly the same. So the ratio (flux1 / flux2) would decrease.

But wait, neutrino flux also depends on the production rates. Let me think about the proportions. The pp-III branch contributes a certain amount to the overall neutrino flux. The main contributor is probably the B-8 decay, which is part of the pp-I branch.

So when the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that source (lower energy) stop, so the flux in band 1 goes down, but band 2 is higher energy and not affected as much. So the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would drop.

But what's the typical ratio? I think that the B-8 neutrinos make up a large fraction of the solar neutrino flux, especially in the higher energy bands. So without pp-III, the lower band's flux would be lower relative to the higher band.

In the past, experiments like the Kamiokande and others measured the solar neutrino flux. The pp-III neutrinos contribute to the lower energy part of the spectrum. So if they stop, the lower energy flux drops, making the ratio of band 1 to band 2 smaller.

So the question is asking for the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2). If pp-III was the main source for band1, then without it, flux1 would be much lower than flux2. So the ratio would be much less than 1.

What are the options? The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

So, if the ratio is less than 1, the options are B, D, or C. But how much?

I think the pp-III neutrinos are a significant but not dominant part. Maybe they contribute about 10% or so of the total solar neutrino flux. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the energy spectrum. The B-8 neutrinos have energies up to about 16 MeV (I think), with an average around 5-6 MeV. So the 800-900 keV band is way below that, so perhaps most of that band is from lower-energy sources.

Wait, no. Wait, 800 keV is 0.8 MeV, much lower than B-8's neutrinos. So perhaps the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) are in the range of lower-energy neutrinos, which I think are from the pp-III process.

If pp-III stops, then the neutrino flux in these lower energy bands would drop. But wait, the pp-III process produces neutrinos in a lower energy range, but I'm not certain about the exact energy bands.

Wait, from what I remember, the pp-III process (He-3 + He-3) produces two neutrinos per reaction. Each of these neutrinos has an energy of about 16 keV on average. Because the Q-value of the He-3 + He-3 reaction is about 12.86 MeV, and the neutrino energies sum to this, but each gets about 16 keV each. So their energies are around tens of keV.

So the neutrinos produced in the pp-III process are much lower energy than the B-8 neutrinos, which are about 5 MeV on average. So the bands in the question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) are way above the pp-III neutrinos. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, if the pp-III neutrinos are only around 16 keV each, then the bands in question are much higher. So their fluxes are not affected by the pp-III stopping. Then why is the question about this ratio?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the processes. Alternatively, maybe the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are from other processes.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the dominant B-8 decay have a spectrum that peaks around ~4-5 MeV. So the flux in lower energy bands (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) is much lower compared to higher bands. Wait, but how does the pp-III stop affect this?

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III process are in the lower energy range, so when they stop, the flux in their band drops, but the higher bands (like B-8) are not affected.

Wait, the bands in the question are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). These are both around 0.7 to 0.9 MeV.

If the pp-III neutrinos are at around 16 keV, then the bands are way higher. So the flux in these bands would primarily come from where? Maybe from the B-8 decay. So if the pp-III process stops, does that affect the higher energy bands? Because B-8 is part of the pp-I process, which is still ongoing.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So the B-8 production continues.

So, the neutrino flux in bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV would still be coming from B-8 neutrinos, which are unaffected by the stopping of pp-III.

But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the pp-III process doesn't contribute to these higher energy bands, then stopping it would have no effect on these fluxes. So the ratio would remain as before.

Wait, but the question is, what is the ratio after the pp-III stopped. So the neutrino flux in these bands would be the same as before, but some part is missing.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which neutrinos are affected. Let me think: the neutrinos from the Sun come from different sources. The dominant source is the B-8 decay, which is part of the pp-I process. Then, there are other processes, like the CNO cycle, but I think they contribute less to the neutrino flux.

Wait, wait. No, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos too. The CNO cycle's neutrinos are from the decay of N-13 and O-15, and their energies are higher, around several MeV. So the higher energy neutrinos come from B-8 and CNO cycles.

But the lower energy neutrinos (like tens of keV) come from the pp-III process. So the 700-800 keV band is way higher than the pp-III neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the flux in lower keV bands (like 0.1-0.2 MeV) would decrease, but the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would remain unaffected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV). If both are from the same source (B-8 decay), then the ratio depends on the shape of the neutrino energy spectrum.

The B-8 neutrino energy spectrum is such that higher energy neutrinos are less in number. So in the 700-800 keV band, there are more neutrinos than in the 800-900 keV band. So the flux in band 1 is higher than band 2, so the ratio would be greater than 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III process stops. If the pp-III neutrinos were contributing to a lower band, but not these bands, then the ratio would be the same as before.

Wait, but the question is a hypothetical scenario. So perhaps the pp-III process contributes neutrinos in a different part of the spectrum?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm incorrect about the energy of the pp-III neutrinos. Let me think again: the pp-III process is He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2p + 2ν. The Q-value is about 12.86 MeV. Since two neutrinos are emitted, each carries away about 6.43 MeV, but that's if they share the energy equally. But neutrinos are relativistic, so their energy distribution depends on the specifics.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh, maybe I made a mistake earlier. He-3 has a mass of about 2.993 amu each. Two He-3 would be about 5.986 amu. He-4 is about 4.0026 amu. Two protons are about 2.014 amu. So the total mass before is 5.986, after is 4.0026 + 2.014 = 6.0166 amu. So the mass difference is 5.986 - 6.0166 = -0.0306 amu. So Q = 0.0306 amu * 931 MeV/amu ≈ 28.5 MeV.

Wait, that's much higher than what I thought earlier. So the Q-value is about 28.5 MeV. So two neutrinos are emitted, so each would carry about 14.25 MeV on average. That's way higher than what I thought earlier.

Wait, that can't be right because I remember that the pp-III neutrinos are low energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Let me get the correct process.

The pp-III branch is the He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2p + 2ν. So the Q-value is the energy released in this process.

The mass of He-3 is about 3.016 amu each. So two He-3: 6.032 amu. He-4 is 4.0026 amu. Two protons are 2.014 amu. So total after is 4.0026 + 2.014 = 6.0166 amu. The initial mass is 6.032 amu. So the mass difference is 6.032 -6.0166=0.0154 amu.

So Q = 0.0154 *931 ≈ 14.37 MeV.

So the total energy released is about 14.37 MeV, which is split between the two protons and the two neutrinos. The kinetic energy of the two protons would be about (14.37 - 2 * m_p c² ), but wait, the protons are part of the product, right?

Wait, the Q-value is the total kinetic energy available. The actual energy distribution would go into the kinetic energy of the products. The protons are much heavier than the neutrinos, so they would carry away most of the energy, with the neutrinos taking a small fraction.

Wait, but each neutrino would have energy much smaller than the protons. So for each neutrino, the energy would be a few keV, not MeV.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting info here. Let me think: the mass difference is about 0.0154 amu, 14.37 MeV. The total energy goes into kinetic energy of the products. The two protons and two neutrinos.

Since the protons are much heavier, their kinetic energy would be significant. The neutrinos, being light, would carry away only a small fraction. But perhaps each neutrino gets a few keV.

So, the neutrinos from the pp-III process have energies on the order of tens of keV each. So their energies are around 10-20 keV. So their flux is in the 0.01 to 0.02 MeV range.

In the question, the bands are 700-800 keV (0.7 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to these bands. So if the pp-III process stops, the flux in these higher bands (0.7-0.9 MeV) wouldn't be affected, as they're from B-8 decay.

Wait, but B-8 decay produces neutrinos with energies up to about 15.5 MeV. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV band is well within the B-8 neutrino spectrum.

So the neutrinos in band 1 and 2 are from B-8 decay. The pp-III neutrinos are much lower energy, so stopping them doesn't affect these bands.

Wait, that would mean that the flux in band1 and band2 remains the same as before the pp-III stopped. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would stay the same as before.

But wait, the question states that the pp-III process stopped. If the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 are from B-8, which is unaffected, then the ratio wouldn't change. So the ratio would be the same as before.

But the question is asking for the ratio after the pp-III stopped. So maybe the ratio is the same as before, which I think is around 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process contributes a small amount to the higher energy bands as well, but I doubt it.

Wait, another angle: the flux from the Sun is a combination of all neutrino sources. If a major source (like pp-III) stops, but the other sources remain, the overall flux is reduced by the contribution of pp-III.

But the question is about specific energy bands, not the total flux. So if the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to these bands, then the ratio remains the same.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the pp-III neutrinos are around 10 keV, so the bands in question are way above that. So their fluxes are from B-8. So the ratio would be the same as before.

But I'm not sure what the ratio is. The B-8 neutrino flux spectrum has a peak, I think, around 5-6 MeV, and it decreases with higher energy. So the flux in 0.7-0.9 MeV would be much lower than at higher energies.

Wait, no, that's the other way around. In the B-8 decay, the neutrinos are emitted with a spectrum that peaks at a certain energy, and the flux decreases above that peak. For example, if the peak is at 5 MeV, then the 0.7 MeV band would have much fewer neutrinos than higher bands.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.7 MeV is way below the peak. So the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would be much lower than in band 2 (800-900 keV) if the peak is higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum from B-8 decay. The B-8 has a half-life of about 19 seconds, and when it decays, it emits a neutrino. The energy spectrum for the neutrino is given by the decay process: B-8 → He-4 + e+ + ν_e. The neutrino energies can range up to about 15.5 MeV (but most are much lower).

The spectrum is such that the number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy. So higher energy neutrinos are less numerous. So the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV band (band 1) would be higher than the flux in the 0.9-1.1 MeV band (if there were such a band), and so on. So band 1 would have a higher flux than band 2.

Wait, but the question is comparing 700-800 and 800-900. So band 1 is 700-800 (0.7-0.8 MeV), band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV. Since the neutrino flux decreases with energy, the flux in band1 is higher than band2. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) is greater than 1.

Wait, but in reality, the neutrino flux from B-8 is much higher at lower energies within its spectrum. So in the 0.7 MeV range, the flux would be higher than at 0.8 MeV, making the flux1 higher than flux2, so ratio >1. But the options don't have a ratio higher than 1 except option A (10), which is 10.

But earlier, I thought that the ratio depends on whether the pp-III process contributes to these bands. But since the pp-III neutrinos are way lower energy, stopping them doesn't affect bands 1 and 2. So the ratio remains the same, which would be the same as what it was before the pp-III stopped.

Wait, but the question says to consider the ratio after the pp-III stopped. If pp-III did contribute to these bands, then the ratio would change, but if not, it stays the same.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III process contributes to another part of the spectrum, and the bands in question are dominated by B-8. So the ratio would be about the same.

Wait, but in the previous reasoning, the B-8 spectrum's flux is higher in lower energy bands. So for band1 (0.7-0.8) and band2 (0.8-0.9), the flux in band1 is higher, making the ratio about 1 or a bit higher. But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: solar neutrino experiments like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) measured the total flux and found that the total neutrino flux is about 60% of the predicted rate, supporting neutrino oscillations. But that's about the total, not specific bands.

But for the specific energy bands, the pp-III neutrinos are in much lower energy, so their stopping doesn't affect bands 1 and 2. Hence, the flux ratio remains as it was.

But what was the original ratio? The B-8 neutrinos have their flux peaking at around 5-6 MeV. So their flux decreases with increasing energy. So the flux at 0.7 MeV is higher than at 0.8, higher than at 0.9.

Wait, that's not correct. Because 0.7 MeV is much lower than the peak. Wait, no, it's the opposite. The neutrino energy spectrum from B-8 has a peak around 5 MeV, so lower energies (closer to the Q-value) would have higher flux. So in the 0.7 MeV band, the flux would be higher than in the 0.8 MeV band, which would be higher than in 0.9 MeV. Therefore, flux1 > flux2, so ratio >1.

If the ratio is about 10, then option A is correct. But that would require a significant drop from 0.7 to 0.8 MeV. Alternatively, perhaps the flux drops by a factor of 10 per 0.1 MeV as you go up, but I don't know the actual data.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is nearly flat in that region. But without specific data, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III process produces neutrinos with energies around a few keV. The B-8 neutrinos have a much broader spectrum, but the majority are in higher energies. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are in the lower end of the B-8 neutrino spectrum.

So if the pp-III process stops, but the B-8 neutrinos are unaffected, the ratio of band1 to band2 would remain the same as before.

But what is the ratio? If the neutrino spectrum falls off quickly with energy, the ratio could be 10, option A. If it's a gentle slope, the ratio could be closer to 1.

But in reality, the flux in 0.7-0.8 MeV would be higher than 0.8-0.9 MeV. So the ratio is greater than 1.

Looking at the options, only option A is greater than 1 (10), and option C is 1.

But wait, if the neutrino spectrum's flux drops by a factor of 10 when you go from 0.7 to 0.8 MeV, then the ratio would be 10. But I'm not sure if the drop is that steep.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in band1 is about the same as band2, making the ratio 1 (option C). But I thought the flux drops.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino spectrum is such that the flux is roughly similar in these two bands. So the ratio is approximately 1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, let's think about the number of events in these bands. Since the B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum that extends into the MeV range, but the majority are at higher energies, the flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV would be higher than in 0.8-0.9 MeV. So the ratio would be greater than 1.

But without knowing the exact distribution, I can't be precise. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, considering that neutrinos from the pp-III branch stopped, but the question is about flux in bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV. If the neutrinos from pp-III were in these bands, then their stopping would cause a drop in flux. But since pp-III neutrinos are at around 10 keV, then they don't contribute to these bands. So the flux in these bands remains the same, so the ratio remains same.

But the question is, what is the ratio now that pp-III stopped. So if the neutrinos in these bands are unaffected, then the ratio is the same as before, which I don't know.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it in another way. The question says that the pp-III branch stops. The pp-III process produces a certain number of neutrinos. The total neutrino flux is the sum of all sources.

So if the pp-III stops, the total flux would decrease by the amount the pp-III contributed. But the question is about specific bands.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in a different energy range than the two bands, then the flux in these bands doesn't change. So the ratio remains the same.

But if the pp-III process contributes neutrinos to these bands, then stopping it would lower the flux in those bands.

In that case, the ratio would change. But I think the pp-III neutrinos are way too low energy to be in these bands.

So, the ratio remains the same as before. But I don't know what the initial ratio was.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III process contributes neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. Then, stopping it would reduce the flux in these bands. But earlier calculations suggested the pp-III neutrinos are around 10 keV. So that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the Q-value for the pp-III process.

Wait, the correct reaction is He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2p + 2ν. The mass of He-3 is about 2.99 amu. Wait, no, He-3 has a mass of about 3.016 amu. Two He-3: 6.032 amu.

He-4 is 4.0026 amu. Two protons: 2.014 amu. So total product mass: 4.0026 + 2.014 = 6.0166 amu. So initial mass of reactants: 6.032 amu.

The mass difference is 6.032 -6.0166= 0.0154 amu. Multiply by 931 MeV/amu: 0.0154 *931 ≈14.37 MeV.

So the Q-value is ~14.37 MeV. So the total energy available is 14.37 MeV. This goes into the kinetic energy of the two protons and the two neutrinos.

The protons are much more massive (~1 amu each) than the neutrinos (which are nearly massless). So the protons will carry away most of the energy, leaving the neutrinos with a small fraction.

The protons, each with a rest mass of ~938 MeV, have a combined rest mass of ~1876 MeV. The available energy is 14.37 MeV, so the protons' kinetic energy would be roughly 14.37 MeV (since their rest mass is much larger, the kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass. So KE_p ~ 14.37 MeV /2 = 7.185 MeV each.

Wait, no, that's not right. The total energy available is 14.37 MeV. The protons' kinetic energy plus the neutrinos' energy equals 14.37 MeV.

But since neutrinos are massless, their energy is their kinetic energy. The protons are much more massive, so their kinetic energy would be much smaller compared to their rest mass. So the neutrinos carry away most of the Q-value.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately. The energy distribution between the protons and neutrinos.

The initial total energy is all rest mass energy, and the Q-value is the kinetic energy released. So the kinetic energy (K) is 14.37 MeV.

Each proton has rest energy E_rest = m_p c² ≈938 MeV. So for two protons, 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

The initial total energy is 6.032 amu → 6.032 *931≈5618 MeV.

The final energy is 6.0166 amu →6.0166 *931≈5609.3 MeV.

The kinetic energy is 5618 -5609.3 ≈10.7 MeV? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused between mass and energy.

Alternatively, the Q-value is the difference in rest mass energy. So 0.0154 amu → 14.37 MeV. So the total kinetic energy of products is 14.37 MeV.

So the two protons and two neutrinos share 14.37 MeV.

Assuming the protons share most of this, but each has a rest mass of 938 MeV. So their kinetic energy is much smaller compared to their rest mass. So the neutrinos would carry away most of the Q-value.

Wait, but neutrinos are emitted, so their energy would be a significant fraction of the Q-value.

Let me model it. The energy available is 14.37 MeV.

Let E_p be the kinetic energy of each proton, and E_ν the energy of each neutrino.

Assuming that the protons are non-relativistic, their kinetic energy is small compared to their rest mass. So the total kinetic energy of the two protons is 2 E_p.

The neutrinos would carry away the rest: 14.37 - 2 E_p.

But since the protons are non-relativistic, their kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass, so 2 E_p << 14.37, so the neutrinos take almost all the Q-value.

So each neutrino would have an energy of approximately 14.37 MeV / 2 = 7.185 MeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the neutrinos very high energy, but I thought the pp-III neutrinos are low energy. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, no, if the protons are non-relativistic, their kinetic energy would be small, so the neutrinos take almost all the Q-value. So each neutrino carries away about 7 MeV.

But earlier, I thought the pp-III neutrinos were low energy. So where is the mistake?

Ah, perhaps I mixed up the reaction. Wait, another possibility is that the neutrinos are emitted in the pp-I branch, not the pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are actually high energy, but the majority of the solar neutrinos come from B-8, which are even higher.

So if the pp-III neutrinos are around 7 MeV each, then the bands in the question (700-800 and 800-900 keV) are in the same ballpark as the pp-III neutrinos.

Wait, that would mean that the pp-III neutrinos are in the same energy range as the two bands. So if the pp-III process stops, the flux in these bands would drop.

So if the pp-III neutrinos contribute significantly to the flux in band1 (700-800 keV) and band2 (800-900 keV), then stopping them would reduce the flux in these bands.

But earlier calculation suggested each neutrino from pp-III would have about 7 MeV. So they're in the 7 MeV range, which is much higher than the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands.

Hmm, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to summarize.

If the pp-III neutrinos are around 7 MeV, then the bands in the question (0.7-0.9 MeV) are way lower, so their flux isn't affected. So the ratio remains the same.

But if the pp-III neutrinos are around 0.7 MeV, then their stopping would reduce the flux in band1 (700-800 keV) more than band2 (800-900 keV), making the ratio lower.

But earlier calculations suggested the pp-III neutrinos are about 7 MeV, so the bands aren't affected.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the pp-III reaction: He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2p + 2ν.

The mass of He-3 is 3.016 amu. Two He-3: 6.032 amu.

He-4 is 4.0026 amu. Two protons: 2.014 amu. So total product mass: 4.0026 + 2.014 =6.0166 amu.

The mass difference is 6.032 -6.0166 =0.0154 amu. 0.0154 *931 ≈14.37 MeV.

So the Q-value is 14.37 MeV. So the two neutrinos take away some energy, and the protons take the rest.

Assuming the protons are non-relativistic, their kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass. So the neutrinos carry away almost all the Q-value, about 14.37 MeV. So each ν would have about 7.185 MeV.

So their energies are about 7 MeV each. So their flux is in the 7 MeV range, which is way higher than the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands in the question.

So the bands in the question (0.7-0.9 MeV) are much lower than the neutrinos from pp-III. So the pp-III stop doesn't affect the flux in these bands. So the ratio remains the same.

But then, what is the ratio of flux in band1 to band2?

The neutrino spectrum from B-8 (the main source) has a peak around 5-6 MeV, and the flux decreases with higher energy. So the flux in lower energies (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be lower than at higher energies (0.8-0.9).

Wait, that's the opposite. Because if the spectrum peaks at 5 MeV, the flux at 0.7 MeV would be much lower than at 5 MeV. But within the lower energy range, does the flux increase or decrease with energy?

Wait, the neutrino spectrum from B-8 decay is a spectrum where the number of neutrinos per unit energy decreases as energy increases beyond the mean energy.

Wait, for B-8 decay, the neutrino energy spectrum is given by a function, usually approximated as a sum of Gaussian distributions. The average neutrino energy is around 5-6 MeV, and the spectrum extends up to about 15.5 MeV.

So at 0.7 MeV, the neutrino flux would be very low, but as you go higher in energy, the flux would increase until the peak and then decrease.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The flux increases with energy up to the peak and then decreases. So between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV, which is below the peak, the flux would be increasing with energy. So the flux in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be higher than in 0.7-0.8 MeV.

Thus, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be less than 1.

Wait, but if the neutrino spectrum is increasing from 0.7 to 0.9 MeV, then band2 would have higher flux than band1. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would be less than 1.

But if the pp-III neutrinos are at 7 MeV, stopping them doesn't affect bands 1 and 2.

So the ratio is determined by the B-8 neutrino spectrum. So in the B-8 spectrum, the flux increases with energy up to the peak. So band2 (higher energy) has higher flux than band1. So the ratio is less than 1.

So the options are B:0.01, D:0.1.

But what is the actual ratio? The flux ratio depends on how the B-8 neutrino spectrum behaves between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV.

If the spectrum is rising, the ratio is less than 1.

If it's roughly flat, the ratio is close to 1.

I think the neutrino flux from B-8 is so low at 0.7 MeV that it's negligible. But perhaps between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV, the flux increases.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. However, considering that option D is 0.1, which is a ratio of 1:10, which seems plausible if the flux increases a factor of 10 between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the flux doesn't change much, making the ratio about 1.

But earlier reasoning suggests the ratio is less than 1. So the options are B or D.

But the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. If the pp-III neutrinos were not contributing to these bands, then the ratio remains as per the B-8 neutrinos.

Wait, but the pp-III neutrinos are at 7 MeV, which is higher than the bands. So the pp-III stop doesn't affect the bands. So the ratio is determined solely by B-8.

So the ratio is flux1/flux2 = less than 1.

The options are B (0.01) and D (0.1).

But without exact data, I have to guess. I think the correct answer is B)0.01.

Wait, no, that can't be right. The neutrino flux at 0.7 MeV is very low, but I'm not sure it's that much lower than 0.8 MeV.

Alternatively, considering that the flux from B-8 is much higher at higher energies, perhaps the ratio is about 0.1.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about the relative contributions of B-8 and pp-III to the total neutrino flux.

The pp-III process contributes a small fraction to the total neutrino flux. So the total neutrino flux would drop by a few percent if pp-III stops. But the question is about specific bands.

But the B-8 neutrinos contribute the majority of the neutrino flux in the MeV range. So the bands in question are dominated by B-8. So the ratio is determined by the B-8 spectrum.

But without knowing the exact spectrum, perhaps the best assumption is that the flux in band1 and band2 is roughly similar, making the ratio close to 1.

But earlier reasoning suggested that the flux increases with energy, so band2 has higher flux than band1, making the ratio less than one.

If the ratio is around 0.1, that would be option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is about 1, making option C correct.

But I'm a bit stuck. Given the options, and considering the flux in band2 is higher than band1, the ratio is less than 1. So the options are B or D.

If the ratio is about 0.1, then the answer is D.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the pp-III neutrinos are in the ~7 MeV range, so their stopping doesn't affect the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands.

The B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors. The flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV band is much lower than at higher energies, but perhaps not by an order of magnitude.

So the ratio could be approximately 1, making option C correct.

But earlier, I thought that the flux increases with energy in the lower MeV range, leading to a ratio less than 1.

I'm really not sure. Since I'm time-constrained, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given that the neutrino flux increases with energy up to the peak, the ratio is less than 1. So the options are B or D.

If the flux increases by a factor of 10 between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV, the ratio is 0.1 (option D). If it increases by a smaller factor, the ratio is higher.

But without knowing the exact spectrum, perhaps the ratio is about 0.1, so option D.

Alternatively, if the flux doesn't change much, the ratio is about 1 (option C).

Hmm, I'm going to go with option D: 0.1.

The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the ratio of neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch produces neutrinos through the reaction \( \text{He-3} + \text{He-3} \to \text{He-4} + 2p + 2\nu \), with a Q-value of approximately 14.37 MeV. This energy is shared between the two protons and two neutrinos, with the neutrinos carrying a significant fraction of the energy. Calculations suggest that each neutrino from the pp-III process has an energy of approximately 7 MeV, placing them well above the energy range of the two bands in question (0.7-0.9 MeV).

The neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands primarily originate from the decay of \( \text{B-8} \), a product of the pp-I branch, which is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch. The \( \text{B-8} \) neutrino spectrum peaks around 5-6 MeV and decreases at higher energies. Below the peak, the flux increases with energy. Therefore, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is expected to be higher than in band 1 (700-800 keV), leading to a ratio \( \text{flux(band 1)} / \text{flux(band 2)} < 1 \).

The stoppage of the pp-III branch does not affect these bands, as the pp-III neutrinos are in a much higher energy range. Thus, the ratio is determined solely by the \( \text{B-8} \) neutrino spectrum. Given the increasing nature of the flux with energy in the lower MeV range, the ratio is likely less than 1. Among the options, \( 0.1 \) (option D) is the most plausible, as it reflects a reasonable decrease in flux from band 1 to band 2.

Answer: D
