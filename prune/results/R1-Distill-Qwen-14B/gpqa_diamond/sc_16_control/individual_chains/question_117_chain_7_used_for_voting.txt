Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are called enantiomers, and they can rotate plane-polarized light. So, the question is asking which of the given organic moieties exhibit this property.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, the structure is a biphenyl with two substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 and 6' and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1'. Now, I'm trying to visualize this. The key here is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers.

Wait, in biphenyl systems, if the substituents are on adjacent positions, maybe it's more likely to be chiral. Let me think. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then there could be stereoisomerism. For example, if the groups on each ring are in such positions that they can't be mirrored by each other. So in this case, with nitro and carboxylate groups on each ring... Let me draw it mentally. 6 and 6' are across from each other on each ring, and 2 and 2' are ortho to the connecting bond. Wait, but the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', so the substituents at 2 and 2' are on the adjacent positions. So, the structure is like two benzene rings connected, each with a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has two substituents. Are these substituents arranged symmetrically? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two substituents (nitro and carboxylate) on each benzene ring are at positions that are opposite each other (ortho and para), making each ring have a plane of symmetry? Or perhaps the arrangement leads to a chiral center. Wait, but biphenyls themselves can have a type of chirality if the substituents make the molecule non-symmetrical. So, if the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other are not symmetrical when considering the biphenyl axis, then it could lead to enantiomers.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For instance, if you have a mirror plane through the central bond, making the two sides mirror images. If that's the case, then the molecule is achiral. But if the substituents are arranged such that no such plane exists, then it's chiral. So I'm a bit stuck on this one. Maybe I should move to the next option and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. So the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but the hydroxyl is on C2. So, structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2OHCH2COOCH3. So, the ester is methyl ester (OCH3), the acid part is propanoate with OH on the second carbon.

So, the structure is:

O
||O
CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no, the propanoate is three carbons. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is:

COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon. The second carbon has an OH group and is connected to the first carbon (CH2). So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a stereogenic center?

The second carbon: let's see. It's connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, CH2-, and a hydrogen? Wait, wait, the second carbon would have four different groups attached. Let's count:

- One OH group
- One CH2COOCH3 (the rest of the chain)
- One CH2- (on the other side)
- And a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Carbons: 1, 2, 3.

1: CH2-

2: C(OH) connected to 1 and 3.

3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, propanoate is three carbons. The structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that would be four carbons if you count the methyl ester. Wait, noâ€”propanoate is three carbons, so the acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would make it CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's four carbons in total, but the acid part is three. So the structure is: the ester is CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3.

Wait, in that molecule, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the second carbon is attached to:

- OH group
- One CH2 group (to the first carbon)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (to the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen? Wait, no, because CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have each CH2 as a methylene group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, no. Let me write it:

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The propanoate part is connected to that. So propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

COOCH3 is on the third carbon. The second carbon has OH, the first and third carbons, and a hydrogen? No, wait, in this structure, each CH2 has two CH2 groups. Wait, the second carbon would have:

- OH
- CH2- (to the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (to the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen? Or is it CH2 with two CH2 groups?

Wait, each CH2 has two H's. So the second carbon has four substituents: two CH2 groups (one on each side), an OH, and a H? No, wait, no. The second carbon in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would be connected to:

- One OH
- One CH2- (the first carbon)
- One COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- And two H's? Wait, no. Because each CH2 is a CH2 group, so each has two H's. Wait, but the second carbon is CH2, so it's attached to two CH2 groups (the first and third), an OH, and a hydrogen? Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, no. Let me write the structure:

The molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- One -CH2-OH (from the first carbon)
- One -CH2-CO-OCH3 (from the third carbon)
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two hydrogens. So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2-OH)
- The third carbon (CH2-COOCH3)
- And two H's.

Wait, but then the second carbon only has two different substituents besides the H's. That would mean it's not a stereogenic center because it doesn't have four different groups. Because it's CH2, not a CH with four different groups. So, wait, in this structure, the second carbon is CH2, so it's (CH2OH) and (CH2COOCH3) and two H's. That's not four different groups, so it can't be a chiral center. So, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps there's another possibility.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure as:

The acid is propanoic acid, with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Its structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, connected to:

- One OH
- One CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

No, so that's only two different substituents besides the two H's. So it's not a stereogenic center. So, no optical isomerism here. So, option 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when there's a hydroxyl group and the possibility of hydrogen bonding, maybe that affects the arrangement. But no, optical activity is about the presence of chiral centers. So, without a chiral center, no optical isomerism. So option 2 doesn't show it.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, right? Two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. So, the structure is Ph-CO-Ph. Now, does this have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl group. So, it's a planar structure. There's no chiral center here. Also, the molecule is symmetrical because the two phenyl groups are identical and attached symmetrically. So, no optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't show it.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but when it loses two water molecules, it becomes maleic anhydride. Wait, fumarate is the same as maleate? No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, and maleate is the cis isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Each end is a COOCH3 group attached to a CH group, and the two CH groups are connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2=CH with each CH attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans-dioic acid, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the ester would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

But wait, in terms of stereoisomerism, fumaric acid has two stereoisomers: the cis (which would be maleic acid) and the trans (fumaric). But wait no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, so fumarate is the trans. But wait, when you esterify fumarate, you get dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans-diestereomer.

But does this molecule have any stereocenters? No, because the double bond is between two CH groups, which are each attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, for each CH group, are they attached to the same substituents?

Wait, each CH in CH=CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's? No, because each CH is connected to one COOCH3, another COOCH3 (across the double bond?), and then two H's? Wait, no. Let's think. Each CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group on the same side,
- One COOCH3 group on the opposite side? No, wait. If the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

So each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3, and two H's. Wait, but that can't be right because that would make each carbon CH2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, fumaric acid is trans-di-carboxylic acid. So, its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So when esterified with methanol, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to one COOCH3 group. So, each CH has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One H
- And two bonds to the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3, another COOCH3, and two H's, right? So, each is CH2(COOCH3) on either end. Wait, but that would make each carbon in the double bond have two COOCH3 groups attached, which would make them have the same substituents on both sides. So, perhaps each CH is CH2(COOCH3), but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So, each CH has a COOCH3 and a H. So, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and two other CH's (but wait, it's a double bond, so each CH is connected to one CH on either side via double bond). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

But the key point is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. Because if you have a double bond with identical groups on each carbon and they are trans, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the groups across the double bond are the same and trans, the molecule isn't chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a H, and the double bond is trans. Wait, but if both CH groups have the same substituents, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond axis. So, it's not chiral, right? So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral. Because if you mirror one side, it's the same as the other.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused with another molecule, like meso compounds. Wait, but in this case, the molecule has a central double bond and identical groups on each end, so it's symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism here. So, option 4 doesn't show it either.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, fumarate is actually the trans isomer, which is different from maleate, the cis. But in terms of stereoisomerism, does the double bond lead to any geometric isomerism? Yes, but that's a different kind. But the question is about optical isomerism, which requires a chiral center.

So, in option 4, dimethyl fumarate, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a H. But if the substituents on each CH are the same, then each CH isn't a chiral center. Wait, each CH has two COOCH3 groups? No, each CH has one COOCH3 and one H. So, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two CH's (but that's part of the double bond, so they are each connected via double bonds, so each is CH.

Wait, perhaps each CH has:

- One COOCH3
- One H
- Two double bonds (so the other two substituents are the adjacent carbons via the double bond). So, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and two CH groups. But wait, that's not possible because each CH is only connected to two substituents besides the double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. If each CH group isn't a chiral center, then the molecule can't have optical isomers. So, if both CHs are identical and symmetrical, then no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So, option 4 doesn't show it.

Wait, but wait again. What about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry? For example, if it's symmetrical around the double bond, then it's not chiral. Which would mean no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap the options.

Option 1: The first compound is a biphenyl derivative with substituents on each ring. Are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral?

In biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that don't allow a plane of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that can't be mirrored, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

So, in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are nitro at 6 and 6', and carboxylate at 2 and 2' on each ring. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring has two substituents: one nitro and one carboxylate. The positions are 6 and 2 on each ring.

Wait, the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', so the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions. Are these positions symmetrical with respect to the central bond?

Wait, for a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other (since 1 is the connected position). So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, in each ring, the substituents are at positions ortho and para to the biphenyl connection. Wait, no. If the biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1', then the substituent at 2 is ortho to the connecting bond, and the substituent at 6 is meta? Or wait, benzene rings are numbered such that position 1 is the connecting point. So, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond.

So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other? Because from position 1, going clockwise, position 2 is next, but position 6 is across. Wait, perhaps on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent. So, each ring has two substituents adjacent to the connecting position.

Wait, but if each ring has two substituents in the same relative positions, would that make the entire molecule symmetrical?

Hmm, perhaps. If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1. So, each substituent is on the same side as the other ring's substituents? Or no.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. So, if the substituents are arranged in a way that when you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, the substituents swap places, then the molecule is symmetrical and hence not chiral.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. Alternatively, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, let me think again about the substituents. Each ring has a nitro (NO2) at position 6 and a carboxylate (COOCH3) at position 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are both ortho to the connecting bond. Now, would the arrangement of these substituents on each ring cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral?

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make each ring symmetrical, then the entire molecule could be symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in positions that are symmetric with respect to the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on the two rings are not mirrored, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents, but their positions relative to each other could differ. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making the substituents mirror images. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral. But if they're not, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they are in the same relative positions, making the molecule symmetrical. So, for each ring, the nitro is on one side and the carboxylate on the other, but when viewed from the other ring, they mirror each other. So, the molecule's substituents are arranged symmetrically, meaning it's achiral.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe I should look for another approach. Another way to think about it: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that when you draw a plane through the central bond, each substituent on the left ring has a mirror counterpart on the right ring, then the molecule is achiral. So, for example, if each ring has a nitro group on the same side relative to the connecting bond, and the same for the carboxylate, then the molecule is symmetrical. But if the substituents on each ring are on opposite sides, then perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has both a nitro and a carboxylate, which are different groups. So, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that each has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their positions relative to each other are fixed, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any symmetry because the substituents on each ring are in different positions, leading to no plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of another way. Are there any other factors that make a molecule chiral? For example, the presence of a chiral center or a chiral axis.

Wait, in biphenyls, the molecule can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral and can exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, each ring has two substituents: nitro and carboxylate. Since these are different groups, their arrangement on each ring could create a chiral environment for the entire molecule.

So, perhaps option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, to recap:

Option 1: Possibly chiral, so exhibits optical isomerism.

Option 2: No chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Option 3: Symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

Option 4: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 might have a double bond but without any chiral centers. So, no.

So, which options show optical isomerism? Only option 1.

Wait, but looking back at the question, the options given are:

Option A: 1,2,4

Option B: 3,4

Option C: 2,3

Option D:1,2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only option 1 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options have only 1 as the correct answer. Wait, no, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me reevaluate each option.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Are these substituents arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry? If the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. But if not, then no. Since each ring has the same substituents, but their positions relative to each other may create a chiral environment.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry because the substituents are in positions that can't be mirrored. So, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, option 1: yes.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate this. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, perhaps the central carbon (the second carbon) is a chiral center. Let me check again.

The second carbon is connected to:

- OH group
- CH2COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- CH2- (the first carbon)
- And one H.

Wait, no, because in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a H. So it's CH2-OH, CH2-CH2-COOCH3, and two H's. So, the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

Wait, but that's only three substituents. No, wait, each CH2 has two H's. So, the second carbon has:

Two H's,

One OH,

One CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's three substituents. So, the second carbon: what groups are attached? It's a CH2 group, so it's CH2-OH, CH2-COOCH3, and two H's. But wait, CH2 groups have two H's. So, the substituents on the second carbon are:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

Wait, so that's not four different substituents. So, no chiral center here. So, option 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's a chiral center. Let me double-check.

The formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the middle carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, as before, no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, none of the options have only 1 as correct. Because the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, so if only option 1 is correct, but none of the options say that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Earlier, I thought that the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me think again.

Fumarate is the trans isomer of the di-carboxylic acid. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3? Or is it (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond in between. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans form, so it's (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond.

But in this structure, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a H. So each CH would have two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and two CH's (but those are connected via double bonds, so they're not substituents).

Wait, but each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and two CH groups via double bond. So, each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each CH is a CH group. So, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two CH groups (but those are part of the double bond, so they are not substituents in the same way).

Wait, but in terms of substituents, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- H
- And two CH's via double bonds, which are part of the same molecule.

But for a chiral center, the four substituents must be different. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two CH's connected via double bonds.

Wait, but the two CH's are part of the same double bond, so perhaps they are not considered different substituents. So, each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and two identical substituents (the adjacent CH groups). So, each CH is connected to two identical substituents (the CH's), so they are not chiral centers.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, each CH is not a chiral center, so the molecule doesn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. Another possibility: the molecule has a plane of symmetry. In trans-dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it's not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, only option 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, none of them have only option 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, maybe I missed option 4. Let's think again.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. So, each CH has a COOCH3 and a H. Are these substituents arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical? If so, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so that brings me back to option 1 being the only one that exhibits optical isomerism. But in the given options, none of the options have only option 1 selected. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2 and 4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 2. Maybe option 2 does have a chiral center. Let me recheck.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

Wait, but if the structure is actually 2-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe it's (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH2OH? No, that would be a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, that would make the second carbon a chiral center.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the structure is propanoate where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, let me clarify the structure. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2, which is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So, only three substituents, meaning it's not a chiral center.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (the second carbon) would be connected to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another H.

Wait, that would make it a chiral center because all four substituents are different.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, perhaps the correct IUPAC name would lead to a different structure.

Wait, in propanoic acid, the carboxylic acid group is on C1. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it becomes the methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So, that's three substituents; no chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)CO-O-CH2CH2OH.

No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. Because the hydroxyl is on the third carbon. So, that would make the second carbon a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2, making the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the second carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two H's.

So, again, only three substituents; no chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: the presence of a chiral center. If a molecule has any chiral centers, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, looking back, I think only option 1 has a chiral center, but according to the options given, none of them have only option 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond. Does that lead to any stereoisomerism, or is that geometric isomerism? Because the question is about optical isomerism, which is a form of stereoisomerism. So, perhaps the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism because it doesn't have a chiral center, but it does have geometric isomerism.

So, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or a chiral axis. So, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, with that, only option 1 would have optical isomerism. But again, the options don't include an option where only 1 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1's analysis. Let me try to imagine the structure again.

The molecule is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1 and 1').

If the substituents are in such positions that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, relative to the connecting bond, but that creates a chiral arrangement. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso, which is achiral despite having stereocenters. But in this case, I'm not sure if any stereocenters exist.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl itself is chiral. Biphenyls can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that prevents a plane of symmetry. So, if each ring has substituents that are not mirror images across the central bond, the molecule is chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in positions that may not mirror each other. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, if option 1 is correct and option 4 is not, then the only correct option is 1. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again: option A is 1,2,4. Option D is 1 and 2. Wait, perhaps I missed another possibility.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds are capable of having enantiomers?

1. Biphenyl derivatives: possible.

2. 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, as discussed.

3. Benzophenone: no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no.

So, only option 1 is correct. But the options don't have an option with only 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 2's structure. Let me imagine option 2 again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (R)- or (S)-configured, making it a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH2OH, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. So, perhaps the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which, as discussed, has no chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. The question is which moieties show optical isomerism. So, perhaps another approach: which of these have a chiral center.

Option 1: Yes.

Option 2: No.

Option 3: No.

Option 4: No.

So, only option 1.

But the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1's analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another possibility. Maybe option 4 has a different structure.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. So, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not correct. Wait, no, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3?

No, wait, (E)-fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Esterified with methanol, it's (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides.

So, the molecule is symmetrical across the central double bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only option 1 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps another way: which options are correct?

Looking at the options, option A says 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, only 1 is correct.

Alternatively, option D says 1 and 2. If option 2 is correct, then perhaps I was wrong about it.

Wait, perhaps in option 2, the structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH(CH2OH)2? No, that's not 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH(OH)CH3, which would have a chiral center.

Wait, wait a second. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the second carbon) would have four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that would make it a chiral center.

But that's 2-hydroxypropanoate, right? Because the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, that can't be right because propanoate is three carbons. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3, then the second carbon is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups
- COOCH3
- OH

So, that would have two CH3 groups, which are the same, making the four substituents: CH3, CH3, COOCH3, OH. So, two substituents are the same, so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH2, which isn't a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should conclude that only option 1 is correct, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, making it symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only option 1. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. Because perhaps option 2 has a chiral center and option 4 doesn't.

But earlier analysis suggests option 2 doesn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another possibility. Let me think about each option again.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The molecule has a biphenyl core. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If these substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

So, this would exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

No chiral center; no optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone.

Symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

No chiral center; no optical isomerism.

So, only option 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But the given options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. Perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only option 1 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in option 2.

Wait, perhaps option 2 has a chiral center. Let's imagine that the structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH(OH)CH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the one attached to the oxygen) would have:

- Two CH3 groups
- COOCH3
- OH.

So, three substituents, which isn't a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on a different carbon. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the second carbon is a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I have to choose that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or other features that allow for non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Optical isomerism occurs when a compound lacks a plane of symmetry and has at least one chiral center or a chiral axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl derivative with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. The biphenyl system can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that prevents a plane of symmetry. Since the substituents on each ring are not mirrored across the central bond, the molecule lacks symmetry and is chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is a CH2 group, meaning it has two hydrogens, one hydroxyl group, and one CH2COOCH3 group. A chiral center requires four different substituents, which is not the case here. Thus, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups and the planar carbonyl group. There are no chiral centers or other features that would allow for optical isomerism. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, with identical groups (COOCH3) on either side. Since there are no chiral centers and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, only **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate** (option 1) exhibits optical isomerism. None of the other options show optical isomerism. However, the provided answer choices do not include an option where only 1 is correct. Given the constraints of the options, the best choice is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, assuming a potential error in the analysis of options 2 or 4.
