Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just subtract them normally because of the effects of special relativity. Oh right, I need to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

Wait, velocity addition formula. Right, when you have two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame, the speed of one as seen from the other isn't just u - v. Because that would sometimes give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. So the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me make sure I remember that correctly. So, for u and v in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Wait, but when calculating the relative speed, which one's perspective are we taking? Oh, wait—if I want the relative speed of B as seen from A, then u is 0.6c (since that's A's speed in the rest frame), and v is 0.5c (B's speed in the rest frame). Or is it the other way around? No, wait, if I want the speed of B as seen from A, I should consider A's frame. So in the rest frame of A, B is moving at speed v_rel, which would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Oh, looking at the options, that's either B or C or D. So the relative speed is around 0.14c.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, I need to calculate their gamma factor and then multiply by their respective masses and c².

Let me compute for astronaut A first: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for A: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, gamma is per unit mass? No, gamma is for the mass. So E = gamma * m c². So for A, it's 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Wait, wait, no: wait, 2m multiplied by 1.25 is 2.5m. So E_A is 2.5 m c².

Now astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for B: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. Let me calculate it exactly: sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Hmm, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So that would match option C, which says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity. Wait, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction in the rest frame. So when calculating the relative velocity from one to the other, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is the speed of A, v is the speed of B? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, in the rest frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed? So we have to calculate the velocity of B in A's frame. Let me think: if the rest frame (S) has A moving at u = 0.6c and B moving at v = 0.5c, then the velocity of B as seen from A's frame (S') would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no: the formula for transforming velocities from S to S' is u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, let me get the formula right. The standard velocity addition formula is u’ = (u – v) / (1 – (u v)/(c²)). So u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, v is the velocity of the original frame (S) as seen from S'.

Wait, no, more accurately, if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, the rest frame S is the lab frame, where A is moving at u=0.6c, and B is moving at v=0.5c. So to find the velocity of B in A's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity u_A = 0.6c relative to S, we plug u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c into the formula. So u’ = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative if we're talking about magnitude. Wait, but direction matters. Since B is moving slower than A, from A's perspective, B is moving backward? No, that can't be right. Both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame. So if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, then in A's frame, B is moving slower. So from A's perspective, B would appear to be moving in the opposite direction? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I got the formula backward.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the relative velocity of B with respect to A. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)). Wait, is that correct? Because when the velocities are in the same direction, the denominator might have a plus instead of a minus. Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, to clarify, the correct formula for relative velocity when both are in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but wait, let me think of a scenario. Let's say u and v are both in the same direction, so the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)) only if u and v are in the same direction. Wait, no, perhaps the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), regardless of direction. Wait, but in that case, if u and v are the same, you get zero, which is correct.

Wait, let's take an example where u is 0.8c and v is 0.6c. So the relative speed would be (0.8c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.8c*0.6c)/(c²)) = (0.2c)/(1 - 0.48) = 0.2c / 0.52 ≈ 0.3846c.

Hmm, does that make sense? Because if you're moving at 0.8c and another at 0.6c in the same direction, the relative speed should be 0.2c, but when you apply the formula, it's higher than that. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in classical mechanics, it would be 0.2c, but relativistically, the relative speed is higher than that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if someone is moving at 0.6c, and another at 0.8c in the same direction, from the perspective of the 0.8c observer, the other is moving at (0.8 -0.6)/(1 - (0.8*0.6)) c = (0.2)/(0.52) c ≈ 0.3846c. So that's right. So that's correct. So the formula is correct.

So going back to the original problem, the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) ) → 0.1c/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = approx 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c. So that matches option C's relative speed.

So the relative speed is around 0.14c.

Now, the total energy. Let me recalculate the energies more accurately. For astronaut A, E = gamma * m_rest * c².

So for A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.154700538.

E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² = 1.1547 *3m c² = 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that's the correct option.

Other options: Option B has E=4.96, which is much lower. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower than our calculated 5.96. So option C seems to be the right choice.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds \( u \) and \( v \) in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of astronaut A), \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of astronaut B), and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.

#### Energy of Astronaut A
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### Energy of Astronaut B
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
