Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's something like benzene but with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, like a strong peak around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that makes me think the compound has an ester functional group attached to the aromatic ring.

The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me break down what each part means. The aromatic-H part: two signals. So the benzene ring must have two different types of aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents are probably in positions that cause the ring protons to split into two sets. For example, in para substitution, the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent to each substituent, but wait, di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. Hmm. But if there are two signals, that would imply two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Wait, in para substitution, if the substituents are identical, then the ring would have two equivalent protons on each side, but that would actually be one set for each pair. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. For para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the ring protons would be in two sets: those adjacent to each substituent (ortho) and those meta to them. Wait, but in para substitution with two substituents, maybe the ring protons are all equivalent? No, that's only if the substituents are in a way that creates symmetry. Hmm, maybe it's an ortho substitution, which would cause more splitting.

Wait, but then the aromatic protons are two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two types of protons. Like maybe one substituent is in position 1 and another in position 3, making it a meta substitution. No, wait, in that case, the ring might have even more splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two equivalent protons each, but split into two signals. Maybe they're in a para arrangement, but with different substituents leading to two different sets.

Wait, the problem says it's di-substituted, so two substituents. Let me think of an example: perhaps an ester group and another group attached to the ring.

So in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two signals. That suggests two distinct sets. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, but they are different, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons. Because if they were the same substituent in para, the ring would have equivalent protons, leading to a single aromatic peak. But since the substituents are different, the ring protons might not be equivalent, leading to two signals. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. Let's park that thought for a moment and look at other parts of the NMR.

Then, there are two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, esters have an oxygen connected to a carbonyl and an oxygen connected to an R group, which could be an alkyl chain. Oh, maybe the ester is part of a substituent on the benzene ring, like an aryl ester or maybe an alkyl ester.

Wait, but the vinyl-H signals are from a double bond. So, perhaps the ester is attached via a vinyl group? Or maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group somewhere else.

Wait, the NMR also shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So two sets of methyl protons. Each of these would be a triplet if they're adjacent to a CH2, but in this case, there are no CH2 signals, so perhaps the CH3 are either attached directly to something else, like oxygen or a carbonyl, or perhaps they're in a structure where they don't have neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. The compound has an aromatic ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Let's imagine the ester is something like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, esters are RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So the structure would be benzene with two substituents, one of which is an ester group (like O-CO-R), and another substituent which is perhaps a vinyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. A vinyl group is a CH2=CH– something. So, in the case of an ester with a vinyl group, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be CH2CH2-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the splitting in the NMR. The vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two neighboring sets of protons. Hmm, perhaps the vinyl group is adjacent to another group. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, the protons on the vinyl group would couple with each other. So, the protons on the CH2 would be split into a doublet of quartets if each is coupling with two different sets of protons, perhaps from adjacent groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Wait, another possibility: the ester is part of a substituent that has a vinyl group attached. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-, but that's not a vinyl. Or maybe O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2- with a double bond, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2– but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate group. Like, the ester is an allyl ester. For example, the substituent could be CH2=CHCOOR, but that's a longer chain. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group. But then, the vinyl group would have protons that are adjacent to each other, leading to coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like this: the benzene ring has two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. The other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2CH2-O- or something else. Wait, but that might not fit the NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, the ester group is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The molecular formula options are given, but I'm not sure which they are. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let's compute for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2

Degrees of Unsat = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=10/2=5.

Option B: C12H14O2 → (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2 → (26 -12)/2=14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → (24 -12)/2=12/2=6.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring has 3 degrees of unsaturation (benzene ring: 3 double bonds equivalent). The ester group has one carbonyl, which is another degree. Then, any other double bonds or rings would add more.

So let's see: benzene ring (3) + ester (1) → 4. If there's a vinyl group, that adds one more (double bond). So total would be 5 degrees of unsaturation. Let's check the options.

Option A: 5. So that matches.

Option B: 6. So that would require another degree.

Option C:7 → would need another two.

Hmm. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring (3), ester (1), and a double bond (vinyl, 1), totaling 5. So option A is 5, which fits.

So, the formula would be C11H14O2. Wait, but let's see the NMR data for more clues.

The NMR shows six signals. Let's think about how many protons each part contributes.

Aromatic protons: two signals. Let's say each is a doublet or something. So, say each set has 2 H each, making four aromatic H. That would be for a di-substituted benzene with two substituents causing four different H? No, wait: for a di-substituted benzene, with two substituents, the number of aromatic protons can vary. For example, in para substitution, you have two sets of two equivalent protons each. So that's two signals. So that's four aromatic H.

Then, the vinyl group: two signals. One is a doublet (integrate to 2 H?), the other a doublet of quartets (maybe 2 H as well). So that's four H from the vinyl groups. Wait, but a vinyl group is CH2-CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH–. So a vinyl group would have two sets of protons: the CH2 and the CH. Wait, but in the NMR, the protons on the double bond (vinyl H) are split into different signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester. So, for example, the structure could be something like benzene with an ester group attached via a vinyl group. Let me think of something like benzene with an ester group that's part of a propenoate. So, for example, the substituent is CH2=CHCOOR.

Wait, but how would that affect the NMR? The CH2=CHCOOR group would have the vinyl protons. Let's think: the CH2 group next to the double bond would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH and perhaps others.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an oxygen, like an ether. For example, O-CH2-CH2-, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The ester group is O-CO-OR, where R is a group that includes a vinyl. So perhaps R is CH2CH2–, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, R could be CH2CH2COO–, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester oxygen. Like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2–, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR signals. There are two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet (maybe a trans coupling), and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, each proton on the double bond is coupling with two different neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like O-CH2-CH2- but that's not a double bond. Or maybe it's an allyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows no CH2 signals, so any CH2 groups must be equivalent or not present. Wait, but the presence of –CH3 groups: two signals, each integrating as –CH3. So perhaps two different methyl groups.

So maybe the ester group is something like O-CO-O-R, where R is a group with two methyl substituents. For example, R could be CH2CH(CH3)2 or similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like CH2=CHCOO– attached to the benzene ring. Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would have protons that are split into different signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2–, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methacrylate group. Methacrylate is CH2=CHCOO–. So, the benzene ring would have an ester substituent like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2–, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, methacrylate is CH2=CHCOO–, so the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2–, but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, the substituent is an allyl ester. The structure would be something like benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2– but that's a single bond. Wait, no, allyl is CH2=CHCH2–. So, maybe the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO– attached to the benzene. Hmm, but that might give rise to certain NMR signals.

But let's think about the number of H in the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester, which could be O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH–).

But then, the vinyl group would have two sets of protons. The CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, which has a double bond. So, the CH2 protons would be split by the adjacent CH protons, and the CH protons would be split by the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to piece together the NMR data.

Aromatic protons: two signals, say n1 and n2. Vinyl protons: two signals, say n3 and n4. Methine groups: perhaps, but no, the question says –CH3 groups. So perhaps two methyl groups are present, each giving a singlet if they're attached to something deshielded, like an oxygen.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals from –CH3 groups. So, for example, two different methyl groups. Maybe one methyl is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester's R group), and another methyl is part of a substituent elsewhere.

Wait, in an ester group, the R group could be a methyl, for example, in methyl benzoate. But in that case, the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. Then, the methyl group would be a singlet in the NMR. But if there's another methyl group elsewhere, that could explain the two signals.

But wait, another substituent could be a vinyl group attached to the ring. For example, the structure could be something like vinylphenyl ester. Wait, but the substituents are two, so perhaps one is the ester and the other is a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and another group that has a methyl group attached.

I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the total number of hydrogens.

The molecular formula possibilities:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option B: C12H14O2 →14 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 →12 H.

So, the compound has either 12 or 14 hydrogens.

The NMR shows six signals. Let's count the expected H from each part.

Aromatic H: two signals, let's say they sum to 4 H (like two doublets, each 2 H). Then vinyl H: two signals, perhaps 2 H each (so 4 H). Then two methyl groups, each 3 H, so 6 H. Total H from these would be 4 +4 +6 =14 H. So that would fit with options A and B, which have 14 H (A is C11H14O2, B is C12H14O2).

Wait, but wait: the aromatic ring has 6 H, but in a di-substituted benzene, the number of H depends on substitution. For example, para substitution would have two sets of 2 H each, so 4 H (which would give two signals), and the other two H on the ring would be ortho to substituents, but wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite, so the ring would have two sets of 2 H each, which is four H. Wait, no, benzene has six H. If substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of 2 H each (ortho to substituents) and two H in the para positions? No, wait, in para substitution, each substituent is at opposite positions, so the ring has two substituents across from each other. So the H adjacent to substituents (ortho) would be equivalent, and the H para to substituents would be equivalent as well. So that would lead to two signals: each with 2 H (ortho) and 2 H (para). Wait no, the substituents are in para positions, so the ortho H would be equivalent, and the meta H would be equivalent as well. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring H are split into two sets. For example, substituents in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), causing the ring to have three distinct H types, but that's more than two signals. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions (para), then the ring would have two sets of H: two H ortho to substituent A, two H meta to substituent A, and two H ortho to substituent B. But that would be more than two signals. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H, so maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the ring H to split into two sets, each integrating to two H. That would mean four H from the ring, and the other two H from substituents. But then, the compound would have more H elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any other H beyond the aromatic, vinyl, and methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents don't have any additional H.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (which doesn't add H) and the other is a methyl group. No, but the NMR shows two methyl signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think of the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH– attached to the ring). Then, the ester group's R could be a methyl group. So the ester would be O-CO-OCH3.

So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 (ortho), one being O-CO-OCH3, and the other being CH2=CH–.

Wait, but the vinyl group would have H on the CH2 and CH. The CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, and perhaps also next to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ether, like O-CH2-CH2–, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate group. For example, the ester would have a CH2=CHCOO– group attached to the ring.

So, structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2–, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, no, in that case, the substituent would be a CH2CH2COO– group, which is a single bond, so no vinyl H. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2=CHCOO– group. So the ester would be attached via the CH2=CHCOO– group. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2–, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's benzene with a substituent that is an allyl ester. So the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2–, but that's a single bond, not a vinyl.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester oxygen. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2–, but that's a single bond.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR again.

The aromatic H are two signals. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. Then, the ring H would be in two sets: two H ortho to each substituent, and two H meta. Wait, but that would give three signals unless the substituents are identical. Wait, but in the case of the substituents being different, the ring would have more than two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring H are split into two signals. Maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group, but then the NMR would show a methyl from the methyl group and another from the ester's R group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals from –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. Let me imagine the structure has two methyl groups attached to the ring. But no, the ring is di-substituted, so only two substituents. So each substituent could have a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester (O-CO-OCH3) and the other substituent is another group that contains a methyl, like a methyl group. But then, the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3 and a CH3. Then, the ring would have substituents in a way that the ring H are split into two signals. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-R), where R is a vinyl group, and the other substituent is a methyl group. Then, the vinyl group would have H that are split into two signals.

Wait, but the vinyl group would have two H: one on each carbon. So in the NMR, each would have a distinct signal due to coupling. For example, in a trans configuration, the H on each carbon would be a doublet.

But then, in the NMR, the vinyl H would be two signals: each is a doublet. But the question says one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is an acrylate ester. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO–. So the substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH2–, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO–. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2–, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, which is connected to an ester. Like the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2–, but that doesn't have a double bond.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the molecular formula again. Let's say the structure is benzene (C6H5) with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R. Let R be a methylene group (CH2) connected to another CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, R could be a vinyl group.

Wait, let's calculate the molecular formula. Suppose the substituents are an ester (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH–). The ester substituent would add O-CO-O-R to the benzene. Let's say R is methyl (CH3), so the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. Then, the other substituent is CH2=CH–, which would add two carbons and three hydrogens (since CH2=CH– is a substituent, connected to the ring, so it's like CH2=CH– attached to the ring). So the substituent is CH2=CH–, but as a substituent, that would add two C and three H (since the ring is bonded to the CH2).

Wait, benzene has 6 C. Each substituent adds some C and H. Let's see:

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3 → that's O-CO-O-CH3. The carbons are: 1 (O-CO-O-) and 1 (CH3), but wait, the O-CO-O is part of the substituent. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 O, 2 C (the carbonyl and the OCH3), and the CH3 adds a C. So for the ester substituent, it adds 2 C (COO and CH3). Wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-O-R. So R is CH3, making the substituent O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 O, 2 C (the COO part), and R is CH3 (another C).

Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, so R is CH3. So the substituent adds 3 O, 2 C (from COO), and 1 C from R. So total 3 C for the substituent.

The other substituent is CH2=CH–. So that's two C and two H (since the ring is attached to the CH2).

So total carbons from substituents: 3 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) = 5 C.

The benzene ring is 6 C. So total C would be 6 +5 = 11 C. But looking at the options, C11 is options A and D, whereas B and C are C12.

So that would suggest the formula is C11 plus whatever else. Let me think about H.

Benzene has 6 H, but each substituent removes one H (since they're attached to the ring). So two substituents would reduce H by 2, so 4 H left on the ring.

The ester substituent (O-CO-OCH3) contributes 3 H (from CH3). The vinyl substituent (CH2=CH–) contributes 3 H (CH2 has 2 H, and CH has 1 H? Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the substituent would have 3 H: the two on CH2 and one on CH. But wait, the CH2 is attached to the ring, so it's like Ar-CH2-CH2–? No, wait, it's Ar-CH2-CH2– but with a double bond. Wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the structure is Ar-CH2-CH2– but the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. So the substituent would be Ar-CH2-CH2–, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: a vinyl substituent would be CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the substituent would be Ar-CH2-CH2–, but that's a single bond. No, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the substituent would be Ar-CH2-CH2– but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's Ar-CH2-CH2– with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the substituent would be Ar-CH2-CH2–, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the substituent is Ar-CH2-CH2– with a double bond between the ring and the first CH2. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is Ar-CH2-CH2– with the double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the substituent is Ar-CH2-CH2–, which is a single bond. So the vinyl group would be part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as an allyl group. An allyl group is CH2=CH-CH2–. So the substituent would be Ar-CH2=CH-CH2–. Then, the substituent adds three C (CH2=CH-CH2–) and has 5 H (the two CH2 groups and the CH in the double bond). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester where R is a vinyl group, like O-CO-CH2-CH2–, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the molecular formula again. If the structure is benzene (C6H5) with two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 (ester with methyl group), and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CH–).

The ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3 adds 3 O, 2 C (COO) + 1 C (CH3) → 3 C. The vinyl substituent: CH2=CH– adds 2 C and 3 H (since CH2 has 2 H and CH has 1 H).

So the total C would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) = 11 C.

The H: benzene has 6 H, but two substituents take two H (so 4 H left on the ring). The ester substituent contributes 3 H (CH3). The vinyl substituent contributes 3 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H). So total H: 4 (ring) +3 (ester) +3 (vinyl) = 10 H. But the options have 12 or 14 H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the ester's R group is a larger group, like ethyl. So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. That adds 3 C (COO and CH2CH3), and contributes 5 H (the ethyl group's 2 H from CH2 and 3 H from CH3). Let's recalculate.

C: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +2 (vinyl) = 11 C.

H: benzene ring has 4 H. Ester substituent contributes 5 H (ethyl group). Vinyl substituent contributes 3 H. Total: 4+5+3=12 H. So the formula would be C11H12O2, which is option D. But wait, the NMR shows six signals, and we have aromatic H (two signals), vinyl H (two signals), and two –CH3 groups (so two signals). So that makes six signals. Let me see:

Aromatic H: two signals (say 2 H each).
Vinyl H: two signals (say 2 H and 1 H? Or 1 H each? Wait, the vinyl group would have two H on the CH2 and one H on the CH, but perhaps they are split into different signals. Alternatively, the structure could have a trans configuration, leading to each H being a doublet.

Wait, but in a vinyl group (CH2=CH–), the CH2 has two H and the CH has one H. So the CH2 H would be a quartet due to coupling with the CH H, and the CH H would be a triplet. But in the NMR, the vinyl H are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe the substituent is part of a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group, like CH2=CHCH2–. Then, the CH2 at the end would have two H, and the middle CH would have two H, but that would require a double bond further along.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to match the options with the NMR.

The NMR shows:

- 2 aromatic H signals → 4 H (so ring has four H, substituents in para positions causing two sets of 2 H each).

- 2 vinyl H signals → perhaps 2 H each, totaling 4 H.

- 2 –CH3 signals → each 3 H, so 6 H.

Total H:4+4+6=14 H. So the molecular formula must have 14 H.

Looking at the options:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H.

B) C12H14O2 → 14 H.

So either A or B is possible.

The degree of unsaturation for A is 5, and for B is6. Earlier, I thought the structure would have degrees of unsaturation 5 (3 from benzene, 1 from ester, 1 from vinyl). So A fits.

So the formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier calculation with substituent O-CO-OCH2CH3 and vinyl gave 12 H, which would be option D. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more carbons. Let me think again: if the substituent is an ester with a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R) where R is a vinyl group, like R = CH2CH2–, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the substituent is a methyl group and an ester group. But then, the vinyl signals wouldn't be present.

I think the correct answer is option A: C11H14O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum showing a strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following key information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, suggesting two distinct sets of aromatic protons. This implies the substituents on the benzene ring are positioned such that the remaining aromatic protons are split into two equivalent sets, likely due to a para substitution pattern with different substituents.

2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) with coupling between the CH₂ and CH protons.

3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups, indicating the presence of two distinct methyl groups in the structure.

4. **No CH₂ signals**: This suggests that any CH₂ groups in the structure are either not present or are in an environment that does not produce a detectable signal in the NMR spectrum.

### Molecular Formula Analysis
The molecular formula options are:
- **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**
- **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**
- **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**
- **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**

#### Degree of Unsaturation
The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Degrees of Unsaturation} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]

- **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂):**
  \[
  \frac{2(11) + 2 - 14}{2} = \frac{24 - 14}{2} = 5
  \]
  This matches the expected degrees of unsaturation for the compound: 3 from the benzene ring, 1 from the ester group, and 1 from the vinyl group.

- **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂):**
  \[
  \frac{2(12) + 2 - 14}{2} = \frac{26 - 14}{2} = 6
  \]
  This would require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not supported by the NMR data.

- **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂):**
  \[
  \frac{2(12) + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{26 - 12}{2} = 7
  \]
  This would require two additional degrees of unsaturation, which is inconsistent with the structure.

- **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):**
  \[
  \frac{2(11) + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{24 - 12}{2} = 6
  \]
  This would also require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not supported by the NMR data.

#### Hydrogen Count
The NMR data indicates a total of 14 hydrogens (4 from aromatic protons, 4 from vinyl protons, and 6 from methyl groups). This matches **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**, which has 14 hydrogens.

### Conclusion
Based on the NMR data, the absence of CH₂ signals, the presence of an ester group, and the molecular formula analysis, the compound is identified as **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**.
