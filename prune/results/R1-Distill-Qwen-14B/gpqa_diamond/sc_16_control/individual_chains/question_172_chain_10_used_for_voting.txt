Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels.

Right, the Boltzmann equation is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait a minute, that number looks familiar. Oh! 1.38 is approximately Boltzmann's constant k (which is about 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * T, maybe? Or wait, ΔE/(k*T) is the exponent. So if T is high, the exponent becomes smaller, meaning more excitation.

Wait, the question says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio of the populations (n_upper to n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe the excitation is the ratio of excited to ground state atoms. Let me clarify: the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is the fraction of atoms in the upper energy level compared to the lower. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But R is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper and g_lower) are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), then the ratio depends only on temperature.

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me see. Let me write R1 = (gU/gL) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = same multiplied by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Given R1 = 2 R2, so R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something. Let's compute ΔE/k: 1.38e-23 / 1.38e-23 = 1. So ΔE/k = 1.

Therefore, ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, let me rearrange that: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2). Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait let me check the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1. No, doesn't fit.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2). That would be similar to 1/T1 +1/T2, which isn't our case.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2. The denominator is squared, which doesn't match.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's correct.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation, which describes the ratio of populations in two energy levels, is central to the analysis:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), where \( R \) is the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state. Assuming the statistical weights \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the same for both stars, the ratio of excitation can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( R_1 / R_2 = 2 \), taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is also \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = T_2 / T_1 \) does not match the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = (T_1 + T_2) / (T_1 T_2) \) incorrectly adds \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) in the numerator.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 T_2)^2 \) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
