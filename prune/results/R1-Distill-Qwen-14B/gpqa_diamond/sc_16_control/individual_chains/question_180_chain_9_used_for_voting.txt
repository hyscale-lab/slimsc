Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Okay, the question says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Out of these, 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So, I'm thinking this has to do with electric potential energy, right? Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy, especially in an isolated system where kinetic energy might be minimized.

Wait, the problem says the system is isolated. So, I think for the minimum energy, all the kinetic energy would be zero because the particles are constrained. Or does that not matter? Maybe I should focus on the potential energy.

So, the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2e and are at 2 meters from P, and they're fixed there. So, the 13th charge is at P, so its distance from each of the other 12 is 2 meters.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed one is also 2e. So, what's the potential energy between each pair?

Wait, potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, right? And since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate all the pairwise interactions and sum them up.

But wait, in this case, the fixed charge is at point P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2m from P. So, how many pairs does that involve?

Each of the 12 charges at 2m will interact with the fixed charge at P. So, that's 12 interactions. Each involving 2e and 2e, with r = 2m.

But wait, are there interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because the 12 are at the same distance from P, but are they all the same distance from each other? Hmm, that's tricky. Because if they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, their arrangement could be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. So the distance between any two of them would be the chord length of the sphere, which depends on the angle between them. But I don't know the exact positions, so maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 are arranged in such a way that the distance between any two is the same. But wait, 12 points on a sphere? That's a bit like the vertices of an icosahedron or something, but perhaps for simplicity, the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are to be considered as negligible, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because the problem states the 12 are constrained at 2m from P, so their mutual distances could vary, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. So, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge. That would make the calculation manageable.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". So, perhaps the potential energy is minimized when the mutual interactions are considered in a way that minimizes the total energy. Alternatively, maybe the system's minimum energy is just the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between all pairs of the 12 charges.

But how? Let's think.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, and the fixed charge is at P. So, each of the 12 is 2e, the fixed one is 2e. So, the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is (k*(2e)*(2e))/2m. Since there are 12 such pairs, thatâ€™s 12 multiplied by that value.

Additionally, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. So, their potential energies with each other would depend on their positions. To find the minimum energy, perhaps we can arrange them in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but if the system is isolated and the charges are fixed in their positions (they can't move except as per constraints), then their mutual potential energies are fixed as well. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify whether the 12 are fixed in their positions relative to each other or only their distance from P is fixed. Oh, the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, their positions can vary on the sphere of radius 2m around P, but their exact arrangement can affect the mutual potential energy.

To minimize the total potential energy, perhaps the charges arrange themselves in a way that the mutual repulsion is as low as possible. Wait, but all charges are positive (since each is 2e). So, since like charges repel, arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy. Wait, but wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive because U = k q1 q2 / r. So when you bring them closer, the potential energy increases. So to minimize the potential energy, you would want them as far apart as possible. But in a sphere of radius r, the maximum distance between any two points is 2r, so 4 meters in this case. But arranging all 12 charges to be all as far apart as possible on the sphere is impossible because each charge would need to be diametrically opposed to every other, which isn't possible for more than two points.

So maybe the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are negligible or that we can ignore them for the sake of calculation. Or perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energies between the fixed charge and the moving charges, not the mutual potential energies among the moving charges. Because that would make the problem solvable with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and it's intended to only consider the fixed charge and the 12 others, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again. The question is about the minimum energy of the system. So, the system's potential energy is the sum of all the pairwise potential energies.

But given that all 12 charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P, each of the 12 is 2e, and the 13th is 2e.

So, the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is U1. There are 12 such terms.

The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges is U2. Since there are 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is C(12,2) = 66. So, if I can find the average or total potential energy between each pair, I can sum all U1 and U2 contributions.

But without knowing the exact arrangement of the 12 charges, I can't compute the exact U2 terms. Unless we make an assumption. For example, the system might be such that the charges are equally spaced on the sphere, such that each pair is at the same distance apart. But that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere unless it's a regular polyhedron, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges themselves. Then, the mutual energies would be zero or we're just not considering them. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the mutual repulsion would contribute to the system's energy.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. If we can arrange the 12 charges in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized, perhaps that's part of the problem.

But because all the charges are positive, the minimum potential energy would occur when the charges are as far apart as possible. So, arranging them as far apart as possible on the sphere. But without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other, which would only be possible if all 12 are at a single point 2m away from P, but that's impossible because then they'd all be on top of each other, leading to infinitely large potential energy. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the question. It says, "the 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So, each of the 12 must remain at a distance of exactly 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 13th is at P, and each of the 12 is on a sphere of radius 2m around P.

So, the potential energy contributions are:

1. Between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges (each at 2m distance): 12 terms of U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). Wait, no, each term is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m. Because both charges are 2e.

2. Between each pair of the 12 charges. Each pair is at some distance r apart. But without knowing the arrangement, how can we compute this?

But the question is about the minimum energy. So, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But arranging 12 points on a sphere to maximize the distances between them would minimize the potential energy since U is positive for like charges. Wait, no, U is positive, so to minimize the total, we want each pair's U to be as small as possible, which would mean as large a separation as possible.

So, the minimal potential energy would occur when the 12 charges are arranged such that each pair is as far apart as possible on the sphere. But how to calculate that?

Wait, in a sphere, the maximum distance between any two points is 4 meters (since radius is 2, diameter is 4). But if all 12 charges are at the same point, that's impossible since they can't occupy the same location without infinite repulsion. Alternatively, arranging them on the vertices of a regular polyhedron would give each pair a certain distance, but I'm not sure what that is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem neglects the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, considering that the fixed charge's potential energy dominates or that the mutual terms cancel out. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The system is isolated, so the total mechanical energy is the sum of all the potential energies. But without knowing the velocities, the kinetic energy is zero (assuming the system is in equilibrium, which might be the case for the minimum energy). So, the minimum energy is just the sum of all potential energies.

But again, without knowing the mutual distances between the 12 charges, how can I compute their potential energy?

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, and not their mutual potential energies. Let me check the options. The options are in the order of 1e-26 or so.

Let me compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12.

Each has charge 2e, so q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e.

The formula is U = (k * q1 q2) / r.

r is 2 meters. So, each pair contributes U = (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

Number of such pairs: 12.

So, total U1 = 12 * [ (k * (4eÂ²) ) / 2 ] = 12 * [ 2 k eÂ² ] = 24 k eÂ².

Wait, but wait, what's the value of e? The elementary charge is approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs.

And k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

So, let's compute this.

First, compute eÂ²: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 CÂ².

Then, 4eÂ² = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 CÂ².

Then, each pair's U is (8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37) / 2.

Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, the fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m. So, each pair contributes U = (k * (2e)(2e)) / 2 = (k *4eÂ²)/2 = 2k eÂ².

Wait, no, wait: correct, because 2e * 2e is 4eÂ².

So, each U is (k *4eÂ²)/r. r is 2, so 4eÂ²/(2) = 2eÂ². So each U is 2 k eÂ².

So, for 12 pairs, it's 12 * 2 k eÂ² = 24 k eÂ².

But let's compute that numerically.

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So, eÂ² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 CÂ².

So, 4eÂ² = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Each pair: (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

Wait, no, wait: the denominator is r = 2 m. So, (8.988e9) * (4eÂ²) / 2.

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, each pair between fixed and 12 charges is (2e)(2e) / (2m) * k.

So, U per pair: (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2m) = (k *4eÂ²)/(2m) = (2 k eÂ²) / m.

Wait, no, no, 2e multiplied by 2e is 4eÂ². Divided by r=2 m.

So, U = (k *4eÂ²) / (2) = 2 k eÂ².

So, each pair contributes 2 k eÂ².

So, 12 pairs give U1 = 24 k eÂ².

But wait, let me compute that.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 *24 = 215,712e9? Wait, 8.988e9 * 24 is 8.988 *24 = approx 215.712, so 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Then, multiply by eÂ².

eÂ² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 CÂ².

So, 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

Multiply 2.15712e11 by 2.566e-38.

2.15712e11 = 2.15712 * 10^11.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 10^-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.15712 * 2.566 â‰ˆ 5.547.

Add exponents: 10^11 * 10^-38 = 10^-27.

So, approximately 5.547e-27.

Wait, but I'm getting U1 as approx 5.547e-27 J.

But the options are in the 1e-26 range. Wait, option C is 7.056e-27, B is 2.822e-26, A is 5.645e-26.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Because each of them is 2e, so each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them.

But without knowing r_ij for all pairs, it's hard to calculate. Unless all the 12 charges are arranged in a way that all mutual distances are equal, which is possible as the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but I don't know the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are negligible, but that would mean the minimum energy is about 5.5e-27 J, which isn't any of the options except C (7.056e-27). But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me re-do the calculation.

Compute 24 * k * eÂ².

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

eÂ² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 CÂ².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let's compute 24 *8.988e9.

24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) * 1e(11-38) = approx 5.547 * 1e-27.

So, 5.547e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is close but higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2? Because each of the 12 charges is 2e, so perhaps each U is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = 2 k eÂ².

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, each charge is 2e. So, both the fixed and the moving charges are 2e.

So, U for each pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m.

Which is (k *4eÂ²)/(2m) = 2 k eÂ²/m.

Wait, wait, no, m is the distance. So, 2 meters.

So, 2 k eÂ² / 2 = k eÂ².

Wait, because denominator is 2 m, so 2 m.

Wait, let me correct that.

Each term is (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m) = (k *4 eÂ²) / (2 m) = (2 k eÂ²) / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters. So, it's 2 k eÂ² / 2 = k eÂ².

Wait, I see, so each pair contributes k eÂ².

So, 12 pairs: 12 * k eÂ².

Wait, that's different from before. So, let's recalculate.

12 * k * eÂ².

k = 8.988e9.

eÂ² = 2.566e-38.

So, 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

12 * 8.988e9 = 1.07856e11.

1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = approx 2.767e-27.

Wait, 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38).

1.07856 *2.566 â‰ˆ 2.767.

So, 2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.767e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is B) 2.822e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher. Or option C) 7.056e-27, which is 7e-27, which is higher than 2.7e-27.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the U per pair:

Each pair is between the fixed (2e) and each of the 12 (2e) at 2m.

So, U per pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

Wait, that's (k *4 eÂ²) / (2 m) = (2 k eÂ²) / m.

But m is 2, so 2 k eÂ² / 2 = k eÂ².

So, each pair contributes k eÂ².

So, 12 pairs: 12 k eÂ².

Which is 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

So, let me compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 first.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e(9-38) = approx 22.99e-29 = 2.299e-28.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2.299e-28 = 2.759e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.76e-27 J.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are A: 5.645e-26, B: 2.822e-26, C:7.056e-27, D:122.330.

So, 2.76e-27 is close to option C (7.056e-27) but it's about a third of that.

Wait, did I miscalculate the exponents?

Let me recompute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply together: 8.988 *2.566 = approx 23.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29.

So, 23e-29 = 2.3e-28.

Multiply by 12 gives 27.6e-29 = 2.76e-28? No, wait 12 * 2.3e-28 is 27.6e-28, which is 2.76e-27.

Which is 2.76e-27 J.

So, none of the options match. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 and option B:2.822e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. No, it's 12 pairs, each involving the fixed charge and one of the 12.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Let's consider that.

If each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary. To compute their mutual potential energies, I need to sum U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij for each pair.

But without knowing r_ij for each pair, it's impossible to compute. Unless the problem assumes that each mutual distance is 2 m, but that's not possible because then the 12 charges would all be at the same point, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges form a regular icosahedron around the fixed charge, but I don't know the exact distance between adjacent charges in that case. Let me think: the regular icosahedron has 12 vertices. The edge length would be the distance between any two adjacent vertices. But I don't remember the exact formula, but perhaps the distance can be calculated from the radius of the circumscribed sphere.

Wait, the radius of the circumscribed sphere (R) for a regular icosahedron is R = (edge length) * (sqrt(Ï†Â² +1 )) / 2, where Ï† is the golden ratio (~1.618). Alternatively, I found that for a regular icosahedron, the edge length 'a' is related to the radius R by R = a * sqrt(Ï†Â² + 1)/2. But I'm not sure, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find R in terms of a. Let me look it up mentally. For a regular icosahedron, the formula is R = a * sqrt(Ï†Â² + 1)/2. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just avoid this and think that the problem is only considering the fixed charge and the 12, so the mutual terms are negligible or not considered, but that leaves us with 2.76e-27 J, which is not an option.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the exponents in calculation. Let me recompute the per pair energy.

Each pair's U is k*(2e)^2/(2m) = (k *4eÂ²)/(2m).

Wait, no, the denominator is just the distance between the two charges. So, fixed charge is at P, the other is 2m away, so r=2.

So, U per pair = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 = (4 k eÂ²) / 2 = 2 k eÂ².

Wait, no, wait, 2e *2e is 4eÂ², divided by 2 gives 2eÂ².

So, each of the 12 pairs contribute 2 k eÂ².

So, 12 pairs: 24 k eÂ².

Ah, that makes more sense. So earlier I messed up the calculation.

So, 24 * k * eÂ².

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 CÂ².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = ?

2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) * 1e( -38 +9 )= approx 23 * 1e-29 = 2.3e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.3e-28 = 55.2e-28 = 5.52e-27 J.

So, about 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than our calculated 5.52e-27.

Hmm, but perhaps I should consider the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, the 12 charges are each 2e, so each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

The sum over all pairs is C(12,2) =66 pairs.

Assuming that each pair is equally distant, which for a sphere would require a symmetric arrangement. Let's say each pair is at a distance r from each other. Then, the total mutual energy is 66 * [k*(2e)^2/r ].

But what is r? For 12 identical charges on a sphere, the average distance between them can be calculated, but I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies, as they are more complicated. But in that case, our initial calculation of 5.5e-27 J would be the answer, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Because each of the 12 is fixed at 2m from P. So, the fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m. So, each of the 12 contributes a pair with the fixed charge, and each pair between the 12 is another term.

Wait, perhaps I should compute both contributions.

So, the total potential energy is U_total = U_between_fixed_and_12 + U_between_12_pairs.

So, U_between_fixed_and_12 is 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2)] = 12 * [ (4 k eÂ²)/2 ] = 12 * 2 k eÂ² = 24 k eÂ².

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Earlier, I computed this as approximately 5.52e-27 J.

Now, for U_between_12_pairs, each pair is 2e and 2e, so each contributes U =k*(2e)^2/r_ij.

Assuming all r_ij are the same, which would be the case in a regular icosahedron, but I don't know the exact r_ij.

Wait, for a regular icosahedron with 12 vertices, each vertex is on a sphere of radius R. The edge length a is the distance between adjacent vertices. So, the distance between two adjacent vertices is a.

Now, the formula relating R and a for a regular icosahedron is R = a * sqrt(Ï†Â² + 1)/2, where Ï† is the golden ratio (â‰ˆ1.618).

Wait, perhaps I can find R in terms of a: R = (a/2) * sqrt( Ï†Â² + 1 )

But Ï† = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 â‰ˆ 1.618.

So, Ï†Â² â‰ˆ 2.618.

So sqrt( Ï†Â² + 1 ) = sqrt(3.618) â‰ˆ 1.902.

So R â‰ˆ a * 1.902 / 2 â‰ˆ a * 0.951.

But in our case, R is 2 m.

So, a â‰ˆ R / 0.951 â‰ˆ 2 / 0.951 â‰ˆ 2.103 m.

So, the edge length a is approximately 2.103 m.

But wait, that's the distance between adjacent charges. But in reality, the 12 charges might not all be adjacent to each other, but arranged such that each has 5 neighbors at a distance a. But regardless, the mutual potential energy would be for each pair, but the number of pairs is 66, and each pair is at a certain distance.

But if we assume that each of the 66 pairs is at a distance of about 2.103 m, then the mutual potential energy would be 66 * [ k*(2e)^2/(2.103) ].

But wait, this is a rough approximation, and the actual potential energy would be more complicated, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this.

But, if we include this, let's compute.

So, U_mutual = 66 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2.103 ]

Compute (2e)^2 =4eÂ².

So, [k *4eÂ² ] / 2.103 = (8.988e9 *4eÂ²) /2.103.

Wait, but let's compute each term.

Each term is (8.988e9 *4eÂ²) / 2.103.

Wait, but wait, 4eÂ² is 4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4 *2.566e-38 =1.0264e-37.

So, 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = (8.988 *1.0264) *1e(9-37) â‰ˆ 9.24 *1e-28 =9.24e-28.

Divide by 2.103: 9.24e-28 / 2.103 â‰ˆ4.4e-28.

Multiply by 66: 66 *4.4e-28 =2.904e-26.

So, U_mutual â‰ˆ2.904e-26 J.

Now, adding U_fixed_12 =5.52e-27 J, and U_mutual=2.904e-26 J.

Total U = 2.904e-26 +0.552e-26 =3.456e-26 J.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is B) 2.822e-26, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy isn't supposed to be considered, which would bring our total to approximately 5.52e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in including the mutual potential energy.

Wait, another approach. The system's potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

In our case, the 13th charge is fixed, so it's interacting with each of the 12 moving charges. Additionally, each moving charge interacts with all the others.

So, the total potential energy is:

U_total = U_fixed_12 + U_moving_pairs.

Where U_fixed_12 =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =24 k eÂ².

U_moving_pairs = sum over all 66 pairs of (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

Assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that each pair is at the same distance r, which may not be the case, but for simplicity, let's proceed.

So, U_moving_pairs = 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/r.

But what is r? If the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, perhaps the average distance is the same as the edge length of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2 m.

Earlier, I estimated r (edge length) as approximately 2.103 meters.

So, U_moving_pairs =66 * (4 k eÂ²)/(2.103).

Compute this.

4 *8.988e9 =35.95e9.

35.95e9 * eÂ² =35.95e9 *2.566e-38 = approx 9.22e-29.

Divide by 2.103:9.22e-29 /2.103â‰ˆ4.38e-29.

Multiply by 66:4.38e-29 *66â‰ˆ2.90e-27.

So, U_moving_pairsâ‰ˆ2.90e-27 J.

Then, U_fixed_12 is24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =5.52e-27 J.

So, total U_total=5.52e-27 +2.90e-27=8.42e-27 J.

Hmm, this is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy isn't considered, and the correct answer is U=5.5e-27 J, which is not among the options. But the options have option C as 7.056e-27, which is about 30% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mutual potential energy. Because all 12 charges are positive, their mutual repulsion increases the potential energy, so the minimum energy should include this.

But the options don't have an 8e-27 J option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and not the mutual ones. So, the answer would be 5.5e-27 J. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, maybe I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, 13 charges: the 13th is fixed, 12 are moving. So, the number of pairs between fixed and moving is 12. The number of pairs between moving is C(12,2)=66.

But if the problem is considering only the fixed and moving, and not the moving-moving pairs, then the answer is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the formula is U = (k*q1*q2)/(r), and for the fixed charge, each pair is 2e and 2e, so each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = (4 k eÂ²)/2= 2 k eÂ².

So, 12 such terms: 12 * 2 k eÂ² =24 k eÂ².

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.299e-28.

Multiply by 24:2.299e-28 *24=5.518e-27 J.

So, about 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, there's option C:7.056e-27, which is higher than this.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each 2e, and the fixed charge is also 2e, so the total charge is 13 *2e =26e.

But that doesn't directly affect the potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that each charge is 2e, but when you have multiple charges, the potential at each charge due to others is considered, but perhaps I'm double-counting something.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy should be calculated by considering the work done to bring each charge into place. Let me think differently.

The potential energy can be calculated as the sum of the potential energies added when each charge is brought into place.

The fixed charge is at P. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought to a distance of 2m from P.

But when bringing each charge, the potential at the position due to all the other charges already placed.

Wait, when bringing the first charge, the potential at P due to the 13th charge is zero (since it's the only one there). Wait, no, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, when bringing the first charge (charge 2e) to 2m from P, the potential at that point is just the potential due to the fixed charge at P, which is (k*(2e))/(2m).

So, the work done to bring the first charge is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at 2m due to the fixed charge.

V = (k*(2e))/(2m) = (k e)/(m).

So, work done is (2e) * (k e)/(m) = 2 k eÂ²/m.

Similarly, when bringing the second charge, the potential at 2m is due to the fixed charge (2e) and the first charge (2e).

So, the potential at 2m would be V = (k*(2e) + k*(2e))/(2m) )= (4e k)/(2m) = 2 e k/(m).

So, the work done is (2e) * (2 e k/m) )= 4 eÂ² k/m.

Wait, but this approach would require considering the potential due to all existing charges when placing each new charge. This might complicate things, but perhaps it's the correct way to calculate the potential energy.

So, the total potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring each charge into place.

Let me compute this step by step.

Charge 1:

Potential at 2m due to fixed charge: V1 = (k*(2e))/(2m) = k e/(m).

Work done: q * V1 = (2e) * (k e/m) )= 2 k eÂ²/m.

Charge 2:

Potential at 2m is due to fixed charge (2e) and charge 1 (2e):

V2 = (k*(2e) +k*(2e) )/(2m) )= (4e k)/(2m )= 2 e k/m.

Work done: (2e) * (2 e k/m )=4 k eÂ²/m.

Charge 3:

Potential now includes fixed (2e), charge1 (2e), and charge2 (2e).

So, V3 = (k*(2e)*3) / (2m) )= 3 e k/m.

Work done: 2e * 3 e k/(m )=6 k eÂ²/m.

Wait, this seems like a pattern. The nth charge (n from 1 to12) requires a potential of (n * 2e) / (2m) ) * k.

So, Vn = (2e *n )/(2m) *k = (e k n )/m.

Work done: (2e) * Vn = 2e * (e k n/m )= 2 k eÂ² n/m.

So, the work done for each charge n is 2 k eÂ² n/m.

So, the total work done is sum from n=1 to12 of 2 k eÂ² n/m.

Which is 2 k eÂ²/m * sum(n=1 to12) n.

Sum(n=1 to12) is (12)(13)/2=78.

So, total work done is 2 k eÂ²/m *78 = 156 k eÂ²/m.

But m is 2 m.

So, 156 k eÂ²/(2) )=78 k eÂ².

Wait, so U =78 k eÂ².

Now, let's compute that.

Compute 78 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

First, compute (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =approx 2.299e-28.

Multiply by78:78 *2.299e-28 â‰ˆ1.782e-26 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.782e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option A is5.645e-26, which is higher, option B is2.822e-26, which is higher than 1.78e-26.

Hmm, this is a different approach but the result doesn't match any options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because when you bring charges one by one, each new charge contributes to the potential for the next. But perhaps the correct formula for the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of (k q_i q_j)/r_ij for all i<j.

In that case, for the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges, each contributes 12 terms of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So, 12 * (4 k eÂ²)/(2m) )= 12 * (2 k eÂ²/m )=24 k eÂ²/m.

m=2, so 12 * (2 k eÂ²/2 )=12 k eÂ².

So, U_fixed_12=12 k eÂ².

Now, for the 12 moving charges, each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij. But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem assumes that all moving charges are at the same distance from each other, which would be 2m, but that's not possible because they are on a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the moving charges are arranged such that each is at 2m from each other, which is impossible with 12 points on a sphere. So, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero or negligible, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies, which leaves the potential energy as 12 k eÂ².

Compute 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.299e-28.

12 *2.299e-28=2.759e-27 J.

Hmm, 2.76e-27 J, which is close to option C's 7.056e-27 but lower.

Wait, but according to this approach, the answer is approximately 2.76e-27 J, which is not among the options. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me re-calculate.

Compute 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Now, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients:8.988 *2.566â‰ˆ22.98.

Exponents:1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So, 22.98e-29 =2.298e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.298e-28 *12=2.758e-27 J.

So, about 2.76e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps the charges are not 2e but e. Because looking back, the question says each charge is 2e.

Hmm, perhaps a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, 2.76e-27 is 2.76 x10^-27 J.

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum when bringing the charges in. Let me try that approach again.

Alternative approach: calculating the potential energy as the sum of all pairs.

The fixed charge is 2e.

Each of the 12 moving charges is 2e.

Each moving charge is at 2m from the fixed charge.

So, the potential energy between fixed and each moving charge is U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4 k eÂ²)/(2m) ) = 2 k eÂ²/m.

So, for 12 charges:12 *2 k eÂ²/m =24 k eÂ²/m.

m=2m, so 24 k eÂ²/(2) )=12 k eÂ².

So, U_fixed_12=12 k eÂ².

Now, the potential energy between each pair of moving charges is U_ij = (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, we can't compute this. However, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this term, considering it negligible or that the configuration minimizes it.

If we include the mutual potential energy, we need to know the sum over all pairs. But without data, perhaps the intended answer is 12 k eÂ².

So, let's compute 12 k eÂ².

k=8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

e=1.602e-19 C.

So, 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.299e-28.

Multiply by12:2.299e-28 *12=2.759e-27 J.

So, about 2.76e-27 J.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I should convert e from coulombs correctly.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C.

So, e squared is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 CÂ².

So, the calculations are correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The only option close to this is option C:7.056e-27, which is about twice as high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me think again.

Wait, each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so the fixed charge is 2e and each moving is 2e. So, the potential energy for each pair is (k*(2e)(2e))/(2m)= (4 k eÂ²)/(2m)=2 k eÂ²/m.

So, 12 terms:12 *2 k eÂ²/m.

m=2, so 2 k eÂ²/m =k eÂ².

So, 12 *k eÂ².

So, 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

=12 * (8.988 *2.566) *1e9 *1e-38.

8.988 *2.566 â‰ˆ23.

12 *23 =276.

Exponent:1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So, 276e-29 =2.76e-27 J.

So, the same result as before.

Hmm. None of the options match.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher than our result.

So, perhaps the problem statement had a typo, and the charge is 2e multiplied by 12, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps in the number of terms.

Wait, another possibility: the problem considers the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges, each with charge e, not 2e. Let me see what happens.

If each charge is e instead of 2e.

Then, each U between fixed and moving is (k *e *e)/(2m)= (k eÂ²)/(2m).

So, 12 terms:12 * (k eÂ²)/(2m)=6 k eÂ²/m.

m=2:6 k eÂ²/2=3 k eÂ².

Compute 3 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

3 *8.988e9=26.964e9.

26.964e9 *2.566e-38=6.937e-28.

Which is about 6.94e-28 J, which is much smaller than the options.

So, that doesn't fit either.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated using the formula U = (1/2) * q * V, where V is the potential at the point where the charge is placed.

So, if the fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 charges is placed at 2m, then the potential at each placement due to the fixed charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = k e/m.

Each charge contributes (1/2) * (2e) * V.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this approach.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble all charges, considering the potential they create at each other's positions.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum for each charge of q multiplied by the potential at its position due to all other charges already placed.

So, U = sum_{i=1 to13} q_i * V_i,

where V_i is the potential at the position of charge i due to all charges before it.

In our case, the fixed charge is at P, so when placing the first moving charge, the potential at its position is due to the fixed charge.

Then, when placing the second moving charge, the potential is due to the fixed charge and the first moving charge.

So, let's compute this.

Fixed charge: q=2e at P.

Moving charges: q=2e each.

Number of moving charges:12.

Compute the potential energy step by step.

Charge 1 (moving):

Placed at 2m from P.

Potential due to fixed charge: V1 = (k*(2e))/(2m) )= (k e)/m.

Work done: q * V1 = (2e) * (k e/m )= 2 k eÂ²/m.

Charge 2:

Potential V2 is due to fixed charge and charge1.

V2 = (k*(2e))/(2m) ) + (k*(2e))/(distance between charge1 and charge2).

But without knowing the distance between charge1 and charge2, it's hard to compute. But assuming that all moving charges are at the same distance from each other, perhaps 2m, which isn't possible as they are on a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that when placing the second charge, it's at a distance r from the first. But without knowing r, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore mutual terms.

But this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial calculation, the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges is about 5.52e-27 J. But none of the options match this. However, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 30% higher.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of terms. Let's recheck.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. So, 12 terms. Each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4 k eÂ²)/(2m) )= 2 k eÂ²/m.

So, 12 * (2 k eÂ²/m )=24 k eÂ²/m.

m=2, so 24 k eÂ²/(2) )=12 k eÂ².

Wait, so U_fixed_12=12 k eÂ².

Compute 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 12 * (8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ).

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.299e-28.

12 *2.299e-28=2.759e-27 J.

So, U_fixed_12=2.759e-27 J.

Hmm. So, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible, and the answer is approximately 2.76e-27 J, which isn't among the options. So, this suggests that perhaps I missed a factor of 3, but I can't see where.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the charge is 2e multiplied by 12, but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 2 meters, but I used meters correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using coulombs and meters correctly, but perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the unit conversion. Let me recompute 12 *k *eÂ².

k=8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

e=1.602e-19 C.

So, eÂ²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 CÂ².

So, k*eÂ²=8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.298e-28 JÂ·m.

Multiply by12 gives 27.58e-28 J =2.758e-27 J.

So, no, that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the intended answer is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J. But why?

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that each of the 12 charges contributes 6e instead of 2e. But that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. The 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are moving, each with charge 2e. So, the fixed charge is 2e, each moving is 2e. So, 12 terms of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Let me compute 12 * (k *4eÂ²)/(2m).

Wait, 4eÂ²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*2.566e-38=1.0264e-37.

k=8.988e9.

So, each term is (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37) /2 = (9.23e-28)/2=4.615e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.615e-28 *12=5.538e-27 J.

Which is about 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option A is5.645e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the exponents again.

Wait, 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 =8.988e9 *1.0264e-37.

8.988e9 is 8.988 *1e9.

1.0264e-37 is 1.0264 *1e-37.

Multiply coefficients:8.988 *1.0264â‰ˆ9.22.

Exponents:1e9 *1e-37=1e-28.

So, 9.22e-28.

Divide by 2:4.61e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.53e-27.

So, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm not sure why this isn't matching any options. Perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Coulomb's constant is approximately 8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ². Let me double-check that. Yes, that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem considers that each moving charge is 2e, and the fixed charge is 2e, so each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), but multiplied by 13. But that would be incorrect because the fixed charge isn't moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in different units, but that's unlikely.

At this point, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges is approximately 5.54e-27 J, which isn't an option. The closest option is C)7.056e-27 J, which is about 28% higher. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see how to reach that number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at the fixed charge, but that seems unlikely as the fixed charge is already in place.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated using the formula U = (1/2) * sum_{i<j} (k q_i q_j)/r_ij.

So, for the fixed charge and the 12 moving, it's (1/2)*12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which is (1/2)*12*(4 k eÂ²)/(2m)= (1/2)*12*(2 k eÂ²/m )= (1/2)*24 k eÂ²/m=12 k eÂ²/m.

m=2:6 k eÂ².

Which is 6 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:6 *8.988e9=5.3928e10.

5.3928e10 *2.566e-38=1.382e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.38e-27 J, which is even smaller and not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not seeing how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have 13 charges, each with charge e, but the question says 2e.

If each charge is e, then:

Each term (fixed and moving): (k * e *e)/(2m).

12 terms:12*(k eÂ²)/(2m)=6 k eÂ²/m.

m=2:3 k eÂ².

Compute 3 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2=3 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38=3 *2.299e-28=6.897e-28 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps I'll go with the initial calculation that the potential energy is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute 7.056e-27 divided by 5.52e-27, which is approximately 1.278.

So, 7.056e-27 =5.52e-27 *1.278.

Which suggests that perhaps the calculation included a factor of sqrt(3) or something, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considered the charges as point charges and used the formula for the energy of a configuration where each charge is at radius r from the center, but that's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the formula for the energy of a point charge configuration, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the initial calculation, the energy is about 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is close to the calculation when including mutual terms, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs of charges.

   - Each pair of charges contributes \( U = \frac{k (2e)^2}{r} \), where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant (\( 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)), \( e \) is the elementary charge (\( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - For one pair:  
     \[
     U = \frac{k (2e)^2}{2} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
     \]
   - There are 12 such pairs, so the total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-12}} = 12 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 24 k e^2
     \]

2. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Compute \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \).
   - Compute \( k e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.299 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{JÂ·m} \).
   - Multiply by 24:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-12}} = 24 \cdot 2.299 \times 10^{-28} = 5.518 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Moving Charges**:
   - The 12 charges are constrained on a sphere of radius 2 m, and their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. For simplicity, the problem likely assumes that the mutual potential energy is either negligible or not explicitly calculated.
   - If included, the mutual potential energy would involve summing contributions from all \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs, but without specific distances, this term cannot be precisely determined.

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges is approximately \( 5.52 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which does not match any of the provided options.
   - The closest option is \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) (Option C), which is about 28% higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the problem setup or an approximation in the options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges is approximately \( 5.52 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). Since this value does not match any option, the most reasonable choice is **Option C: \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, assuming the problem accounts for additional terms or approximations not explicitly stated.
