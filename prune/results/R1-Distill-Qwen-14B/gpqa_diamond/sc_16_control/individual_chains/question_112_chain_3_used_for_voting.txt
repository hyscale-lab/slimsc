Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, implying it's not necessarily normalized yet. Normalizing might be the first step.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis. The state |alpha> is a linear combination of these, so it's a two-component spinor, probably in the z-basis.

But the problem then asks about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix is given by Aij. So Aij is such that A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, what's the matrix for that? Since it's 2x2 (because we're talking about spin-1/2 particles, I think), the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because for i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, and when i=j, it's zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would be zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So yeah, that's the matrix.

Now, this operator A must have certain eigenstates. Because the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So first, find the eigenstates of A, then find the probabilities when |alpha> is projected onto those eigenstates.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about operator A. Its matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So, it's a symmetric matrix, which means it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0. So, for a 2x2 matrix:

| -λ    ħ/2        |
| ħ/2   -λ        |  = 0

The determinant is (λ^2) - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) = 0. So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, the operator A has two eigenstates with these eigenvalues.

Now, the eigenvectors can be found. For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I)|v> = 0 → [ [-λ, ħ/2 ], [ħ/2, -λ] ] [v1; v2] = 0.

Wait, substituting λ = ħ/2:

[ [-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2] ] [v1; v2] = 0.

So the equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1; 1]. Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

[ [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ] [v1; v2] = 0 → (ħ/2)(v1 + v2) = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are [1; -1] and [1; 1], up to normalization.

Wait, but let me confirm that. For λ = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes:

[ (ħ/2), (ħ/2) ]
[ (ħ/2), (ħ/2) ]

Which gives the equation (ħ/2)(v1 + v2) = 0. So v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to [1; -1].

Wait, but these vectors are only up to a scalar multiple. So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), or something along those lines, I think. Because [1; 1] can be normalized to 1/sqrt(2) times (|up> + |down>), and [1; -1] would be 1/sqrt(2) times (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of operator A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Wait, but wait. Wait, operator A is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix elements are:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Which is the same as the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, which are the ones I mentioned.

So the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ = ħ/2 and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ = -ħ/2.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the initial state is |alpha>. Also, find the average value of the operator A.

So first, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of these eigenstates. Because probability is the square of the amplitude when projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

Wait, but before that, I think I should normalize |alpha> because the initial state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

So |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant.

The normalization condition is |c|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ] = 1.

So let's compute |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So |c|^2 *7 =1 → |c|=1/sqrt(7). So c=1/sqrt(7), since the phase doesn't matter here.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the eigenstates of A are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination: |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

So substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But from earlier, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So equating coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i) / sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

So we have two equations:

a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) → Wait, no, wait: Let me write them:

a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
a - b = (2 -i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Wait, because I have (a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7). So multiplying both sides by sqrt(2):

a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) → which simplifies to (1+i) * sqrt(2/7).

Similarly, a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7).

So now we have two equations:

a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

We can solve for a and b by adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding the two equations: 2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7) → So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7).

Subtracting the equations: 2b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (1 + i - 2 + i) sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7)
→ b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Hmm, but perhaps there's a better way to find the coefficients a and b. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Because the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for |−x>.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

Then, < +x | alpha > =  [ <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ]  [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

But <up|up> =1, <down|down>=1, and <up|down>=0, same for the others.

So this simplifies to:

[ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*0 + (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(14))
= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ 3 ] / sqrt(14) → because (1+i + 2 -i)=3.

So the amplitude is 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.643.

Similarly, compute < −x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So < −x | alpha > = [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Again, cross terms are zero. So this becomes:

[ (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*0 + 0 - (2 -i)*1 ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)

The absolute square is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again. The numerator is (-1 + 2i), so the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So |amplitude|^2 =5/14≈0.357.

Hmm, wait a second, because 9/14 is about 0.6428 and 5/14 is about 0.357, but their sum is 14/14=1, which makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. That's close to what I just got. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for the inner product.

For < +x | alpha >:

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) → 3/sqrt(14).

Yes, that's correct. So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), so |amplitude|^2 is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, for < −x | alpha >:

The numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i → so the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5 → 5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, what about the average value of operator A?

The average value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state |alpha> is (|up> + (2-i)|down> )/sqrt(7).

Wait, wait, no. |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all over sqrt(7).

So to compute <A>, we can write it as (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ] multiplied by A and then (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)*, (2-i)* ]^T.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to note that A is (ħ/2) ( |up><down| + |down><up| ).

So <A> = (ħ/2) [ <alpha| up><down| alpha> + <alpha| down><up| alpha> ).

Alternatively, <A> = (ħ/2) [ ( <alpha|up> ) ( <down| alpha> ) + ( <alpha|down> ) ( <up| alpha> ) ) ]

Because |up><down| acting on |alpha> gives |up> <down|alpha>, and similar for |down><up|.

So let me compute these terms.

First, <alpha|up> is (1-i)/sqrt(7) → because |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So the components are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2-i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So <alpha|up> = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
<alpha|down> = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Then, <down| alpha> is the complex conjugate of <alpha|up>, which is (1-i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, <up| alpha> is (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So substituting into <A>:

= (ħ/2) [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (1-i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 =1 - (-1)=2. So (2)/(7).

Second term: (2-i)(2+i)=4 - (i)^2=4 - (-1) =5. So 5/(7).

So <A> = (ħ/2) [ (2/7) + (5/7) ) ] → (ħ/2)(7/7) → (ħ/2)(1) → ħ/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option A has hbar/7 as the average. Others have different values. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me recompute the expectation value <A>.

Wait, another approach: |alpha> is a column vector, so [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So <A> is the vector multiplied by A, then dotted with the conjugate transpose.

Wait, no, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A times |alpha>.

So let's compute it.

|alpha> is [a; b], where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So A|alpha> is [0*a + (ħ/2)*b, (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ]^T → [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ]^T.

Then, the conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ a*, b* ].

So <A> = [a*, b* ] * A |alpha> = a* * (ħ/2) b + b* * (ħ/2) a.

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) ( a* b + b* a ) → (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

But a* b is (1 - i)(2 - i) / (7), and b* a is (2 + i)(1 + i)/(7).

Wait, let's compute a and b:

a=(1+i)/sqrt(7),
b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Thus, a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7),
b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1 - i)(2 - i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 → (since i^2=-1)
=1 -3i.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Multiply numerator:

2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
=2 + 2i + i + i^2
=2 +3i -1 → (i^2 =-1)
=1 +3i.

So a* b + b* a = (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Ah, so I must have made a mistake earlier. So the correct average is ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Wait, so the probabilities are approximately 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A) is 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7. That matches. So option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization constant \( c \) is determined by ensuring \( \| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = 1 \). The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are \( 1+i \) and \( 2-i \), respectively. Their magnitudes squared are \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \), so the total magnitude squared is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, \( c = 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is diagonalizable with eigenvalues \( \pm \hbar/2 \), and its eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates. The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \right|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

The total probabilities sum to 1, confirming normalization.

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( A = \hbar/2 \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \langle \alpha | \uparrow \rangle \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \alpha | \downarrow \rangle \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]

The components of \( |\alpha\rangle \) are \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). The conjugate pairs are \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle^* = \frac{1-i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle^* = \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{(1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)}{7} \right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
(1+i)(1-i) = 2, \quad (2-i)(2+i) = 5, \quad \text{so } \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{7}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

However, correcting for a miscalculation, the final result is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
