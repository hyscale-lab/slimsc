Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find out which energy difference between them would allow us to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with energy and time. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Wait, but what's the relation here? Oh, right! The lifetime of a state is related to the uncertainty in energy. A shorter lifetime (Δt) means a larger uncertainty in energy (ΔE), because they multiply to give a constant. So if the lifetime is τ, then ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

So the question is about the energy difference needed for the states to be clearly distinguishable. I think this means that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is too small compared to the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

But wait, each state has its own uncertainty. Let me think. The first state has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, so its energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, the second state has τ2 = 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or perhaps just larger than either of them? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the broader context. When two states are close in energy, their lifetimes are such that their uncertainties could overlap, making them hard to distinguish. So the energy difference should be larger than the maximum uncertainty between any two states in the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum energy difference required is determined by the uncertainty of the system's measurement. That is, we need the energy difference to be larger than the uncertainty in energy, so that the two states are resolvable.

Wait, another approach. The uncertainty principle gives a limit on how precisely you can measure the energy. If the energy difference is smaller than this uncertainty, you can't tell the two states apart. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable.

So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in energy. But wait, the uncertainty in energy here is the uncertainty from the measurement time. Or perhaps it's the uncertainty due to the lifetimes of the states themselves.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the mean lifetime of the state. But wait, each state has its own lifetime, so perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty caused by each state's lifetime.

Wait, but when you have two states, perhaps it's the uncertainty of the system as a whole. Or maybe the combined uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of either state. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, then you can't tell the states apart.

Wait, maybe I should compute the uncertainties for each state and see what the energy difference should be.

Let me compute the uncertainties in energy for each state. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. Now, to convert this to eV because the options are in eV.

1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So, ΔE1 = (1.05e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.55e-7 eV. So about 1e-6 eV?

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 1.05e-25 / 1.602e-19 = (1.05 / 1.602) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.655 * 1e-6 eV ≈ 6.55e-7 eV. So approximately 6.55e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.55e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.55e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.55e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the uncertainties so that you can measure a difference.

Wait, but in reality, each state's energy has some uncertainty. So if the two states' energy difference is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, you can distinguish them. Or perhaps the sum, because if ΔE is bigger than both, then it's clearly separated.

Wait, the uncertainty in E1 is about 6.55e-7 eV, E2's is 6.55e-8 eV. So the maximum uncertainty between the two states would be ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 7.2e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than this sum. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-6 eV.
Option B: 1e-11 eV = 0.01e-10 eV, which is 0.00001e-6 eV. Very small.
Option C: 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. That's 0.1e-3 eV. Wait, no: 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than our previous sum (which was about 7e-7 eV). So that would be sufficient.
Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Which is smaller than 7e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. If the energy difference is 1e-4 eV (option C), that's way larger than the uncertainty, so it's definitely resolvable. But the question asks which is a possible energy difference. So perhaps any of the options that are larger than the maximum uncertainty (about 7e-7 eV) would be correct.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV. Which is much larger than 7e-7 eV. So that's definitely resolvable.

Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001e-6, which is smaller than 7e-7 eV. So not resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 7e-7 eV.

So the correct energy difference must be larger than 7e-7 eV. So the only option that is larger is option C.

Wait, but the options also have option D as 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7. So option C is the only one that's sufficiently larger.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the uncertainties. Let me double-check.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s. τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.
Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. So 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1.05 / 1.6) * e-6 ≈ 0.656e-6 eV → 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J → 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = 6.56e-8 eV.

So sum is about 7.2e-7 eV.

So the required ΔE must be larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So the only option larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV (1e-4 eV) which is 1e-4=1e-4= 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV.

But wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is much larger than 7.2e-7.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \). Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau \)) of the states serve as the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:
\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]
where \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

For the first state (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state (\( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]
\[
\Delta E > 6.55 \times 10^{-7} + 6.55 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear distinguishability is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
