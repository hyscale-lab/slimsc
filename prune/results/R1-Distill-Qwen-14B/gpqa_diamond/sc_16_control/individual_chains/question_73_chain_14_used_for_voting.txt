Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics. So I need to use the relativistic formulas.

First, let's tackle the relative speed between them. Wait, wait. Relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting their velocities. Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me get it right. Oh right, when adding velocities in relativity, it's (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), but since here we're looking at the velocity of one as seen from the other, perhaps I need to compute it correctly.

Wait, no. Let me think. The astronauts are moving in the same direction. So, say astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait. The question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So, if they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of B as seen from A would be (v - u) divided by (1 - (u v)/c²). Because in the relative velocity formula, when you're finding the speed of object B from A's frame, it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Wait, let me double-check. The formula for relative velocity when both are in the same direction is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, u is the speed of A, and v is the speed of B. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Wait, that would give a negative speed, but relative speed is a positive value, so perhaps I should take the absolute value. Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6 * 0.5)c²/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.142857c. Since speed can't be negative, the magnitude is 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Alternatively, if I consider the other way around (A moving at 0.6c and B moving at 0.5c, but we're looking for B's speed from A's frame), the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.14c, but since speed is positive, it's 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

So that aligns with one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C and D have relative speed 0.14c. Option B has 0.1c, which is lower than what I calculated. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. Wait, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Because energy is a scalar quantity, so their energies add up.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for A.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Compute gamma for B.

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² = approximately 3.464 m c².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc². So option C matches both the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculation. For astronaut A: speed 0.6c, mass 2m.

Gamma for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Correct.

For astronaut B: speed 0.5c, mass 3m.

Gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Sum is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So yes, about 5.96 mc².

Therefore, the correct option is C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (速度 of astronaut A) and \(v = 0.5c\) (速度 of astronaut B). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14c
\]

Since speed is positive, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Mass of astronaut A: \(2m\), speed: \(0.6c\).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Mass of astronaut B: \(3m\), speed: \(0.5c\).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
