Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic) acid cleavage reaction, which usually breaks alkenes or alkynes, but wait, I think more specifically, it's used for the cleavage of double bonds. Oh right, when you have a double bond, like in an alkene, reacting with red phosphorus and HI can lead to some kind of addition or cleavage. Wait, maybe it's the hydroboration-oxidation reaction? No, that's with BH3. Oh, wait, the other one is the acid-catalyzed cleavage. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI might be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's about the cleavage of a triple bond. Oh no, wait, when you have an alkyne and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it can do a cleavage. Or perhaps it's for the hydration of alkynes. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reagents.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are known to be involved in the hydroxylation of alkenes. Or perhaps in the cleavage of a triple bond. Oh, wait, maybe it's the cleavage of a vinyl group. Alternatively, wait, I think that when alkenes react with HI, it's an addition reaction, like in the case of H2O, HBr, etc., but red phosphorus is sometimes used as a catalyst or in other contexts. Wait, another possibility: I think red phosphorus can be used in the presence of HI to cleave double bonds through a process called the oxymercuration reaction, but no, that's with mercury. Alternatively, maybe it's the acid-catalyzed hydration or some other addition.

Wait a minute, I'm getting a bit stuck on the reaction part. Let me look at the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X to figure out what it is. Once I know Compound X, I can determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

So, the IR data is: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. Let's think about what each peak could mean.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 might indicate an -OH group or maybe an amine. But looking at the other peaks, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, Compound X probably has an aromatic ring with substituents and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an acidic proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid.

Then, the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring because the two doublets each have 2H, which is typical for a substituent in the para position. So, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one at the para position and another elsewhere?

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If it's a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions, then the two doublets would each have 2H, which matches the data here. So, the ring is para-substituted. So, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group since the carbonyl is present.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) likely indicates a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to another group. Like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3), where the CH3 is at the end. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, which would be the case for a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. Maybe it's a geminal group or part of a branched chain. Wait, a doublet with 3H suggests that the CH3 is adjacent to a CH which has two neighboring protons. Hmm, but in a typical isobutyl group, the CH(CH2CH3)2 would have some splitting, but I'm not sure.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps. Or it's a CH in a branched chain, like part of a sec-butyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and an alkyl chain. Let's try to build this.

The IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm-1), aromatic (1610 and 1450), and an -OH (3400-2500, broad). Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester or ketone. But if the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid's -OH. But wait, another possibility: maybe the 1720 is an ester or ketone, and the -OH is part of an alcohol. Hmm, but in that case, the IR might show a broad peak for the alcohol's -OH.

Wait, but the peak at 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be an -OH, perhaps as in a phenol. But phenol protons are usually around 7-10 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, a phenol's -OH would be around 5-7 ppm usually, unless it's strongly deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let's look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is 1H, which is a singlet and broad. That's more indicative of a carboxylic acid proton. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituents on the benzene are at the para positions, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, it would be a substituent at one position, and perhaps another group at another position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like a ketone or an ester, along with an alkyl chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a propiolic acid or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, and an alkyl chain that's branched. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is probably attached to an electronegative atom, perhaps a carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a propionyl group (CH2CO-) or something similar.

Wait, let me consider the splitting and the coupling. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH that's adjacent to another CH2 or similar. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to another CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is possibly part of a branch. So, putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2-C-O or similar.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible options. The options are all substituted benzenes, some with acid groups.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, and a propanoic acid group attached at the ortho position. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is something like 4-ethylbenzoyl acid or similar. Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propiono group attached.

Wait, another approach: after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think about the possible reaction outcomes.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydration of alkynes. Wait, no, that's with HgSO4 and H2SO4. Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe the reaction is a cleavage of a triple bond. Or, if the starting material is an alkyne, the reaction could result in a diol. Or, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation reaction.

Wait, alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used to effect the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne. The reaction of an alkyne with HI and red phosphorus can result in the formation of a carbonyl compound. Alternatively, I think that when an alkyne is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrohalogenation. Wait, but that's typically for alkynes, adding two equivalents of HI to form a diiodide. Hmm, but if the alkyne is present, adding HI in the presence of red phosphorus might lead to the formation of a ketone or an acid, depending on the structure.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material has a carbonyl group, then perhaps the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some kind of addition or cleavage. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a double bond. Suppose Compound X has a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group. Then, treatment with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some addition or cleavage. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on figuring out the structure of Compound X first, and then determine the reaction outcome.

Looking again at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely -COOH (carboxylic acid) because that's a strong broad peak around 10 ppm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the two substituents would be in the 1 and 3 positions? No, wait, para is 1 and 4. Wait, but if there's only one substituent, then the two protons would be in a certain pattern. Alternatively, maybe the para substituent is a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into two sets of doublets.

Wait, maybe the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. Or perhaps one substituent in the para position and another in the ortho, but that would complicate the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that has both a carbonyl and an alkyl chain.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, such as a benzoyl group, and an alkyl chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH group attached to a carbonyl, such as CH-CO-. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to the CH.

So maybe the structure is something like:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which implies that the CH3 is adjacent to a CH which has another neighboring group. So, perhaps it's a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a branched chain. So, for example, a structure like Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which would indicate a CH3 at the end of a CH2 group, like in an ethyl chain. So, the ethyl group would be something like CH2CH3, where the CH3 is at the end, giving a triplet when next to a CH2.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch this.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. So, the chain would be:

Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3 ?

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the CH3 in CH2CH3. So, the ethyl group is attached to a CH2.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the end methyl group of an ethyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to this methyl. Then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as in an isopropyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that wouldn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2. Hmm, but that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-2. So, the chain would be Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), meaning the CH3 is attached to a CH that's connected to another group. So, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propiono group (CH2CH2COOH), but that might not fit with the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group attached to a branched alkyl chain.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent on the benzene is a propanoic acid group. So, for example, the structure is benzene with a propanoic acid chain attached. Then, propanoic acid would have a -CH2CH2COOH group. Let me see if that fits the NMR.

But wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would correspond to the CH2 next to the COOH. But in propanoic acid, the CH2 adjacent to COOH would be split into a triplet if adjacent to another CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a ketone, like Ph-CO-R, where R is an alkyl chain, perhaps that fits.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH attached to a carbonyl group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH group, which is part of a branched structure.

So, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but that doesn't quite fit. Let's think again.

If the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, but then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 on the CH(CH3)2. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests that the CH3 is attached to a single CH group, which is split into a doublet due to coupling with that CH's protons.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the carbonyl. Let me think: Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal CH3 (0.9 triplet), a quartet for the middle CH2 (1.7?), but let me see.

Wait, in such a case, the CH2 adjacent to the CO would be a triplet (coupled with the next CH2), and the next CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH3). But the NMR shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, which might not fit a simple propyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the carbonyl. So, Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, but that doesn't match the NMR.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, these are all substituted benzene rings. Let me analyze each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the benzene ring has an ethyl group in the para position (since it's 4-ethylphenyl), and a propanoic acid group attached at the ortho position (position 2). So, substituents at 2 and 4 positions. The propanoic acid would be -CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so 1 and 4 would be the same as para positions. So, it's a para-substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups. But wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, numbering would give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, so perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted toluene derivative with an isobutyl group.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a sec-butyl group at the para position (4) and a carboxylic acid group (benzoic acid). So, substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). Wait, no, the numbering would have the COOH at position 1, and the sec-butyl at position 4, making them para to each other.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. Again, considering symmetry, this would be the same as having substituents at 1 and 4, which are ortho and para positions, but I'm not sure.

Now, looking back at the NMR and IR data of Compound X to match with these options.

The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl group. If it's a benzoic acid (option C), then the peak might be around 1700 cm-1, which fits. Also, the 10.5 ppm in the NMR would then be the carboxylic acid -OH proton, which makes sense.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is present only for option C and perhaps A, since they have carboxylic acids. The other options (B and D) are benzene rings with alkyl groups, so they wouldn't have a carboxylic acid proton, unless the IR and NMR suggest otherwise.

Wait, looking at the IR data again: the 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl, which could be from a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 3400-2500 region is a broad peak, which could be an -OH, such as from a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options, C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The NMR would then show:

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as only the two positions adjacent to substituents are present. Let me think: in para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring has substituents at 1 and 4. The H's at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H's at 3 and 5 would also be equivalent. Wait, no, wait. If the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl), then the ring would have H's at 2,3,5,6 positions. The H's at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The H's at 3 and 5 (meta to substituents) would be more upfield. But in the NMR data, there are two doublets: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which suggests that the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two each, which would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring would have substituents in para positions, making the H's at 2,3,5,6. But that would mean that each set of equivalent protons would be at 2 and 6, and 3 and 5. So, each set would show as a doublet, perhaps, if there's coupling between adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, making the structure such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's imagine the structure of option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to the COOH group and para to the sec-butyl. The H's at 3 and 5 are meta to both substituents. So, in the NMR, the H's at 2 and 6 would be more deshielded (higher ppm) and appear as a doublet, and the H's at 3 and 5 would be more shielded (lower ppm) and also appear as a doublet. That matches the NMR data given: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H).

Then, looking at the other NMR signals:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) corresponds to the CH in the sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, but no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, no: the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)-, but actually, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, attached to the benzene. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: Butyl groups. A sec-butyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait. The butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, butyl is four carbons. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct. Wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's five carbons. No, wait, butyl is four. So, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, that would be five. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? No. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the four carbons of the butyl group.

A primary butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached to the ring.

A secondary butyl group (sec-butyl) would be CH(CH2CH3)CH2 attached, but wait, that would be a five-carbon group. Hmm, no, maybe it's CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's three carbons. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So, the correct sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3), which is four carbons. Wait, no, that's five. Hmm, perhaps I'm messing this up. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a particular way. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group, which is a four-carbon group with branching. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that's three carbons attached to the benzene, but the isobutyl group is a four-carbon group: the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: the isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the NMR.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the correct structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's four carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? I'm getting stuck on this, perhaps I should move on.

In any case, the NMR shows signals that could correspond to a sec-butyl group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH in the sec-butyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the methyl group of an ethyl chain, but that doesn't fit with a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group.

Wait, let's look at the NMR signals. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is part of an ethyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to that. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, putting it all together, the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group. The NMR would show:

- The CH in the sec-butyl group (CH(CH3)2) would have a triplet or some splitting, but in the data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 groups would show up as multiplets as well.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let me imagine the substituent as a propyl group attached via a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If Compound X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a double bond, perhaps the reaction is an addition or cleavage of that double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in Compound X is a ketone, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is a hydrohalogenation.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave a triple bond. So if Compound X has a triple bond, the reaction would add HI across it, possibly leading to a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but if Compound X is a benzene ring with a propargyl group attached to a carbonyl, then adding HI and red phosphorus would add across the triple bond, forming a diol or a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propargyl group (CH2C≡CH), and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would cleave the triple bond, adding two HI molecules. That would form a diiodide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2CH=CH2), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would lead to hydrohalogenation. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in Compound X is an alkyne which, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, forms a geminal dihalide, which then could undergo elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's assume that Compound X is a benzoyl derivative with a substituent that, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, would form one of the options given.

Looking at the options, options B and D are benzene rings with isobutyl and methyl groups. Options A and C are benzene rings with propanoic acid or sec-butyl groups.

If Compound X is a benzoyl chloride or something similar, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group, leading to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, think about the reaction: if Compound X has a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus could lead to a dihalide or some other product.

Wait, perhaps the structure of Compound X is a benzene ring with a propenoyl group (CH2CH=CHCO-), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a carbonyl, making it a ketone with a double bond. Let's imagine it's Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propanoyl group. Then the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the CO. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH2 adjacent to CO, but that's a triplet typically.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options again and see which one makes sense with the NMR and IR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The IR would have a strong peak at ~1700 cm-1 for the carboxylic acid carbonyl, which matches the 1720 cm-1 peak. The 3400-2500 cm-1 peak would be the broad -OH of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 make sense for a benzene ring.

The NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which fits the data. The 10.5 ppm peak is the carboxylic acid -OH.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have the following NMR signals:

- The CH in the sec-butyl group (CH(CH3)2) would appear as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 groups would appear as multiplets around 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The methyl groups attached to the CH would appear as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H each, but integrated as 3H in total?), but wait, the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which suggests a single CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. That would fit the sec-butyl group's CH(CH3)2, where each methyl is attached to the CH. Wait, but in the sec-butyl group, the CH has two methyl groups attached, so each methyl group would be a triplet due to coupling with the CH. But the NMR shows a doublet for 3H, which suggests that the methyl is attached to a CH which is split by neighboring protons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the substituent structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2 in the isobutyl group) would be a quartet or triplet, depending on coupling.

- The CH(CH3)2 would be a septet, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a t-butyl group, but that doesn't match the NMR either.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. The NMR would show a triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH3), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (CH2), and a triplet at 2.9 ppm (CH). But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data for Compound X includes:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

These signals suggest a chain of:

CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 next to the benzene as a triplet (around 1.7 ppm, 2H), the CH(CH3) as a multiplet (2.9 ppm, 1H), and the terminal CH3 as a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would then be another methyl group attached to the CH. But that doesn't fit because the CH would have two CH3 groups attached, making it a CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the NMR would show a septet for the CH, but in the data, it's a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the carbonyl, making it Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to CO as a triplet (coupled with the next CH2) at around 2.4 ppm, but the data shows 2.9 ppm, which is more upfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else, but that's probably not relevant here.

I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let me try another approach. Once I have the structure of Compound X, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Assuming Compound X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a double bond, the reaction might add HI across the double bond, leading to a dihalide or some other structure. Alternatively, if the substituent is an alkyne, it might add two HI molecules to form a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, but another possibility: if Compound X is a benzoyl chloride, but that's probably not the case based on the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the carbonyl. For example, Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the options. The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think about the reaction conditions.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used to cleave triple bonds. For example, in the presence of an alkyne, the reaction can add two equivalents of HI, producing a vicinal dihalide. Alternatively, if the triple bond is part of a propargyl group, it might add HI across it.

Wait, but if Compound X has a triple bond, then the reaction would add HI across the triple bond, converting it into a diiodide. However, in the product options given, there's no indication of iodide groups. Therefore, perhaps the reaction is a hydration reaction, where the alkyne is converted into a ketone or an acid.

Wait, another thought: if Compound X is a propargyl benzoate, for example, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might hydrate the alkyne into a ketone. Alternatively, if it's a propargyl chloride, the reaction would add HI to form a diiodide.

Wait, but if the substituent is a triple bond, the product after adding HI would have a diiodide, which would then perhaps undergo elimination or further reaction. But the options don't seem to have iodide groups, so perhaps the reaction leads to a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrohalogenation of an alkene. If Compound X has a double bond, the reaction with HI would add across the double bond, forming a dihalide or a halogenated product.

Wait, but the options don't show any halogenated products, so perhaps the reaction is a hydration of an alkyne, forming a ketone or an acid.

Wait, the problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think that the reaction is the addition of HI to a triple bond, converting it into a diiodide. But I'm not seeing how that would relate to the options given. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a triple bond, adding HI across it. For example, an alkyne (R-C≡C-R') would react with HI to form R-I and R'-I, but that doesn't directly apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the alkyne, but that usually uses HgSO4 and H2SO4 (acidic conditions), not red phosphorus and HI.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction part, so perhaps I should proceed with the structure of Compound X. Based on the NMR and IR data, the structure seems to be a benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a CH group, a CH2, and a CH3 group. So, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. 

Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Maybe the substituent (sec-butyl) doesn't react, and the reaction occurs elsewhere. Or perhaps the substituent has a double bond that reacts.

Wait, but if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a saturated alkyl chain, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve it. Therefore, the product would be the same as the starting material, but that doesn't make sense because the question says it reacts.

Wait a minute, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group or another structure with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), and the reaction adds HI across the double bond.

Let me think: if the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene, then the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH=CH2. Reacting this with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the double bond, forming Ph-CH2-CHI-CH2I. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoyl group (Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a benzoyl group with a propenyl substituent. So, Ph-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the double bond, leading to Ph-CO-CH2-CHI-CH2I, but again, that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, the reaction could be the hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne to form a ketone. So, if the substituent is a propargyl group (Ph-C≡C-CH2-), then the reaction would form a ketone. But the options don't have a ketone; instead, they have benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

I think I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Based on the NMR and IR data, the most likely structure for Compound X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. 

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, benzoic acid is generally resistant to such reactions unless there's a functional group that can react. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a saturated alkyl chain, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect it. So, maybe the product remains the same, but that can't be the case because the question states that a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a double bond that reacts. For example, if the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), the reaction with HI would add across the double bond, forming a dihalide. But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is saturated. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent, but maybe the carbonyl group undergoes some reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the carbonyl group. For example, in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, heating with a strong base and a hydrazine can remove the carbonyl group, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the benzoic acid, but that would require aqueous conditions, which aren't indicated here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the ester group, but the compound is a carboxylic acid, so that doesn't apply.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the product options.

The options are all substituted benzene rings, some with acid groups. So, the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI must lead to one of these structures.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction doesn't change the substituents, then the product would be the same as Compound X. But since the question says it reacts, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of something or the addition of HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to a carbonyl group, but I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the formation of an acid anhydride or another derivative, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a triple bond to form a carboxylic acid. For example, if the substituent is a propargyl group attached to the benzene, then adding HI could cleave the triple bond and form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's imagine the substituent is a propargyl group: Ph-C≡C-CH2-. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the addition of HI across the triple bond, forming Ph-CI-CH2-I. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is within the substituent, and the reaction cleaves it to form a carboxylic acid.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of the triple bond to form a ketone, leading to a benzoic acid derivative, but again, I'm not certain.

I think I'm going around in circles here. Based on the data, the structure of Compound X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction doesn't alter the substituent, but maybe the benzoic acid is converted into something else. But none of the options suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a triple bond in the substituent, leading to a longer chain. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I don't see how that applies here.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps the reaction adds HI across the double bond, converting it into a dihalide. But then the product would have a diiodide substituent, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrogenation of the double bond, but that usually requires a catalyst like Pd, not red phosphorus and HI.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the data, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, possibly from a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Indicate aromatic C=C stretching, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet around 10 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet likely corresponds to a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet suggests a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet indicates a terminal CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. This matches **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the cleavage of alkynes or hydrohalogenation of alkenes. However, in this case, the substituent on the benzene ring (sec-butyl group) is saturated and does not contain a double or triple bond. Therefore, the reaction likely does not alter the substituent or the benzene ring. The product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
Based on the IR, NMR data, and the reaction conditions, the correct answer is **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
