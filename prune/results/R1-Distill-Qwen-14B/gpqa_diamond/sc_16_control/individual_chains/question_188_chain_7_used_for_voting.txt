Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh, wait, wait. In a crystal structure, the interatomic distance is usually the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. But in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell isn't cubic; it's more like a cube that's been deformed. So the lattice parameters might not be the same in all directions. 

But in a rhombohedral crystal, I think the unit cell is defined by a, b, c which are all equal (a = b = c), and the angles between them are all equal too, so alpha, beta, gamma are all same, which is the case here, 30 degrees each.

Wait, but wait, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal, and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms? Or wait, no, wait. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the edge length, so a would be 10 Angstroms. But since it's rhombohedral, a, b, c are all equal, so a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in some cases, the interatomic distance could refer to the distance between nearest atoms, which in a crystal might not always be the lattice parameter. But in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√1, which is just a. So in this case, perhaps a is 10 Angstroms.

So, the question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(sqrt( h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles... )).

Wait, right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d^2 = (h²/a²)(1/(sin²α)) + ... no, wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... something with the angles) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Since it's rhombohedral, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies.

I recall the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

1/d^2 = (4/3) [ (h^2)(1/a^2) (sin^2 α) + (k^2)(1/b^2)(sin^2 β) + (l^2)(1/c^2)(sin^2 γ) ) / (1 + ... something with cosines? ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is more like:

d_{hkl} = (1/√( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... )) considering the angles.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the general formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The formula is:

d = (1 / sqrt( ( (h^2)/(a^2) ) + ( (k^2)/(b^2) ) + ( (l^2)/(c^2) ) + ( ... terms involving hk, kl, lh and the cosines of the angles ... ) ))

Right, so in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say 10 Angstroms). The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees.

But wait, for a rhombohedral unit cell, the angle between the edges is given. So, in terms of the Miller indices hkl, the formula for d is:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/a^2 + 2(hk cos γ)/(a^2) + 2(hl cos β)/(a^2) + 2(kl cos α)/(a^2)

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a general triclinic system is:

1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2hk cos α/(a b) - 2hl cos β/(a c) - 2kl cos γ/(b c)

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So substituting these into the formula:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/a0² + 2 h k cos α / a0² + 2 h l cos β / a0² + 2 k l cos γ / a0²

Wait, but wait the signs. Wait, the general formula is:

1/d² = (h²)/(a^2) + (k²)/(b^2) + (l²)/(c^2) - 2 hk cos α/(a b) - 2 hl cos β/(a c) - 2 kl cos γ/(b c)

So in rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So substituting:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a0² - 2 hk cos(30°)/(a0²) - 2 hl cos(30°)/(a0²) - 2 kl cos(30°)/(a0²)

So factor out 1/a0²:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 hk cos(30) - 2 hl cos(30) - 2 kl cos(30) ] / a0²

Hmm, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging h=k=l=1:

1/d² = [1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1)(1) cos(30) - 2*(1)(1) cos(30) - 2*(1)(1) cos(30)] / a0²

Let me compute the numerator:

3 - 2*cos(30) - 2*cos(30) - 2*cos(30)

That's 3 - 6 cos(30) 

Cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660

So cos(30) ≈ 0.8660

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196

So numerator is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196

But wait, that can't be right because 1/d² can't be negative. So I must have messed up the signs in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is different. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think I messed up the signs. Let me double-check the formula.

Another approach: The interplanar distance for a crystal can be found using the formula derived from the unit cell parameters.

For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos(180 - γ) + 2 hl cos(180 - β) + 2 kl cos(180 - α) )

Wait, because the angle between the edges is the angle between a and b, which in rhombohedral is 30 degrees. But wait, wait. Wait, in some derivations, the angles used are the angles between the lattice vectors, which in rhombohedral are 30 degrees. But in the formula, perhaps we use 180 - angle, because the formula uses the angles in the lattice as the angles between the edges, which could be different.

Wait, I think I might have confused the angles. Let me clarify.

In the formula, the angles α, β, and γ are the angles between the edges of the unit cell. So for a rhombohedral system, α is the angle between b and c vectors, β between a and c, and gamma between a and b. So for a rhombohedral structure, all are same, 30 degrees.

But in the formula, sometimes the angles used are the supplementary angles, so 180 - alpha, etc.

Wait, another way: perhaps the formula uses the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors. So if the angle between a and b is alpha, then cos(alpha) is used. But in some cases, especially when the angle is acute, the formula might involve cos(180 - alpha), which is -cos(alpha). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. But since I can't do that right now, I'll think through.

Wait, okay, perhaps the correct formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cos(180 - alpha) + 2 hl cos(180 - beta) + 2 kl cos(180 - gamma) ) * (1/a^2) )

Wait, no, perhaps the denominator is [ h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ) ] / a².

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos(alpha) + 2 hl cos(beta) + 2 kl cos(gamma) )

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because in a cubic system, all angles are 90 degrees, so cos terms become zero, and the formula reduces to a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

So, in this case, our system is rhombohedral, so a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So, substituting into the formula:

d_{111} = a / sqrt( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) )

Compute the denominator:

sqrt(3 + 2 * cos(30) * 3 )

Wait, wait. Let's compute:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

The cross terms: 2 hk cos(alpha) = 2 *1*1 * cos(30), similarly for the other terms.

So 2 hk cos(alpha) = 2 *1*1 * cos(30)
2 hl cos(beta) = 2 *1*1 * cos(30)
2 kl cos(gamma) = 2 *1*1 * cos(30)

So each of the three cross terms is 2 cos(30). So total cross terms are 3 * 2 cos(30) = 6 cos(30)

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6 cos(30)).

So,

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2)) )

Because cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So,

= sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2) )
= sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Let me compute 3√3 ≈3 *1.732 ≈5.196

So 3 +5.196 =8.196

So denominator = sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.490 Angstroms?

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute, interplanar distances are usually smaller than the lattice parameter. Wait, but the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the (111) planes have an interplanar distance of a/√3 ≈5.77 Angstroms. So my calculation gave 3.49 for a=10, which would be a=10, so 10/2.863≈3.49. That's even smaller than the simple cubic case. But the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So that's a problem.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used 180 - 30 = 150 degrees for the angles. Because sometimes the angle in the formula is the angle between the vectors, and for a rhombohedral structure, the angles between the vectors are actually 180-30=150 degrees.

Wait, wait that's possible. Because in the unit cell, the vectors are arranged such that the angle between a and b is 30 degrees, but perhaps in the formula, the angle used is the angle between the reciprocal vectors or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the edges, which are 180 - the given 30 degrees. Because sometimes in crystallography, the acute and obtuse angles are considered, and the formula uses the obtuse angle (150 degrees) in this case.

Let me recalculate with alpha=150 degrees.

So, cos(150 degrees) is cos(180-30) = -cos(30) = -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So, substituting into the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos(150) )

Compute cos(150) = -√3/2.

So,

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 6*(-√3/2) )

= sqrt(3 - 3√3 )

But 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be inside the square root. That can't be right. So that's impossible. So perhaps using 150 degrees is also incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell to find the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

Wait, but since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(cos^2 30) + 2*(cos 30)^3 )

Compute cos^2(30) = (3/4) = 0.75.

So,

1 -3*(0.75) =1 -2.25= -1.25

2*(cos 30)^3 =2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )= 2*(3*sqrt(3)/(8)) )= (3 sqrt(3))/4 ≈1.299

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt( (-1.25) +1.299 )= a^3 * sqrt( 0.049 )= a^3 * 0.2215

So V≈10^3 * 0.2215= 221.5 Angstrom^3.

But not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by d= (a^2)/(h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )^(1/2)

Wait, perhaps that's another version. Let me check:

Wait, the formula I found elsewhere (in my mind) is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... other terms involving cosines.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 h k cos gamma + 2 h l cos beta + 2 k l cos alpha ) / (a²)

Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, so the formula simplifies.

So for (111), h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1 cos gamma + 2*1*1 cos beta + 2*1*1 cos alpha) / a²

But alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

1/d² = (3 + 2 cos 30 + 2 cos30 + 2 cos30 ) / a^2

= (3 + 6 cos30 ) / a²

Wait, that's the same as what I did earlier. But that's leading to a negative when using 150 degrees, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm missing a sign.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angles as 180 - alpha, so cos(alpha) becomes cos(180 - alpha) = -cos(alpha).

Wait, let me try that. So, if the angle in the formula is 180 - alpha.

So,

1/d² = (3 + 6 cos(180-30) ) / a²

cos(150) is -√3/2.

So,

1/d² = (3 + 6*(-√3/2) ) / (10)^2

= (3 - 3√3 ) / 100

But 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3-5.196= -2.196.

So 1/d² = (-2.196) / 100 → negative denominator, which can't be right.

So, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I need to get back to the basics.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + ... terms involving cos )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that involves the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by a matrix where g_ij = a^2 delta_ij + a^2 cos(theta_ij) for i=j, and g_ij= a^2 cos(theta_ij) for i≠j.

In a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor is:

g = [ [ a² (1 + cos alpha), a² cos beta, a² cos gamma ],
      [ a² cos beta, a² (1 + cos beta ), a² cos gamma ],
      [ a² cos gamma, a² cos gamma, a² (1 + cos gamma) ] ]

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, in rhombohedral, all the off-diagonal elements are a² cos(alpha), where alpha is 30 degrees.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The interplanar distance is given by:

d^2 = 1 / (h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2 hk g_12 + 2 hl g_13 + 2 kl g_23 )

So, for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal, the metric tensor will have:

g_11 = a² (1 + cos alpha )

g_22 = a² (1 + cos alpha )

g_33 = a² (1 + cos alpha )

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a² cos alpha

So, substituting into the equation for d^2:

d^2 = 1 / [ h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2 hk g_12 + 2 hl g_13 + 2 kl g_23 ]

So, for (111) plane,

d^2 = 1 / [ (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) g_11 + 2*(1*1) (g_12 + g_13 + g_23) ) ]

Wait, no, wait, because h, k, l are 1,1,1.

So,

h²=1, k²=1, l²=1.

g_11 = g_22 = g_33 = a² (1 + cos 30 )

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a² cos 30.

So,

d^2 = 1/[ (1+1+1) a² (1 + cos30) + 2*(1)(1) (a² cos30 + a² cos30 + a² cos30) ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the cross terms are 2 hk g_12, 2 hl g_13, and 2 kl g_23.

So for h=k=l=1,

the cross terms would be:

2*1*1* g_12 + 2*1*1* g_13 + 2*1*1* g_23

= 2 (g_12 + g_13 + g_23 )

But since all g_ij are a² cos30, except the diagonal.

Wait, no, g_12, g_13, g_23 are all a² cos30.

So,

sum of cross terms = 2 (a² cos30 + a² cos30 + a² cos30 ) 

= 2 * 3 a² cos30

=6 a² cos30

The sum of the square terms is (1+1+1) * a² (1 + cos30 ) =3 a² (1 + cos30 )

So,

d^2 = 1/[ 3 a² (1 + cos30 ) + 6 a² cos30 ]

=1/[ 3 a² (1 + cos30 + 2 cos30 ) ]

=1/[3 a² (1 + 3 cos30 ) ]

=1/(3 a² (1 + 3*(√3/2) ) )

So,

d= 1 / sqrt( 3 a² (1 + (3√3)/2 ) )

= 1/( a * sqrt(3 (1 + (3√3)/2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute the denominator.

First, compute 3√3 /2 ≈ (3*1.732)/2 ≈5.196/2≈2.598.

So,

1 + 2.598 =3.598

3 *3.598 ≈10.794

So,

sqrt(10.794)≈3.286

Then,

a =10, so denominator =10 *3.286 ≈32.86

So,

d =1/32.86 ≈0.0304 Angstroms.

Wait, that's way too small. But the options are around 9 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, this can't be right. I'm getting d around 0.03 Angstroms, but the options are 8-10. So I'm clearly doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for the metric tensor. Because another approach is to use the volume and the reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance formula is incorrect, and I should use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So, substituting for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(1 + 1 +1 + 2*1*1 cos30 + 2*1*1 cos30 + 2*1*1 cos30 )

Which simplifies to:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So,

3 + 6 *0.8660 =3 +5.196=8.196

sqrt(8.196)=2.863

So,

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are all in the 9-10 range. That doesn't match.

Wait, that suggests perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the (111) plane has d= a/√3. So for a=10, d=5.77, which is about 5.77 Angstroms. So the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the interplanar distance for a specific plane, but in this case, the question is about the (111) plane, but perhaps I've confused the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance given is the edge length a. But in reality, the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure is along the edges, so a would be the interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstroms.

Wait, okay, but why is the calculated d so small? Maybe the (111) plane is not the (111) in the conventional unit cell, but perhaps in the basis?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula and the correct d is larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d² as the terms I have.

So, for the (111) plane:

1/d² = (3 + 6 cos30 ) /a² 

cos30 ≈0.8660,

So,

3 +6*(0.8660 )=3 +5.196=8.196

So,

1/d²=8.196/(10)^2=8.196/100=0.08196 → d ≈sqrt(1/0.08196 )=sqrt(12.196)=3.49 Angstroms.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interplanar distance in a different way. Maybe the given interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter a, but the nearest neighbor distance. But in rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor distance is a, because each atom is at the corner of the cube. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have a denominator with (h² +k² + l² - ... ), but I can't think why.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2 kl cos(gamma) )

But if that's the case, then for (111), we'd have:

Denominator = sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Which would be sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Again, impossible.

So perhaps that's not it.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think of the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by h, k, l, and the interplanar distance is 1/(sqrt( ... )).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / [ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cos(180 - alpha) + 2 hl cos(180 - beta) + 2 kl cos(180 - gamma) ) ]

Because perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, let's try that.

So,

cos(180 - 30) = -cos30 ≈-0.866.

So,

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*1*1*(-0.866) *3 )

Wait, no. Let me compute:

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 2 hk cos(180 - alpha) + 2 hl cos(180 - beta) + 2 kl cos(180 - gamma) )

So,

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*1*1*(-cos30) + 2*1*1*(-cos30) + 2*1*1*(-cos30) )

= sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

= sqrt(3 -5.196 )=sqrt(-2.196). Again impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vector length.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are given by:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - hk (cos gamma) - hl (cos beta) - kl (cos alpha )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

The length squared of the reciprocal lattice vector is:

1/d² = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 )/(a²) + ... terms with cosines.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 )/(a^2) [1 + (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) ] - (hk (cos alpha) + hl (cos beta ) + kl (cos gamma )) / (a^2) )

Wait, that's getting complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck and look for another approach.

Wait, I recall that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² + l² ).

In a rhombohedral system, perhaps the formula is similar but with a factor involving the angles.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / [ sqrt( (h² +k² + l² ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(30) ) ]

Wait, but that's similar to what I did before. Let me compute.

For (111):

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(1 +1 +1)*cos30 )

= sqrt(3 + 6 *0.866 )

= sqrt(3 + 5.196 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863

So,

d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

Again, same result.

But the options are about 9 Angstroms, so something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way: the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos(150) ), but cos(150) is -0.866.

So,

Denominator= sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866 ))= sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is not the same as a. Wait, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". Oh! That's the distance between nearest atoms, which for a simple cubic structure is a. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor might be along a different direction.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not equal to the nearest neighbor distance. For example, in a hexagonal close-packed structure, the nearest neighbor is along a different vector, not a. So perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along a different direction, and a is larger than that.

But the question states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps a is 10 Angstroms. But then why am I getting such a small d?

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is a, but I'm miscalculating the formula. Because if a is 10, and d comes out to be about 3.49, which is much smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (1 1 1) plane in another way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the rhombohedral angles are not 30 degrees, but 180 -30 = 150 degrees. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles between the lattice vectors are considered as the angles you'd see in the unit cell, which could be 30 or 150, depending on convention.

If I take alpha=150 degrees, then cos(alpha)=cos(150)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So,

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 6 * (-0.866) )=sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should involve the inverse of a, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm really stuck. Let me think of the options. The options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. Wait, wait, maybe the formula gives d as a multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator.

Wait, let's compute 3 +6 cos30°.

Cos30°=√3/2≈0.8660.

So,

3 +6 *0.8660 =3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

d= a / sqrt(8.196) =10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are about 9 Angstroms. So maybe I'm calculating the reciprocal by mistake.

Wait, wait! Oh no, wait a minute! The formula I'm using is for the reciprocal, but perhaps I'm inverting it wrong.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is correct. So d=10 /2.863≈3.49.

But the options are way larger.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is not about the (111) plane in the unit cell, but in the reciprocal lattice. But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance in the (111) plane direction. But that's different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, but the interplanar distance for (111) is along a different direction, which is larger.

Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal of the formula. Hmm, but that would give me 2.863 Angstroms, which isn't the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses the reciprocal of (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ), but that's for cubic systems.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for a. For example, perhaps a is not 10 Angstroms, but something else.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So in a simple cubic, a=10, and nearest neighbor distance is 10.

In a rhombohedral, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is calculated differently. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest atoms might be at a distance of a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos30 ), but that's just a guess.

Wait, but that would be the distance between two atoms in adjacent unit cells, perhaps.

Wait, the distance between two atoms could be computed using the vectors a and b. Because the atoms are at the corners.

In a rhombohedral system, the vectors from the origin are a, b, c with angles 30 degrees between them.

So the distance between two nearest atoms is the magnitude of a - b? Or perhaps the vector from the origin to the next atom is a + b + c? No, wait, that's the body diagonal.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a direction that is a combination of vectors.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the unit cell. Each atom is at a corner, and the nearest neighbor is the one diagonally adjacent.

Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, which is a.

In a rhombohedral, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different direction, such as a diagonal.

Wait, perhaps the distance between two nearest atoms is given by sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos30 + 2a² cos30 + 2a² cos30 ) ?

Wait, that's for a face diagonal or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between two nearest atoms is along the (1,1,0) direction or similar.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along a different vector, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, so the (111) interplanar distance is as I calculated, 3.49 Angstroms, but that's not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system uses the sine of the angles.

Wait, but I can't recall it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the volume.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ )

In this case, α=β=γ=30 degrees, so:

V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3/8) )

Compute each term:

1 =1

3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25

2*(3/8)= 6/8=0.75

So,

V =a^3 * sqrt(1 -2.25 +0.75 )= a^3 * sqrt( (1 -2.25 +0.75) )

= a^3 * sqrt( (1 + (0.75-2.25) ) )

= a^3 * sqrt( 1 -1.5 )

= a^3 * sqrt( -0.5 )

Wait, that can't be right. So the volume can't be a real number. That suggests that the rhombohedral system with angles of 30 degrees is impossible, because the volume becomes imaginary. Which can't be true because the question gives such a system.

Hmm, that can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the formula for the volume.

Wait, correct formula for the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ )

Wait, for α=β=γ=30 degrees,

cos^2(30)= (3/4)=0.75.

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.75) )

= a^3 * sqrt(1 -2.25 +1.5 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (1 +1.5) -2.25 )

= a^3 * sqrt(2.5 -2.25 )

= a^3 * sqrt(0.25 )

= a^3 * 0.5

So, V= (10)^3 *0.5= 500 Angstrom^3.

Hmm, but that's the volume. How does that help me find the interplanar distance?

Another thought: The interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is given by:

( h, k, l ) in reciprocal space.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos(180 - alpha) + 2hl cos(180 - beta) + 2kl cos(180 - gamma) )

Wait, I think I tried this earlier and it leads to a negative.

But perhaps I should proceed regardless.

So,

h=k=l=1,

cos(180 -30)=cos(150)=-√3/2.

So,

Denominator= sqrt(3 + 2*(1)(1)* (-0.866) *3 )

= sqrt(3 + 2*(-0.866)*3 )

= sqrt(3 -5.196 )

= sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the options. Let's see what option B is: 8.95 Ang.

1/d²=1/(8.95)^2≈0.0119.

So,

Compute the denominator from the formula:

(3 +6 cos30 ) / a² = (3 +6*(0.866) ) /100= (3 +5.196)/100=8.196/100=0.08196.

So,

1/d²=0.08196, so d= sqrt(1/0.08196)=sqrt(12.196)=3.49 Ang.

But the option B is 8.95, which is 1/d²≈0.0119.

So,

(3 +6 cos30 ) /a²= (3 +5.196 )/100=8.196/100=0.08196.

Which is much larger than 0.0119.

So, perhaps the correct d is 3.49, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2 hk cos(60) )

Wait, for (111), that would be:

sqrt(3 - 2*(1)(1)*0.5 )=sqrt(3 -1 )=sqrt(2)=1.414.

So d=10/1.414≈7.07, which is still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) * (1 - cos^2 alpha ) )

But that's just a guess.

For (111):

d =10 / sqrt(3*(1 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ))=10 / sqrt(3*(1-3/4 ))=10 / sqrt(3*(1/4))=10/(sqrt(3/4 ))=10/( (√3)/2 )=20/√3≈11.547 Angstroms. But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 )^(1/2) / (something).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the spacing between layers in a particular direction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is close to my initial calculation multiplied by a factor.

Wait, my initial calculation was d≈3.49 Ang, but the options are around 9.

Wait, 3.49 *2.6≈9. So perhaps I inverted a or something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem uses the inverse formula, so d=  1/(sqrt( (3 +6 cos30 ) ) ) * a.

Wait, no, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d = sqrt( (3 +6 cos30 ) ) / a.

So,

1/d= sqrt(8.196)/10=2.863/10=0.2863 →d≈3.49.

Still same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) ) / ( something involving cosines )

Wait, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 )/(a^2) - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2 kl cos(gamma) )

But for (111):

1/d² = (3)/(100) - 6*(0.866 )

=0.03 -5.196= negative. Impossible.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for alternative methods or think of the relation between the interplanar distance and the atomic radius.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the atomic radius. It only gives the interatomic distance (edge length a=10) and the angles.

I'm not sure. Perhaps I should go with the calculation I did, but the options don't match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the denominator.

Wait, wait. Perhaps I should compute the denominator as [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) + 2 hk cos(alpha) + 2 hl cos(beta) + 2 kl cos(gamma) ].

But with alpha=30 degrees, then:

Denominator= sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So,

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But options are 8.95 to 10.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150 degrees, but then the denominator would be sqrt(3 +6 cos150 ), which is sqrt(3+6*(-0.866 ))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplement of the angles, but the cos is taken as the same. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula for d is a / (sqrt( h² +k² + l² ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

But for (111):

d=10/(sqrt(3) + 6*cos30 )

=10/(1.732 +6*0.866 )

1.732 +5.196=6.928

d=10/6.928≈1.443 Angstroms, which is even smaller.

No, that's not matching the options.

Hmm.

After trying all possible approaches and not finding a match with the options, I'm starting to think that perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula, and perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstroms.

Wait, how? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) - 2 hk cos(60) ) )

Wait, cos60=0.5.

So,

Denominator= sqrt(3 - 2*(1)(1)*0.5 )=sqrt(3 -1 )=sqrt(2)=1.414.

d=10/1.414≈7.07 Angstroms, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) ) / ( sqrt(3) )

But that would make d=10*sqrt(3)/sqrt(3)=10 Angstroms, which is option D.

But why would that be the case? It doesn't fit any formula I know.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is simply a, which is 10 Angstroms, option D.

But in simple cubic, (111) would have d=5.77, which is much smaller. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l² ) ) / (something else). For example, perhaps the formula in a rhombohedral system is d= a/(sqrt( (h² +k² + l² ) + 2 hk + 2 hl + 2 kl )) )

Which for (111) would be:

sqrt(3 +6 )=3, so d=10/3≈3.33.

No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) / (something).

Not sure.

After trying all these approaches and not finding a match, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Since my calculation gives 3.49, but that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstroms.

Wait, how?

Another Idea: Perhaps the rhombohedral system is actually a cubic system with a different metric. Because if the angles are 30 degrees, but I'm using the cubic formula, which assumes angles are 90 degrees.

But that would lead to d= a/sqrt(3)=5.77, which is not matching any option.

Hmm.

Another Approach: Perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the face-centered cubic formula.

Wait, but the structure is rhombohedral, not fcc.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) ) / (sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) ) )

But that sounds made up.

Wait, for (111), h+k+l=3, hk +hl +kl=3.

So denominator= sqrt(9 -6 )=sqrt(3)=1.732.

So d=10*sqrt(3)/1.732=10*1.732/1.732=10 Angstroms.

Which is option D.

But I don't know the basis for this formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstroms, which is close to 10 * sqrt(3)/2=8.66, but not exactly.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866, so 10*0.866=8.66. But option B is 8.95, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d= a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) - 2 hk cos(60) )

So,

sqrt(3 - 2*1*1*(0.5) )=sqrt(3-1)=sqrt(2)=1.414.

d=10/1.414≈7.07, not an option.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches without success. I'll have to make an educated guess. The only option close to my calculation when using 180-30 is not possible, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstroms.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}{a^2} + \frac{2hk \cos \gamma}{a^2} + \frac{2hl \cos \beta}{a^2} + \frac{2kl \cos \alpha}{a^2}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and substituting \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \frac{1 + 1 + 1}{a^2} + \frac{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ}{a^2} + \frac{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ}{a^2} + \frac{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ}{a^2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \frac{3 + 6 \cos 30^\circ}{a^2}
\]

Since \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), the numerator becomes:

\[
3 + 6 \cdot 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \frac{8.196}{10^2} = \frac{8.196}{100} = 0.08196
\]

\[
d_{111} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{0.08196}} = \sqrt{12.196} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result, however, does not match any of the provided options, which are all significantly larger (8.95–10.05 Å). This suggests a possible issue with the interpretation of the problem or the formula. One plausible explanation is that the interatomic distance given might not directly correspond to the lattice parameter \( a \), or the formula might need adjustment for the specific crystallographic context.

Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the options, an educated guess is made based on the closest plausible value. Among the options, \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \) (Option B) aligns most closely with the expected range for interplanar distances in such systems.

Answer: B
