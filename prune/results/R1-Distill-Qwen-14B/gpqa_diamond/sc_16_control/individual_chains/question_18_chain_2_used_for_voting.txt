Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are given, but maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here since the question is about elemental ratios in their photospheres. Oh right, the problem states that we're using the Equivalent Width (EW) method and LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) to determine the abundances.

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given for Fe and Mg. For Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, let me parse that. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 implies that log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait a second. The Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So that's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, let me make sure. The way the question states the Sun's composition is for 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that's log10(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, because I remember that in the Sun, the abundance of Fe is about 7.5 in terms of [Fe/H], but I might be mixing things up. Oh but in this problem, the Sun's [Fe/H] is just given as part of the calculation, so I should just use the provided numbers.

So Sun's Fe/H: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, Sun's Mg/H: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but what about the other elements? The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. Oh right, so I need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

But wait, the given data doesn't directly give [Si/H] for either star, but it gives [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2. So I need to relate these to find the silicon abundance in each star.

Let me think about each star one by one.

Starting with Star_1:
We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex. So that means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, no, because the [Fe/H] is a logarithmic scale. The [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 = 0, then log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun / nH_sun).

Which means nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5 as calculated earlier. So in Star_1, nFe_1 / nH_1 is the same as the Sun's, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the way the problem is phrased, the [Fe/H] is given as 0, which means that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun for Star_1.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3.

So, log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

Which implies nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But wait, I don't know the Sun's [Si/Fe], but perhaps it's provided elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Wait, let's think about the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Since the Sun's [Fe/H] is given, but [Si/Fe] would relate silicon to iron.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but for the Sun, as given earlier, nFe_sun/nH_sun is 3.16e-5.

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1. But wait, for the same star, the H density, nH_1, would be the same as the Sun's nH_sun times some factor, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the logarithmic abundances.

Wait, perhaps I should define each abundance in terms of the Sun's.

Let me define:

For Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance same as Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

So in the Sun: nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (some value). But I don't have that value, but perhaps I can calculate it using the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Sun's [Si/Fe] using the given nFe and nMg. Wait, but the Sun's data provided are nFe and nMg, but not nSi. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should make an assumption that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, but that's probably not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using other data, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in each star in terms of their Fe and Mg abundances, using the given ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should approach each star separately.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

But wait, the [Si/Fe]_sun is log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). So if I can calculate that, I can find nSi_1/nFe_1, and then multiply by nFe_1 to get nSi_1.

But wait, I don't have nSi_sun. Hmm. So maybe I need to find it from the given data.

Wait, looking back, the problem provides Sun's nFe and nMg, but not nSi.

Hmm, perhaps I can assume that nSi_sun is known, but I don't think it's given. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it through [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

Wait, perhaps I can find nSi_sun using the [Mg/Si] ratios. Let me see.

Wait, the problem states that Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si] = 0.3. But Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, meaning Mg/H is same as Sun.

So, for Star_2:

nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun → because [Mg/H]_2=0.

And [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3.

So, nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But since nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

Hmm, perhaps this can be linked with Star_1's [Si/Fe].

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is what we're looking for.

So, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

So, maybe I can express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their Fe and Mg, then find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances and then find the ratio.

Let's try that approach.

Starting with Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 → but perhaps since H is the same for all, maybe I can normalize everything to the Sun's H.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in each star, nH is the same as in the Sun, but that's probably not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express all abundances relative to H.

Wait, perhaps let's define for each star:

nX_i / nH_i = 10^{[X/H}_i} * (nX_sun / nH_sun).

Wait, because [X/H]_i = log(nX_i/nH_i) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So, nX_i/nH_i = 10^{ [X/H}_i + log(nX_sun/nH_sun) }.

Wait, no, wait: [X/H]_i is log(nX_i/nH_i) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So, log(nX_i/nH_i) = [X/H]_i + log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So, nX_i/nH_i = 10^{ [X/H]_i + log(nX_sun/nH_sun) }.

Which can be written as (nX_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{ [X/H]_i }.

So, for Star_1:

nFe_1/nH_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{ [Fe/H]_1 }.

Which, since [Fe/H]_1 =0, becomes (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *1.

Similarly, for Star_1's [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

Thus,

nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated. Let me try to express nSi_1 in terms of nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * nFe_1.

From above, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

And nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3} * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So, nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2.

Putting this into the equation:

(nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH_2) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Solving for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH_2) / ( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3} )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) / 10^{0.3}.

So, nSi_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2 / 10^{0.3}.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this part. Let me check the algebra again.

Wait, let's go back. For Star_2:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

And from [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:

nMg_2 / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

Substituting nMg_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH_2 ) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )

The nMg_sun cancels out:

nSi_2 = (nH_2) / (nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun) ) / (10^{0.3} )

So,

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun * nH_2 ) / (nH_sun * 10^{0.3} )

Hmm.

Now, let's compare nSi_1 and nSi_2.

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_1 * 10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2 / 10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2) is:

[ (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_1 * 10^{0.3} ] / [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2 / 10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

nH_1 * 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} / nH_2.

Which is (nH_1 / nH_2) * 10^{0.6}.

Because 10^{0.3} times 10^{0.3} is 10^{0.6}.

But wait, I don't know nH_1 or nH_2. Hmm, but perhaps I can relate them through the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun ). Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

But wait, how does that help me with finding nH_1 and nH_2?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2) can be found through other means, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me think differently. Maybe the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but that's probably not correct because the stars have different masses and hence different H content, but perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H abundance is the same as in the Sun. But that seems unlikely because the problem gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], so that would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's a valid assumption here.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Oh! The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

But in each star, the ratio nX/nH is determined by their [X/H]. So perhaps I should express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their [Si/H] and the Sun's [Si/H].

Wait, let's compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We can find [Si/H]_1 using [Si/Fe]_1 and [Fe/H]_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun )=0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun ) → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun ).

Wait, maybe another approach. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun ).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about [Si/H]_1.

[Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun).

But nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * nFe_1 * 10^{0.3}.

Because [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ).

So, nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) * nFe_1.

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun ), due to [Fe/H]_1=0.

Substituting:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) * nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

Simplify: 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Which means,

log(nSi_1/nH_1 ) = log(10^{0.3}) + log(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Thus,

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) = 0.3.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun ). So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → which is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

Similarly, let's compute [Si/H]_2.

But for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 =log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun )=0.3.

Which means,

log(nMg_2/nSi_2 )=0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun ), since [Mg/H]_2=0.

So,

nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun ).

Substituting into the equation:

log( [nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun ) ] / nSi_2 ) = 0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Which can be rewritten as:

log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) * (nH_2/nH_sun ) /nSi_2 ) = 0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

So,

[Mg/H]_2 = log(nMg_2/nH_2 ) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun )=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2 )=log(nMg_sun/nH_sun ) → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun )

Also,

[Mg/Si]_2 = log( nMg_2/nSi_2 ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun )=0.3

So,

log( nMg_2/nSi_2 ) = 0.3 + log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Which is,

nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Substituting nMg_2:

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun ) /nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides,

(nH_2/nH_sun ) /nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (1/nSi_sun )

Rearranging for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nH_2/nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

Now, let's find [Si/H]_2:

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Substituting nSi_2 from above:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) / 10^0.3

So,

nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun )/(nH_sun * 10^0.3 )

Thus,

log(nSi_2/nH_2 ) = log(nSi_sun/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) - log(10^0.3 )

Which is,

log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) - 0.3

So,

[Si/H]_2 = [log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) -0.3 ] - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) = -0.3

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, now, we have:

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3

[Si/H]_2 = -0.3

Now, the question is to find the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

But for that, we need to relate nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their [Si/H].

Since [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_1

nSi_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_2

So, the ratio is:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_1 ] / [10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_2 ]

Simplify:

(10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

Which is 10^{0.6} * (nH_1/nH_2 )

But I don't know nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm, but perhaps I can find their ratio using the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun )

But how does this help with nH_1 and nH_2?

Wait, maybe I can express nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of the Sun's H and the stars' [X/H].

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (nH_1/nH_2) using the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] data.

Wait, perhaps not. This seems to be going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. That is, nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

But wait, that would imply that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0 → their Fe and Mg abundances are the same as the Sun, which is correct. But for their H, since the stars may have different H, perhaps this is not a valid assumption.

But maybe the problem expects this approach. So let's try it.

If nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun, then (nH_1/nH_2 )=1.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = 10^{0.6} *1= 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Which is approximately 4. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is e^{0.6 * ln10} ≈ e^{0.6 * 2.302585} ≈ e^{1.381551} ≈ 3.98, which is about 3.98, so ~4. So option A is ~3.9, which would be the answer.

But wait, is this correct? Because if I make the assumption that H is the same in both stars as in the Sun, then the ratio is 10^{0.6} → ~3.98.

But is there any other factor I'm missing?

Wait, earlier I found that [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So the ratio of Si in the two stars would be 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Wait, because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So the ratio (nX_i /nH_i ) = 10^{ [X/H]_i + log(nX_sun/nH_sun)}.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, [X/H]_i = log(nX_i /nH_i ) - log(nX_sun /nH_sun )

So, log(nX_i/nH_i )= [X/H]_i + log(nX_sun/nH_sun )

So, nX_i/nH_i = 10^{ [X/H]_i + log(nX_sun/nH_sun ) }.

Which is 10^{ [X/H]_i } * (nX_sun/nH_sun )

So,

nX_i = (nX_sun/nH_sun ) * 10^{ [X/H]_i } * nH_i.

So,

nX_i = (nX_sun/nH_sun ) * nH_i * 10^{ [X/H]_i }.

Thus, the ratio (nX_1 /nX_2 )= [ (nX_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_1 *10^{ [X/H]_1 } ] / [ (nX_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_2 *10^{ [X/H]_2 } ]

Which simplifies to (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^{ [X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2 }.

So for Si, this is (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^{0.6}.

But without knowing (nH_1 /nH_2 ), I can't proceed. So unless I can find nH_1 and nH_2, I'm stuck.

Wait, but the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Mg/H]_2=0. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] =0 → Fe/H is same as Sun. So, nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg_2= nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun )

But I don't have any other data to link nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio (nH_1/nH_2) using the abundances of other elements.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun )

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun )

But how can I relate this to anything else?

Wait, perhaps I can consider the H abundance in each star in terms of their mass. But I'm not sure. The problem doesn't give any information about the stars' sizes or other properties beyond their masses.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H variations and assume that [H] is the same in both stars as in the Sun. If so, then nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2=nH_sun → nH_1/nH_2=1.

Then, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2)=10^{0.6} ≈3.98 → option A.

But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 can be found via the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] of the stars, but I'm not seeing a direct way.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ratio of H in the two stars.

Wait, from Star_1's [Fe/H]_1=0, we have nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun )

Similarly, from Star_2's [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun )

But I don't think that's sufficient to find nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio (nH_1/nH_2) using the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] of the stars. But I don't see a connection.

Wait, unless I can find the ratio using the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] of the stars and the Sun's abundances.

Wait, perhaps but I don't see a way to link them.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that [H] is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Which would make nH_1=nH_sun and nH_2=nH_sun. Then, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is 10^{0.6}=3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is D) ~1.2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So nSi_1 /nSi_2.

We have:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2=10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_1

nSi_2=10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_2

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (10^{0.3} * nH_1 ) / (10^{-0.3} *nH_2 ) ) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )/(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Wait, the (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) terms cancel.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2= (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Which is 10^{0.6} * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Hmm, but without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, we can't find this ratio.

Wait, but perhaps I can find nH_1/nH_2 using the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as the Sun, so nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. Then, (nH_1/nH_2 )=1, and the ratio becomes 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But perhaps I should check what the Sun's [Si/Fe] is. Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as part of the data, but not the [Si/Fe]. So perhaps I should compute it.

Wait, the Sun's data:

nFe_sun/nH_sun =3.16e-5.

nMg_sun/nH_sun=1e-5.

But what about nSi_sun/nH_sun? Hmm, perhaps I can calculate it using the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun )=0 → which doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the question provides the Sun's [Mg/Si] as part of Star_2's data, but no, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Earlier, we found that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that nH_1/nH_2=1, leading to the ratio being ~3.98, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again about the [Si/H] approach.

nSi_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_1.

nSi_2=10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH_2.

So, the ratio is (10^{0.6} ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But unless I can find (nH_1/nH_2 ), I can't get the exact ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can find it using the fact that in Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun )

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2= nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun )

But what else can I use? Maybe the fact that both stars have their own [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I don't see a way to relate nH_1 and nH_2 without more data.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that H is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun, making the ratio 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio is 10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6}=3.98, regardless of H, but that's only true if the H in both stars is scaled the same way, which would be a special case.

So, given the options, and the calculation leading to approximately 3.98, the closest option is A) ~3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Star_1 Analysis**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex indicates that the silicon abundance relative to iron is 10^{0.3} times higher than in the Sun.
   - Using the relationship for [Si/H], we find that [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 dex, meaning the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen is 10^{0.3} times higher than in the Sun.

2. **Star_2 Analysis**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex implies that the Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex indicates that the magnesium abundance relative to silicon is 10^{0.3} times higher than in the Sun.
   - Using the relationship for [Si/H], we find that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex, meaning the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen is 10^{-0.3} times higher than in the Sun.

3. **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\Delta[\text{Si/H}]} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}
     \]
     where \(\Delta[\text{Si/H}] = [\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6\).
   - Assuming the hydrogen abundance relative to the Sun is the same in both stars (\(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1\)), the ratio simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The closest option to the calculated ratio is **A) ~3.9**.
