Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think out loud.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, pretty rigid with multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent bridgeheads? Or maybe on the same structure but different positions—like across from each other?

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Let me think—dehydrohalogenation? Since it's dibrominated, elimination could lead to forming a double bond. But on adamantane? Oh wait, that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are not allowed in norbornane systems due to Bredt's rule. So maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, but wait. Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. KOH can cause substitution. However, substitution on bridgehead carbons is tricky because they're typically tertiary and might not undergo SN2 easily. Unless it's an E2 elimination. Oh, right! With two bromines, perhaps an E2 mechanism could occur, leading to the formation of an alkene. But wait, bridgehead alkenes are generally not favored due to the angle strain. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a double bond. But given that bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, perhaps the elimination isn't forming an alkene but something else.

Wait, wait, let's think about the product. The 1H NMR of product 1 has specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Oh, so maybe the reaction is not elimination but dehydrohalogenation with formation of a ketone.

Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone. But how? Oh, if both bromines leave, but that would require two deprotonations. But wait, how would that form a ketone?

Alternatively, think about a pinacol-like rearrangement. Pinacol is 1,2-diol, which upon treatment with acid forms a carbonyl. But here, maybe it's a similar process. Wait, no, in this case, the starting material is a dihalide. Oh, wait, could it be a haloform reaction? No, that's when you have a methyl ketone and excess base leading to CH3COOH and CO2, but that doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts protons leading to the formation of a conjugate base, which then eliminates the bromides. Wait, but with two bromides, perhaps the base causes elimination of two equivalents of HBr, resulting in a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH: maybe each bromine undergoes elimination, but how would that form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each dibromide undergoes elimination to form a double bond, but that's not possible for bridgehead carbons. Alternatively, perhaps each Br atom is replaced by an alkoxide, which then leads to some rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl, suggesting a ketone or ester. So the product might be an adamantanone, where one of the bridgehead carbons has a carbonyl group.

So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH, perhaps each bromide is replaced by an hydroxyl group. But wait, that would lead to a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Or maybe one Br leaves as Br-, and the adjacent position loses a proton, leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation. Each Br- is eliminated, but considering the structure, maybe each elimination leaves a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each C-Br to form a carbonyl, which would not be possible on adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but then the diol undergoes some kind of cyclization to form a ketone. Maybe elimination of water, but that's just a guess.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring or something else. But let's think about the H NMR. The signals would help.

The NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) – that's probably an -OH group or some oxygen-bearing protons, but since it's after KOH, perhaps it's an alcohol. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Wait, but 4.79 could be a CH2 that's adjacent to an oxygen. Or maybe it's an ethylene group (but that's usually around 5-6 ppm). Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanediol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. How could that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement. Wait, another possibility: the base could induce the formation of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone via a bridged structure. Maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination of two HBr molecules forms a ketone. So, each elimination would remove Br and H, leading to a double bond, but bridgehead double bonds are not possible. So perhaps instead, the two eliminations form a conjugated system, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require each Br to be replaced by a ketone, which seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double E2 elimination. Each Br leaves, taking a proton with it, leading to a double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so perhaps the structure forms a cyclopropane or another ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantane with a carbonyl group. If each Br is removed, perhaps the two adjacent bridgeheads lose Br and form a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's a ketone. Because the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is typical for a ketone.

So perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of an oxide.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two bromides undergo elimination to form a ketone. Because KOH is a strong base, perhaps two dehydrohalogenation steps occur, each leading to the loss of HBr and the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? For each dehydrohalogenation, you would lose HBr and form a double bond. But as bridgehead double bonds are not possible, maybe the two eliminations form a conjugated diene, but that's unlikely in adamantane structure. Alternatively, perhaps the two eliminations form a ring contraction or expansion, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each HBr elimination leads to a ketone. Let me imagine the structure. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, then elimination of HBr from each could form a carbonyl group on each of those carbons. But that would make a diketone, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, maybe both eliminations lead to a single carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would lead to a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. No, that would have an ether peak in IR around 1100-1250 cm^-1, but the given is 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider looking at the NMR data. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H) which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H) which could be a set of equivalent CH2 groups in the adamantane structure. 1.94 (2H) is perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the product. If the product is a ketone, it's in the adamantane structure. So maybe one of the bridgehead carbons is a carbonyl group.

Wait, so if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. How?

I think I need to visualize the structure. Adamantane has a structure like a diamond, with bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads.

Heating with KOH: perhaps an E2 elimination. Each Br is on a bridgehead. When KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, the Br leaves as Br- and a double bond forms. But bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so maybe the elimination leads to a ring contraction.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl. How? Maybe through a conjugated base. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination leads to a ketone.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a carbide, which then loses Br- to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me think: when KOH is heated with a dibromide, each Br could leave, but that's not possible. Alternatively, each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would require more than KOH. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of a peroxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is involved in an elimination to form a ketone. So for each Br, the base abstracts a beta-H, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since that's not possible, the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the loss of two HBr molecules and the formation of a ketone. So each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons each lose a beta-H, resulting in a carbonyl group.

But I'm not entirely clear on how that would happen. Maybe the adjacent C-Br and C-H are eliminated together, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then the diol undergoes some kind of dehydration to form a ketone.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it forms 1,3-adamantanediol. But then, heating that with KOH further could lead to dehydration, forming a ketone. But how would diol dehydration form a ketone?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of the diol hydroxyl groups loses a proton to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. But that's more about carbocation shifts.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a reaction where two adjacent dihalides eliminate to form a carbonyl. I remember that in some cases, adjacent dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone.

Wait, yes! I think I've heard of the formation of ketones from 1,2-dihalides. The reaction is called the dehydrohalogenation or the Schorigin reaction, where two adjacent halides eliminate to form a ketone. So in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl group between the two bridgehead carbons.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantandione? Or perhaps a single ketone group where the two bridgeheads were. Wait, but that's not possible because you can't have a single carbonyl where two bridgeheads were. Alternatively, perhaps each bridgehead loses a Br and a H, leading to a single ketone group.

Wait, let me think: if you have two adjacent bridgehead carbons each with Br, and KOH abstracts a β-H from each, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a double bond. But since bridgehead double bonds are not possible, perhaps the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are eliminated along with two H's, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, I think I'm getting closer. The reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules, and forming a ketone. So the product would be 1,3-diketone? Or perhaps a single ketone.

But wait, the product's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That doesn't fit a ketone, because a ketone doesn't have H attached. Hmm. Wait, the 4.79 ppm might not be the ketone. Oh wait, the IR is at 1720, which is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, the NMR for product 1: 4.79 (2H), maybe an -OCH2- group? Or a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group, but that's usually higher ppm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. But that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but that doesn't fit the IR either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone and an alcohol. So maybe it's a geminal diol, but that doesn't make sense with the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group that's next to oxygen. So in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) would be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol? No, because the IR is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, like 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid? No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1 (light yellow solid)

IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ → carbonyl.

NMR:
4.79 (2H) → maybe a CH2 adjacent to oxygen (like OCH2).
2.41-2.23 (10H) → probably CH2 groups in the adamantane structure.
1.94 (2H) → perhaps another CH2 group.

So, product 1 has a carbonyl group. How?

Maybe the base causes each Br to leave, and the adjacent CH2 groups combine to form a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that two Br's are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the two adjacent C's each lose a H, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single carbonyl group in the structure. Let's say, 1-adamantanone. But then the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is probably a CH2.

Hmm, maybe it's something else. Let me think about what 1,3-dibromoadamantane would look like. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. 1,3 positions would be two bridgeheads opposite each other? Or adjacent?

Wait, the actual structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two bromines are on bridgeheads that are not adjacent. Wait, no, in adamantane, the bridgeheads are arranged in a way that each bridge is connected to two bridgeheads. So 1 and 3 would be on opposite bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with my current understanding.

If I accept that product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's 1-adamantanone. Then, the NMR would have a peak for the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, 1-adamantanone would have the structure where one bridgehead is a carbonyl. So the NMR could have a peak for the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl.

But the 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an OCH2 group. Wait, but 1-adamantanone doesn't have an OCH2 group. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when KOH reacts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it forms a peroxide bridge. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone to begin with, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

I'm stuck on this first part. Let me try to proceed to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or some kind of acid catalyst-induced reaction.

Wait, product 1 has a ketone. So, when heated with Al(OR)3 (like Al(i-Pr)3), perhaps the ketone is converted into an acylium ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide is used for some kind of cyclization. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bromoalkene, but that's not matching the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl, and Al isopropoxide helps in some kind of elimination. Or maybe it's used for forming an enolate.

But without knowing product 1, it's hard to predict product 2.

Moving on, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3.

Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves double bonds. So, product 2 must have a double bond. When ozone is bubbled through a solution at low temperature, it forms ozonides, which upon work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) break into carbonyl compounds.

So, if product 3 is formed via ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, going back, product 2 is a compound with a double bond. So, perhaps product 1 was a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated ketone with a double bond).

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, how does product 2 get a double bond? Maybe through elimination.

Wait, let me try to outline the possible steps:

1) 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (a ketone)

2) product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (an alkene)

3) product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 3 is the result of cleaving a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and any remaining hydrogens would be on adjacent carbons. The most deshielded H would be near an electronegative atom, like a carbonyl.

But let me think about the structure.

Assuming product 2 is an enone (conjugated diene or a compound with a double bond adjacent to a ketone), ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is something like a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 2 is an alkene, perhaps formed via elimination from product 1.

Wait, but how would product 1 (a ketone) become an alkene? Maybe via a dehydration reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, but this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyls. But I'm not certain.

But let's try to think from the end. Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

If product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and any hydrogens adjacent to them would be deshielded.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be next to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring hydrogens.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H (likely adjacent to the carbonyl) would have coupling with neighboring H's. Let's say, for example, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the H's would be split by neighboring groups.

But perhaps the structure is such that each of these H's has two neighboring H's. For example, a CH2 group with two adjacent CH2 groups on either side, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to model this: suppose product 2 is a compound with a double bond, say between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups, A=O and B=O. Then, each of these would have adjacent CH2 groups.

If the structure is such that after cleavage, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, then each CH2 would have adjacent H's. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-O=C=O. Wait, no, that's more like a diester, but in reality, it depends on the original structure.

Alternatively, suppose the ozonolysis results in two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups. So, something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, in the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl, each H would be adjacent to two H's on the same CH2 and possibly more on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but each CH2 has two H's, and if they're adjacent to another CH2, the splitting would be as follows. Let me think: if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, the H's on the first CH2 would be split by the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have a triplet (n+1, where n=2).

Wait, more accurately, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, so each would be a triplet. But wait, if each H is split by two equivalent H's, it's a triplet. But if the adjacent group has more H's, perhaps it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure is a chain where a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, the middle CH2 would have neighboring H's on both sides. For example, CH3-CH2-CHO. No, that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a bridged bicyclic compound, and ozonolysis creates two ketones with CH2 groups adjacent to them. So, each CH2 next to a carbonyl would have neighboring H's.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the 1H NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, which is likely near a carbonyl group.

If the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and if that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each H would have two neighboring H's (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

Wait, but that's for a single adjacent CH2. Or, perhaps the H has two neighboring groups, each with a certain number of H's.

Alternatively, if the H is in a CH2 group that's between two other CH2 groups, the H's would be split by both adjacent CH2 groups. That would lead to a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet of triplets, or a doublet of triplets, etc.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO

But that's linear, and each CH2 would have neighboring H's. The central CH2 would have two H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H in the central CH2 would be split by two H's from each side. So for each H, the splitting would be (n+1)*(m+1), where n and m are the number of H's on each adjacent carbon.

Wait, but each adjacent CH2 has two H's. So each H would be split by two H's on one side and two on the other. So the splitting would be as follows: each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other. So for each adjacent group, it would multiply the splitting.

Wait, let's think of it as each H being split first by the two H's on the left, then by the two on the right. The first split would create a triplet, and the second split would create another triplet for each of those. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it might be a quintet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's are split by two neighboring H's in one direction and one in another, but that depends on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is a methine (CH) group, but the question says it's a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would be split by the two H's on the left and the two on the right. So the splitting would be (2+1) * (2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a nonet, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, if each H is split by two H's from one side and one H from the other, it would be a triplet of doublets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H is adjacent to two different sets of H's. For example, a CH2 group next to a CH group and a CH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe the H is in a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH group. Then, each H would be split by the two H's on one side and the one H on the other. So, for each H, the splitting would be (2+1)*(1+1) = 6 peaks, but that's a sextet, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, which is next to a CH group. So each H in the first CH2 would have two adjacent H's on one side (from the next CH2) and one on the other (from the CH group). So the splitting would be (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which is a sextet.

But none of the options are a sextet.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm.

Another possibility: the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H is coupled with two H's on one side (from the adjacent CH2) and one H on the other (from the CH group). So each H would split into a triplet (from two H's) and then each of those would split into a doublet (from one H), resulting in a triplet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the H is in a CH2 group that's between two CH2 groups. So each H is split by two H's on one side and two on the other. So each H would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are different, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets (option C), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is then adjacent to another CH2 group. So the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two H's, and each H would be split by two H's on one adjacent CH2 and maybe another H on another adjacent group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So the H's would be split into a triplet of triplets (option B).

But I'm not certain. Let me think of a specific example. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the central CH2 would have two CH2 groups on either side. Each H in the central CH2 would be split by two H's from each side. So the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2O=C=O)-, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone, like two ketones connected by some CH2 groups. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two H's. The H's on each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would couple with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 has two neighboring H's on one side and one on the other, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering the options, the most likely coupling pattern for a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups (each with two H's) would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but what's the actual splitting? Each H on the CH2 is coupled with two H's from one adjacent group and two from the other. So the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are different, leading to a more complex pattern. For example, if the H is split first by two H's (triplet) and then each of those is split again by two H's (another triplet), the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is split by two H's on one side and one on the other, it would be a triplet of doublets, which is option C. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: suppose the H is in a CH2 group that's between two different groups. For example, one side has a CH2 and the other has a CH. So each H would be split by two H's from the CH2 and one H from the CH. So each H would first split into a triplet (from two H's) and then each of those would split into a doublet (from one H), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is option C.

But none of the options have a triplet of doublets. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would be split by two H's on one side and one H on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH2 group that's next to a CH2 and a CH group. So each H would couple with two from the CH2 and one from the CH, leading to a triplet (from two) and then a doublet (from one), so a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options given are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the initial steps again. Maybe I can figure out product 1 first.

Going back: product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. The IR shows a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H). That's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps OCH2.

Wait, but a ketone doesn't have an OCH2 group. So maybe product 1 is a geminal diol. Wait, geminal diols are adjacent diols, but they are not stable and tend to form ketones via dehydration.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But the IR for an epoxide would show a peak around 1100-1200 cm^-1, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a secondary alcohol, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial reaction forms an enolate, which then tautomerizes to a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a quinone structure, but that would require conjugation.

I'm stuck on product 1. Maybe I should think about product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, maybe it's an aldol condensation forming an enone.

Wait, Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But product 1 is a ketone, which isn't typically reactive in Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, it could be used for some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide. Then, ozonolysis would break the epoxide into carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromoalcohol, and product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol with a bromide. Then, product 2 could be an alkene formed via elimination. But without knowing product 1, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the ozonolysis step.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, and product 3 is formed by cleaving that double bond. The most deshielded H in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

If that H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, the H's would be split into a triplet of triplets (option B) or a doublet of triplets (option C).

But considering that each CH2 group would have two neighboring H's, the splitting would be a triplet for each adjacent group. So if there are two adjacent CH2 groups, each H would be a triplet of triplets.

So the answer would be option B.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, forming a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).  
   - Based on the IR data, product 1 is identified as a ketone. The NMR data suggests the presence of a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom (likely OCH₂) and other CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in elimination or cyclization reactions.  
   - Given that product 1 is a ketone, product 2 likely contains a double bond formed via elimination, resulting in an enone (conjugated ketone with a double bond).

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is expected to contain carbonyl groups where the double bonds in product 2 were cleaved.

4. **Analysis of Product 3's ¹H NMR**  
   - The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding exchangeable protons.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - If this hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group between two other CH₂ groups, it would be split by the neighboring hydrogens. Each hydrogen in the CH₂ group would couple with two hydrogens on one adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet. If there is another adjacent CH₂ group, the splitting would occur again, leading to a triplet of triplets.

5. **Conclusion**  
   - The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
