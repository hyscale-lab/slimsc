Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Wait, wait. The options are talking about the blue ones, which I think are the tetra- or dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, I think Co with four SCN- is the blue one, like Co(SCN)_4^2- or something. Or maybe it's the dithiocyanato, meaning two SCN- ions? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the question specifically says "dithiocyanato" so that would be two SCN- ions.

Wait, but looking at the β values: β1 is 9, which would be Co(SCN)²+ maybe? Because βn is for the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]²+. β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^2+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2- perhaps? Or maybe the charges are different. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

But the key is the stability constants. So the problem is about determining the distribution of the different Co-SCN complexes in solution. Since the stability constants are given, we can use these to find the fraction of each complex.

So the approach is to consider all possible complexes and their formation based on the β values and concentrations. The idea is that the most stable complex (highest β) will dominate, but the concentrations of the ligand and metal also influence the distribution.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion. Alternatively, the fraction can be found using the β and the concentrations of ligand and metal. 

The formula for the fraction of a complex is (βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + ... + βn [L]^n). Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, the fraction for each species can be determined by their respective formation from the metal and ligand. 

Wait, the metal is Co²+ and the ligand is SCN⁻. Each complex will form stepwise. So the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}? Wait, no, charge-wise, each Co²+ binds n SCN⁻, so each adds a negative charge. So [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} would have charge 2+ - n(−) → 2−n. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe that's a detail I can set aside for now.

The main point is to calculate the distribution of each complex. Since βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, the fraction of each species depends on βn and the ligand concentration.

Wait, I think the formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (βn [L]^n) / (sum over m from 0 to 4 of βm [L]^m), where m is the order of the complex. Because each βm represents the formation of the mth complex.

But wait, the initial species is the free Co²+ (m=0), then each higher m is a higher complex. So the fraction of a particular complex is (βn [L]^n) divided by the sum of all βm [L]^m for m from 0 to 4.

Wait, but for m=0, β0 is 1, since it's the free ion. So the denominator becomes 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

So the fraction of the nth complex is (βn [L]^n) / denominator.

In our case, [L] is the concentration of SCN⁻, which is 0.1 M. And the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought β4 would be higher than β3 if the series keeps increasing. But here β4 is 16, which is less than β3 (63). So that suggests that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Hmmm, interesting. So the most stable complex is the third, [Co(SCN)_3]^2+? Or wait, no, because higher complexes may have higher β's.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm using the right βs. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the nth complex is ML^n, and the stability constant βn is Kf for that complex. So for each step, the formation is ML^n ⇌ ML^{n+1} + L. So the βn for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise formation constants up to that point.

Wait no, correction: the overall βn for the complex ML^n is the product of the stepwise formation constants. So βn = K1 * K2 * ... * Kn, where K1 is the first step, K2 the second, etc. So the βn increases up to a point and then may decrease if the next step is not favorable.

In our case, β1=9, β2=40 (which is 9* something), β3=63 (maybe 40* something else), and β4=16, which is less than β3. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Interesting.

So the maximum β is at n=3, so the third complex is the most stable. So the distribution will have the highest amount in the third complex.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, what's the blue one? I think the blue complex is the tetra- or dithiocyanato. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: I think Co(SCN)_2²+ is pink, and Co(SCN)_4²− is blue. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato (two SCN) is blue. Wait, I think the tetra is blue. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex. So that would be n=4. Hmm, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So if the blue complex is n=4, then its fraction would be lower, but maybe it's a higher complex.

Wait, but the question says 'blue dithiocyanato' which implies two SCN groups. So that's n=2. So [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be the species, with β2=40.

Wait, wait. So the blue dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}? Hmm, but I'm a bit uncertain about the exact color. But regardless, the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex, with β2=40.

So to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, I need to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} in the solution.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the denominator D = sum_{m=0}^4 βm [SCN]^m. 

Wait, but β0 is for the free Co²+ (uncomplexed), which is 1. Because [Co²+] is the starting point. So the denominator is:

D = β0 [L]^0 + β1 [L]^1 + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

But β0 is 1, [L] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

Compute each term m=0 to 4:

m=0: β0 * [L]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1

m=1: β1 * [L]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

m=2: β2 * [L]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4

m=3: β3 * [L]^3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

m=4: β4 * [L]^4=16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Now sum all these up to get D:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9
1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3
2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363
2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So D = 2.3646

The fraction of the m=2 complex is (β2 [L]^2) / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ approx 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but that's the fraction. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: ~16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex. But wait, the question is about the blue one. Let me double-check if the dithiocyanato is actually the blue complex or not.

Wait, I think the blue color is associated with the tetra-SCN complex. For example, [Co(NH3)6]^3+ is pink, but maybe in thiocyanato complexes, the tetra is blue. If that's the case, then the question is about the tetra complex, which is n=4, β4=16. So let's check that.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN groups. So the n=2 complex. So the calculation I did earlier would be correct. So the percentage is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, another thought: the sum D is 2.3646. The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 = approx 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that matches.

Wait, but wait. Another point to consider: the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. But in the calculation, I didn't use that. Why? Because the formation constants are used to find the distribution, and the total concentration factors into all species, so the fractions are based on the relative stabilities and ligand concentrations.

So the final percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants and ligand concentration provided. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as:

- \( \beta_1 = 9 \) (first complex, \([CoSCN]^{2+}\))
- \( \beta_2 = 40 \) (second complex, \([Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}\))
- \( \beta_3 = 63 \) (third complex, \([Co(SCN)_3]^{-}\))
- \( \beta_4 = 16 \) (fourth complex, \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\))

The ligand concentration is \([SCN^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), and the total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \). The fraction of each cobalt complex is determined using the formula:

\[
\text{Fraction of the nth complex} = \frac{\beta_n [L]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [L]^m}
\]

Here, \([L] = [SCN^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), and the denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_m [L]^m\) for \(m = 0\) to \(4\). The calculations for each term are as follows:

- \( m = 0 \): \(\beta_0 [L]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \( m = 1 \): \(\beta_1 [L]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \( m = 2 \): \(\beta_2 [L]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \( m = 3 \): \(\beta_3 [L]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \( m = 4 \): \(\beta_4 [L]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\(m = 2\)) is:

\[
\text{Fraction of } [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = \frac{\beta_2 [L]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of } [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
