Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and figure out what it's asking.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will modulate the brightness as observed from Earth, making the light curve vary periodically. The interesting part is that this setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the host star (Rstar) to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

The options are A to D, with numbers around 0.07 to 0.39. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to think about how both the spots and a planet would cause changes in the star's brightness. For the planet, it's the transit method: when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the formula for the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

Now, for the star with spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. But since the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view. The effect on the light curve would be a periodic dimming as the spots rotate into and out of the observed hemisphere.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet transit. So I need to find the Rpl/Rstar such that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as when a planet transits.

But wait, what's causing the variation in each case? For the planet, it's a dip in brightness as it blocks light. For the spots, it's a dip as cooler regions come into view, but the star's overall brightness changes as different parts (hot and cool) rotate into view.

Wait, perhaps I should model both scenarios. Let's think.

Case 1: Exoplanet transit. The change in brightness (delta F) is the area blocked by the planet divided by the area of the star. So delta F = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * Fstar, where Fstar is the star's flux.

Case 2: Star with spots. The star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into view. The maximum effect would be when the spots are fully visible, and the minimum when they are on the far side. The amplitude of the variation would depend on the total area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

Wait, but the star's total flux isn't just from the spots. The entire star emits, but the spots are cooler. So when the spots are in view, the total flux is slightly less than when they're not. So the variation in brightness is the difference between the star's flux when spots are visible and when they're not.

Let me get into the math here. The flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F_total = σTeff^4 * 4π Rstar^2, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when there are spots, part of the surface is at a lower temperature.

The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the star. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 4π Rstar^2.

The flux from the spots is F_spots = σ T_spot^4 * (0.2 * 4π Rstar^2) / (4π) ) = σ T_spot^4 * 0.2 Rstar^2. Wait, no, because the area is 0.2 * 4π Rstar^2, but each area element emits according to its temperature. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the effective temperature.

The effective temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same total flux as the star. But when the star has spots, the overall flux is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the difference in flux between when the spots are on the side facing us and when they're not.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and go out. The maximum brightness would be when the spots are on the far side, so their cooler flux doesn't contribute. The minimum is when the spots are on the near side, contributing their lower flux.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_max and F_min divided by F_max. Or wait, perhaps the amplitude is F_max - F_min, which would be the change in flux.

Wait, let's model it. The star has two regions: the spotted area (20% of the surface) at T_spot and the rest (80%) at Teff.

Wait, but wait, the star's overall effective temperature is Teff, which is when the entire surface is at Teff. When part of the surface is cooler, the total flux from the star decreases. But when the spots are not visible (e.g., when the star rotates so the spots are on the far side), the star's flux is F_total = 4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is (0.8 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ Teff^4 ) + (0.2 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ T_spot^4) ) all divided by 4π? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the flux from a blackbody is F = σ T^4. So for each part of the star's surface, the flux it emits is proportional to T^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F_visible = (Fraction_unspotted) * F_unspotted + (Fraction_spotted) * F_spotted.

Wait, but the unspotted part is 80% of the surface, so 0.8. Spotted is 0.2.

But wait, the star's entire surface emits, so when the spots are on the near side, the flux is:

F = (0.8 * σ Teff^4) + (0.2 * σ T_spot^4 )

But wait, the area is 4π Rstar^2, so each part is a fraction of that. So F_total = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * σ * 4π Rstar^2 / 4π.

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the correct way. Let me think again.

The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from each part. Each part's flux is F = σ T^4 * area. So for the unspotted part, the flux is 0.8 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ (Teff)^4. The spotted part is 0.2 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ (T_spot)^4.

Wait, no, because the area is a fraction of the total. So F_total is:

F_total = (0.8 * σ Teff^4 * 4π Rstar^2 ) + (0.2 * σ T_spot^4 * 4π Rstar^2 )

But wait, this would be the flux when the spots are on the near side. When the spots are on the far side, the flux is just from the unspotted regions: F_total = 0.8 * σ Teff^4 * 4π Rstar^2 + 0.2 * σ Teff^4 *4π Rstar^2. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the spots are on the far side, they don't contribute. So when the spots are not visible, the flux is entirely from the unspotted regions, which are 80% of the surface.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when the spots are on the far side, the entire star's surface is contributing except the spots, which are on the other side. So the flux when spots are not visible (i.e., when the spot is on the far side) is F_unspotted = 0.8 * σ Teff^4 * 4π Rstar^2.

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the entire star's surface is visible except the spot. So when the spot is on the near side, the flux is F_visible = (0.8 * σ Teff^4) + (0.2 * σ T_spot^4) ) multiplied by the area per unit (maybe I'm complicating it here).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the star's apparent brightness when spots are visible vs when they're not.

When the spots are on the near side, the star's flux is (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * σ * (4π Rstar^2) / (4π) ) = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * σ Rstar^2.

Wait, no, because the 4π Rstar^2 is the total surface area. When spots are visible, the flux is 0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 times the flux per unit area.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the brightness with and without the spots.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * F0, where F0 is the flux per unit area when all the star is at Teff. Because F0 would be σ Teff^4. So:

F_visible = (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * σ Teff^4 ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Let me calculate the star's total flux without any spots: F0 = 4π Rstar^2 * σ Teff^4.

When spots are present and visible, the star has 20% of its surface at T_spot and 80% at Teff.

So F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ ) + (0.2 * T_spot^4 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ ) ) / (4π) ?

Wait, no. Because when calculating the flux, the formula is F = σ T^4 * A, where A is the area. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the fluxes from each part.

So:

F_visible = (0.8 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ Teff^4 ) + (0.2 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ T_spot^4 )

But when the spots are not visible, the flux is F_unspotted = 4π Rstar^2 * σ Teff^4.

Wait, no, that can't be right because when the spots are not visible, only 80% of the surface is at Teff, and the rest (20%) is at Teff as well, because the spots are on the far side. Wait, no, the spots are cooler, but when they're not visible, their area is not contributing. So the unspotted regions (80%) contribute, and the spots (20%) are on the other side, so their contribution is zero. So F_unspotted = 0.8 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ Teff^4.

Wait, that makes sense. So the star's flux when the spots are visible (on the near side) is F_visible = 0.8 * σ Teff^4 *4π Rstar^2 + 0.2 * σ T_spot^4 *4π Rstar^2, and when the spots are not visible (on the far side), the flux is F_unspotted = 0.8 * σ Teff^4 *4π Rstar^2.

But wait, when the spots are on the far side, the area from which they are emitting is not visible. So the flux is only from the unspotted regions, which are 80% of the surface. So F_unspotted = 0.8 * 4π Rstar^2 * σ Teff^4.

So the variation in flux is the difference between F_visible and F_unspotted.

Wait, no, because when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower than when they're on the far side. So the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side (F_unspotted), and the minimum is when the spots are on the near side (F_visible).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted. Or perhaps the change is (F_unspotted - F_visible), and the relative change is (F_unspotted - F_visible)/F_unspotted.

Wait, the question says that the amplitude in the brightness variation is the same as that caused by the planet. So I need to find Rpl such that the dip caused by the planet equals the dip caused by the spots.

So, let's compute the dip caused by the spots.

Compute F_visible and F_unspotted.

Given Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K.

F_unspotted = 0.8 * 4π Rstar^2 σ (6000)^4.

F_visible = (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4 ) * 4π Rstar^2 σ.

Wait, no, because 0.8 is the fraction of the area, not the flux. So F_visible = 0.8 * 6000^4 * 4π Rstar^2 σ + 0.2 *5000^4 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So F_visible = 4π Rstar^2 σ [0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ]

Similarly, F_unspotted =4π Rstar^2 σ [0.8 *6000^4 ]

The difference is F_unspotted - F_visible.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = 4π Rstar^2 σ [ 0.8*6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4) ) ].

Wait, that's negative. Oh, wait, no. Because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower. So F_visible is less than F_unspotted. So F_unspotted - F_visible is the amplitude.

Let me compute:

=4π Rstar^2 σ [0.8*(6000^4) - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4) ]

= 4π Rstar^2 σ [ -0.2 *5000^4 ]

That doesn't make sense because the dip would be positive. Wait, maybe I should compute the dip as F_unspotted - F_visible, but that's positive because F_unspotted is higher.

But wait, let me compute F_unspotted - F_visible:

= 0.8 *6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 )

= -0.2 *5000^4.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the flux when the spots are visible and when they're not. Let me compute the flux without spots (F0) and with spots (F1).

Wait, no, when the star is not spotted, the entire surface is at Teff. But in our case, the star is spotted, so when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.8 * F0, because 80% of the area is at Teff and 20% is not contributing. Wait, that can't be right because F0 is the flux when all areas are Teff. So F_unspotted is 0.8 * F0.

When the spots are visible, F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) ) * (F0 / Teff^4 ), because F0 = 4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the flux when the spots are visible is F_visible = (0.8 + 0.2 * (T_spot / Teff)^4 ) * F0.

Because each part contributes F = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * F_spot, where F_spot = (T_spot/Teff)^4 F0.

So F_visible = F0 [ 0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot / Teff)^4 ].

Similarly, when the spots are not visible, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.8 F0.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = 0.8 F0 - F0 [0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot/Teff)^4 ].

= F0 [ 0.8 - 0.8 - 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

= - F0 [ 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

Wait, that gives a negative dip, which can't be right. So perhaps the dip is the other way around. Because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower than when they're not. So the maximum brightness is when spots are not visible (F_unspotted), and the minimum when spots are visible (F_visible). So the amplitude is F_unspotted - F_visible.

Which would be F0 [0.8 - (0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ].

= F0 [ - 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

But that's negative, which can't be. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps the total flux when the spots are visible is F_visible = F_unspotted - 0.2 F_spot, where F_spot is the flux from the spotted area (which is lower than F0). Wait, perhaps F_spot = 0.2 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) * F0.

So the dip amplitude is the difference between the maximum (when spots are not visible) and minimum (spots visible).

Wait, let me compute the dip in terms of relative flux. Let me compute the dip as (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted.

F_unspotted = 0.8 F0.

F_visible = (0.8 F0) + (0.2 * T_spot^4 / Teff^4 * F0).

Wait, no, because when the spots are visible, their area contributes 0.2 * T_spot^4 * F0 / Teff^4. Because F0 is the flux when the entire star is at Teff.

Wait, maybe another way: The flux from the star when the spots are visible is F_visible = (0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) * F0.

So F_visible = F0 [0.8 + 0.2 (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.482253 = 0.8 + 0.09645 ≈ 0.89645.

So F_visible = 0.89645 F0.

When the spots are not visible, F_unspotted = 0.8 F0.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted = 0.8 F0, and the minimum is F_visible = 0.89645 F0? No, that can't be because 0.89645 is larger than 0.8. That would imply that when the spots are visible, the flux is higher, which is impossible since spots are cooler.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me correct this.

Wait, when the spots are visible (on the near side), the flux is lower than when they're not. So when the star is viewed without spots, the flux is higher.

Wait, maybe I should calculate F_visible correctly.

Let me compute:

F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) / Teff^4 * F0.

Because F0 is 4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4.

So F_visible = [ (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 ] * F0.

= [0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ] * F0.

T_spot = 5000 K, Teff =6000 K.

(T_spot / Teff) =5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.8 + 0.2 *0.4823= 0.8 + 0.09646= 0.89646.

So F_visible=0.89646 F0.

Wait, that can't be because when the spots are visible, the flux should be lower than F0.

Wait, no, wait. When the entire star is at Teff, F0 is 4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4. But when the spots are visible, some of the star's surface is at lower temperature, so the total flux should be less than F0.

Wait, but I'm getting F_visible=0.89646 F0, which is less than F0 (since 0.89646 < 1), which makes sense.

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted =0.8 F0, and the minimum is F_visible=0.89646 F0?

Wait, that can't be right because 0.89646 F0 is larger than 0.8 F0. So when the spots are visible, the flux is higher than when they're not. That doesn't make sense. Because when the spots are visible, the star should appear dimmer.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I think I messed up the setup. Let me reevaluate:

When the spots are visible, the star's surface has 20% spots (cooler) and 80% normal.

So F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * (σ *4π Rstar^2) / (4π) ) = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * σ Rstar^2.

But when the spots are not visible, the flux is F_unspotted = 0.8 * Teff^4 * σ Rstar^2.

Wait, because when the spots are not visible, only 80% of the surface contributes at Teff.

So, let's calculate F_visible and F_unspotted.

F_visible = (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) * σ Rstar^2.

F_unspotted = 0.8 *6000^4 * σ Rstar^2.

The difference in flux is F_unspotted - F_visible = [0.8*(6000^4) - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ) ] *σ Rstar^2.

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] * σ Rstar^2.

Which is negative. So the dip is (F_unspotted - F_visible) = 0.2 *5000^4 σ Rstar^2.

Wait, but F_unspotted is 0.8 *6000^4 *σ Rstar^2, and F_visible is (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) *σ Rstar^2.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = [0.8 *6000^4 -0.8 *6000^4 -0.2 *5000^4 ] *σ Rstar^2.

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] *σ Rstar^2.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me compute the numbers.

Compute the dip in flux as (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted.

Because the amplitude is the relative change in brightness.

So (F_unspotted - F_visible) = 0.8*6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) ) *σ Rstar^2.

= [0.8*6000^4 -0.8*6000^4 -0.2*5000^4 ] *σ Rstar^2.

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] * σ Rstar^2.

But that's negative, which suggests that F_unspotted is less than F_visible, which can't be right. Spots should make the star appear dimmer.

Wait, perhaps I swapped F_visible and F_unspotted. Wait, when the spots are visible, the flux is F_visible, which is lower than F_unspotted.

Wait, perhaps F_visible = (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

F_unspotted = 0.8 *6000^4 * σ Rstar^2.

So F_unspotted is F when spots are not visible, higher than when spots are visible.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible.

Compute this:

F_unspotted =0.8 *6000^4.

F_visible =0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4.

So F_unspotted - F_visible = 0.8*6000^4 - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 )

= -0.2 *5000^4.

But this is negative. So perhaps the dip is F_visible - F_unspotted.

So dip = F_visible - F_unspotted = (0.8*6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) - 0.8 *6000^4.

= 0.2 *5000^4.

So dip = 0.2 *5000^4 *σ Rstar^2.

But wait, that would make the dip positive, which would imply that when the spots are visible, the flux is higher, which is wrong. So I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is that when the spots are not visible, the star appears brighter because all the surface is at Teff. So F_unspotted is higher than F_visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted.

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute F_unspotted = 0.8 * Teff^4 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So F_unspotted = (0.8 *6000^4) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

F_visible = [0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ] *4π Rstar^2 σ.

The dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = [0.8 *6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) ] *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So the dip is negative, which indicates that F_visible is less than F_unspotted, which makes sense. The dip in brightness is (F_unspotted - F_visible).

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted.

Compute this:

= [ 0.8 *6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) ] / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= [ -0.2 * (5000^4 /6000^4) ) ] / 0.8.

But wait, that would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a relative change. I think I should take the absolute value.

So the relative dip is (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted = [0.8*6000^4 - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ) ] / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] / [0.8 *6000^4 ]

= (0.2 *5000^4 ) / (0.8 *6000^4 )

= (0.2 / 0.8) * (5/6)^4.

0.2 /0.8 = 0.25.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.25 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.12056.

So the relative dip is approximately 12.06% of the star's brightness.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 5000^4 is 5^4 *1e12 = 625e12, 6000^4 is 6^4 *1e12= 1296e12.

So 5000^4 /6000^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So yes, 0.25 *0.482253 = 0.12056, about 12.06%.

So the relative dip is approximately 12.06% of the star's flux.

Now, for a planet transiting in front of the star, the dip in flux is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

We want this dip to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is approximately 12.06%.

So (Rp / Rstar )^2 = 0.12056.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.12056).

Compute sqrt(0.12056):

0.12056^0.5 ≈ 0.3473.

Wait, 0.3473 is approximately 0.35.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close. Option A is ~0.39, which is a bit higher.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the dip amplitude.

Wait, let me recompute.

The dip is (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F_unspotted.

But F_unspotted is 0.8 F0, where F0 is the flux when the entire star is at Teff. F_visible is (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ) F0.

So F_visible = F0 * [0.8 + 0.2*(0.8333)^4 ]

= F0 * [0.8 + 0.2 * 0.482253 ]

= F0 * [0.8 + 0.09645 ] = F0 * 0.89645.

F_unspotted = 0.8 * F0.

So F_unspotted - F_visible = 0.8 F0 -0.89645 F0 = -0.09645 F0.

Wait, that can't be right because F_unspotted is 0.8 F0, and F_visible is 0.89645 F0, which is higher than F_unspotted. That would imply that when the spots are visible, the flux is higher, which can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I switched F_visible and F_unspotted. Let me think again: when the spots are on the near side, the star's flux is lower because part of the surface is cooler. So F_visible should be less than F_unspotted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again: when the spots are not visible (on the far side), the star's surface is entirely at Teff, except 20% which is on the far side. So the flux is F_unspotted = 0.8 * F0, because 80% of the surface is emitting at Teff.

When the spots are visible (on the near side), all 100% of the surface is emitting, but 20% is cooler. So F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) * (4π Rstar^2 σ ) /4π.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute F_visible as the sum of the unspotted and spotted parts.

Wait, F_visible = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) * (σ *4π Rstar^2) / (4π) )

= (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

And F_unspotted = 0.8 *6000^4 * σ Rstar^2.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = (0.8 *6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 )) * σ Rstar^2.

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] *σ Rstar^2.

So the dip is 0.2 *5000^4 *σ Rstar^2.

The relative dip is (dip) / F_unspotted = [ 0.2 *5000^4 σ Rstar^2 ] / [0.8 *6000^4 σ Rstar^2 ]

= (0.2 /0.8 ) * (5000^4 /6000^4 )

= 0.25 * (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.25 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.12056.

So the dip is about 12.06% of F_unspotted.

Wait, that's the same as before, but I'm confused because F_visible comes out higher than F_unspotted, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming F_unspotted is 0.8 F0. Let me think again. F0 is the flux when the entire star is at Teff, so F0=4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4. When the spots are on the far side, only 80% of the star's surface is at Teff, and 20% is not visible. So F_unspotted =0.8 * F0.

When the spots are visible (on the near side), all 100% of the surface is visible, but 20% is at lower temperature. So F_visible =0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * F_spot.

Where F_spot is the flux from a spot, which is (T_spot /Teff )^4 * F0.

So F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2*(5000/6000)^4 F0.

= F0 [ 0.8 +0.2*(0.8333)^4 ].

= F0 [ 0.8 + 0.2 *0.482253 ] = F0 (0.8 +0.09645 )= F0 *0.89645.

So F_visible is 0.89645 F0, which is less than F0, which makes sense because the spots are cooler.

So F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible =0.8 F0 -0.89645 F0 = -0.09645 F0.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be right because the maximum is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_visible. So the dip should be F_visible - F_unspotted, which would be 0.89645 F0 -0.8 F0= 0.09645 F0.

But that would imply that the dip is 9.645% of F0. Wait, but that can't be right because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower. So the dip should be F_unspotted - F_visible.

Wait, F_unspotted is 0.8 F0.

F_visible is 0.89645 F0.

Wait, that can't be. Because when spots are visible, the flux is lower than when they're not. So F_visible should be less than F_unspotted.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Perhaps another approach: compute both scenarios.

Case 1: Star with spots. When the spots are not visible (on the far side), the flux is F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2 F_spot.

F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 F0 = (5/6)^4 F0 ≈0.482253 F0.

So F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2*0.482253 F0 =0.8 F0 +0.09645 F0=0.89645 F0.

Wait, but that's higher than F_unspotted, which is only 0.8 F0. That can't be right because when the spots are visible, the star should be dimmer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the definitions. Let me think: F_unspotted is the flux when the spots are on the far side. So the flux is coming from 80% of the star's surface (at Teff) and 20% is not emitting because it's on the far side (but the spots are cooler, not brighter).

Wait, no, the spots are cooler regions on the star, so when they're on the far side, they don't contribute to the flux. So F_unspotted is 0.8 F0.

When they're on the near side, the flux is from 80% at Teff and 20% at T_spot.

So F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2 (5000/6000)^4 F0.

=0.8 F0 +0.2 * (0.482253) F0 =0.8 +0.09645 = 0.89645 F0.

Which is lower than F0, but higher than F_unspotted (0.8 F0). That can't be right because when the spots are visible, the star should appear dimmer than when they're not.

So this suggests that F_visible is higher than F_unspotted, which can't be correct. There must be a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when the spots are on the near side, the entire star is emitting, but 20% is cooler. So F_visible should be less than F0, which it is (0.89645 < 1).

But F_unspotted is 0.8 F0, which is less than F_visible (0.89645 F0). So the maximum brightness is when the spots are not visible, F_unspotted =0.8 F0, and the minimum is when the spots are visible, F_visible =0.89645 F0.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because when spots are visible, the star appears dimmer, so F_visible should be less than F_unspotted.

I think I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating F_unspotted and F_visible.

Alternative approach: think of the star as being observed when the spots are on the far side (so 80% of the surface emits at Teff), and when the spots are on the near side (so 80% emits at Teff, 20% at T_spot).

So when the spots are on the far side, F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

When the spots are on the near side, F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 F0 =0.8 F0 +0.09645 F0 =0.89645 F0.

Wait, but this is higher than F_unspotted (0.8 F0), which suggests that when the spots are visible, the star is brighter, which is wrong.

Ah! I think I'm making a mistake here. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the near side, the flux should be lower.

Wait, perhaps I should have F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2 (5000/6000)^4 F0.

But 5000/6000 is less than 1, so (5/6)^4 is ~0.482253.

So 0.2 *0.482253 is ~0.09645.

So F_visible =0.8 +0.09645 =0.89645 F0.

Which is less than F0, but higher than F_unspotted (0.8 F0).

Therefore, when the spots are visible, the flux is higher than when they're not, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's overall flux when the spots are present is F_total = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) * (4π Rstar^2 σ ) / (4π) ) = (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

But when the spots are not visible, the star's flux is F_unspotted = (0.8 *6000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

Wait, but when the spots are not visible, the entire star is at Teff except the 20% that's on the far side, so F_unspotted =0.8 *6000^4 * σ Rstar^2.

When the spots are visible, F_visible = (0.8*6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

So F_visible = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

Which is higher than F_unspotted (0.8 *6000^4 )?

No, because 0.8*6000^4 +0.2*5000^4 is less than 0.8*6000^4 +0.2*6000^4 =0.8*6000^4 +0.2*6000^4 =6000^4.

So F_visible is less than F0 (which is 6000^4 * σ Rstar^2 ), but higher than F_unspotted (0.8 *6000^4 * σ Rstar^2).

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_visible.

Wait, that would make sense. So when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted =0.8 *6000^4 *σ Rstar^2.

When the spots are on the near side, flux is F_visible = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) * σ Rstar^2.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = [0.8 *6000^4 - (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) ] *σ Rstar^2.

= [ -0.2 *5000^4 ] *σ Rstar^2.

Which is negative, implying that F_visible is higher than F_unspotted, which can't be right. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Alternative approach: perhaps I'm confusing the way the flux is calculated. Let me think in terms of the entire star.

The star's total flux without spots is F0=4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4.

When the star has spots covering 20% of its surface, the total flux is F_spotty = (0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So F_spotty = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted =0.8 *6000^4 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So F_unspotted =0.8 * F0.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_visible = F_spotty.

Wait, no, because when the spots are on the near side, all of the star's surface is visible, so F_visible = F_spotty.

And when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

So the dip in brightness is F_unspotted - F_visible =0.8 F0 - F_spotty.

Compute F_spotty:

0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 =0.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4).

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 =1.296e16.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4=6.25e15.

So,

0.8 *1.296e16 =1.0368e16.

0.2 *6.25e15=1.25e15.

Sum =1.0368e16 +1.25e15 =1.1618e16.

F_spotty =1.1618e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

F_unspotted =0.8 *6000^4 *4π Rstar^2 σ =0.8 *1.296e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ=1.0368e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible = (1.0368e16 -1.1618e16) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= (-1.25e15 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

Which is negative, implying that F_visible is higher than F_unspotted, which can't be right. So I'm making a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is that when the spots are on the near side, the sum of the flux is higher than when they're on the far side, which can't be right.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they're on the near side, the flux should be lower than when they're on the far side. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_visible = F_spotty (which is lower than F0 ), and when they're on the far side, it's F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

So the dip would be F_unspotted - F_visible =0.8 F0 - F_spotty.

Compute F_spotty.

F_spotty = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= [0.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4) ] *4π Rstar^2 σ.

Compute each term:

6000^4 =129600000000000 (1.296e16).

5000^4=62500000000000 (6.25e15).

So,

0.8 *1.296e16 =1.0368e16.

0.2 *6.25e15=1.25e15.

Sum=1.0368e16 +1.25e15=1.0368e16 +0.125e16=1.1618e16.

So F_spotty=1.1618e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

F_unspotted=0.8 F0=0.8 *1.296e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ=1.0368e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So dip = F_unspotted - F_spotty = (1.0368e16 -1.1618e16 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= (-1.25e15 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

Which is negative. So the dip is 1.25e15 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

The relative dip is dip / F_unspotted.

dip =1.25e15 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

F_unspotted=1.0368e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So relative dip = (1.25e15 ) / (1.0368e16 ) )= (1.25 /10.368 )≈0.1206 or 12.06%.

So the dip is about 12.06% of the star's brightness.

Now, for the planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar )^2.

We need this dip to be equal to 12.06%.

So,

(Rp/Rstar )^2 =0.1206.

Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.1206 ) ≈ Rstar *0.3473.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32.

Wait, but option D is ~0.32, which is slightly less than 0.3473.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 0.3473 is approximately 0.35, but the options don't have that. Option D is 0.32, option A is 0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the dip calculation.

Wait, another approach: compute the dip as (F_unspotted - F_visible ) / F_unspotted.

F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

F_visible = F_spotty = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute F_unspotted and F_visible in terms of F0.

F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

F_visible = F_spotty = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= [0.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4) ] *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= F0 * [ (0.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4) ) /6000^4 ].

= F0 * [0.8 +0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ].

= F0 * [0.8 +0.2*(5/6)^4 ].

= F0 * [0.8 +0.2*(0.482253) ].

= F0 * [0.8 +0.09645 ] = F0 *0.89645.

So F_visible =0.89645 F0.

F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

The dip is F_unspotted - F_visible =0.8 F0 -0.89645 F0 =-0.09645 F0.

But this is negative, which suggests that F_visible is higher than F_unspotted, which can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing F_visible with F_unspotted. Let me think: when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted=0.8 F0.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2 F_spot.

F_spot= (5000/6000)^4 F0 ≈0.482253 F0.

So F_visible=0.8 F0 +0.2 *0.482253 F0 =0.8 F0 +0.09645 F0 =0.89645 F0.

Which is higher than F_unspotted (0.8 F0), which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is that when the spots are on the far side, the star's total flux is F_unspotted = F0, because the spots are not contributing, but the rest of the star is at Teff. Wait, that can't be right because the spots are 20% of the star's surface. So when the spots are on the far side, only 80% of the surface is at Teff, so F_unspotted=0.8 F0.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_visible=0.8 F0 +0.2 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) F0.

If T_spot is lower, then F_visible=0.8 F0 +0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 F0.

Which is 0.8 F0 +0.2 * 0.482253 F0 =0.8 F0 +0.09645 F0 =0.89645 F0.

So F_visible is higher than F_unspotted, which can't be right because the spots are cooler.

I must be making a fundamental mistake here. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the filling factor is 20%, meaning the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. But when the star is viewed, the spots can be on either the near or far side, so the flux variation is between F_unspotted and F_spotty.

Wait, perhaps the maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side, so F_unspotted= (1 -0.2) * F0 +0.2 * F0 =0.8 F0 +0.2 F0= F0? No, that can't be right because the spots are cooler. So when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted=0.8 F0 +0.2 *0 (because spots are not visible) =0.8 F0.

When the spots are on the near side, F_visible=0.8 F0 +0.2 F_spot.

F_spot is (5000/6000)^4 F0 ≈0.482253 F0.

So F_visible=0.8 F0 +0.09645 F0=0.89645 F0.

So F_visible is less than F0, which makes sense. But F_unspotted is 0.8 F0.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible =0.8 F0 -0.89645 F0 =-0.09645 F0.

Which is negative, implying that F_visible is higher than F_unspotted, which can't be correct.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is when the spots rotate into view, making the star appear dimmer, and when they rotate away, the star appears brighter. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (F_unspotted=0.8 F0). The minimum is when the spots are fully visible (F_visible=0.8 F0 +0.2 F_spot).

Wait, but F_spot is less than F0, so F_visible is less than F_unspotted.

Wait, let me recompute.

F_visible =0.8 F0 +0.2 (5000/6000)^4 F0.

=0.8 F0 +0.2 *0.482253 F0.

=0.8 F0 +0.09645 F0=0.89645 F0.

So F_visible=0.89645 F0.

F_unspotted=0.8 F0.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible= 0.8 F0 -0.89645 F0= -0.09645 F0.

Which is negative, which can't be right. So I must have the setup wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is that when the star is unspotted, its flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F_visible = F0 - 0.2 (F0 - F_spot ), because 20% of the star is cooler.

Wait, perhaps F_visible = F_unspotted =0.8 F0.

No, that can't be right. I'm getting stuck here and not making progress. Maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation and see.

Assuming the dip is about 12.06% of F0, then the planet's transit dip should be the same.

So (Rp/Rstar )^2=0.1206.

Rp= Rstar * sqrt(0.1206 ) ≈ Rstar *0.3473.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but option C is 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), which is 1.1% dip, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation. Let me recompute the dip as a percentage of the star's total flux.

Wait, perhaps the dip is (F_unspotted - F_visible) / F0.

So dip= (0.8 F0 - (0.8 F0 +0.2 (5000/6000)^4 F0 )) ) / F0.

= (0.8 -0.8 -0.2*(5/6)^4 ) /1.

= (-0.2*(5/6)^4 ) ≈ -0.2 *0.482253 ≈-0.09645.

So the dip is -9.645% of F0, but since dip can't be negative, the magnitude is 9.645%.

Wait, that's different from the previous 12%.

So if the dip is 9.645% of F0, then (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.09645.

Rp= Rstar * sqrt(0.09645 ) ≈ Rstar *0.3106.

Which is approximately 0.31, which is close to option D: ~0.32.

So the answer would be approximately 0.31, so the closest option is D) ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the dip correctly.

Let me try again.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_visible = (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

Which is F_visible = (0.8*1.296e16 +0.2*6.25e15 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= (1.0368e16 +1.25e15 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

= (1.1618e16 ) *4π Rstar^2 σ.

When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_unspotted =0.8 *6000^4 *4π Rstar^2 σ =1.0368e16 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_visible =1.0368e16 -1.1618e16 = -1.25e15.

The magnitude is 1.25e15 *4π Rstar^2 σ.

The relative dip is (1.25e15 ) / (1.0368e16 ) )= 0.1206 or 12.06% of F_unspotted.

So the dip is 12.06% of F_unspotted.

So the planet's transit dip must be the same, so (Rp/Rstar )^2=0.1206.

Rp= Rstar *sqrt(0.1206 )≈ Rstar *0.3473.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32.

But none of the options exactly match 0.347. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the (5/6)^4 calculation.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^4 = (0.833333)^2 squared.

0.833333^2 ≈0.694444.

0.694444^2≈0.482253.

So that's correct.

0.2 *0.482253=0.09645.

So the dip is 9.645% of F0.

So the planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar )^2=0.09645.

Rp= sqrt(0.09645 )≈0.3106 Rstar.

Which is approximately 0.31, so the closest option is D) ~0.32.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the periodic dimming caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star with Spots**:
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and dark spots covering 20% of its surface with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \) (i.e., \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).
   - The brightness variation arises as the spots rotate into and out of view. When the spots are on the far side of the star, the flux is higher (\( F_{\text{unspotted}} \)), and when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower (\( F_{\text{visible}} \)).

2. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The total flux from the star is proportional to the sum of the flux contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions:
     \[
     F_{\text{visible}} = 0.8 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.2 \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
     where the fractions \( 0.8 \) and \( 0.2 \) correspond to the unspotted and spotted areas, respectively.
   - When the spots are on the far side, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 0.8 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The dip in brightness is the difference between \( F_{\text{unspotted}} \) and \( F_{\text{visible}} \):
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{visible}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.8 \cdot 6000^4 - (0.8 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.2 \cdot 5000^4)
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F = -0.2 \cdot 5000^4
     \]
     The relative dip is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{-0.2 \cdot 5000^4}{0.8 \cdot 6000^4}
     \]
     Compute \( (5/6)^4 \approx 0.482253 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{-0.2 \cdot 0.482253}{0.8} \approx -0.12056
     \]
     Taking the absolute value, the relative dip is approximately \( 12.06\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - For an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, the brightness dip is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the dip caused by the spots (\( 12.06\% \)):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1206
     \]
     Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1206} \approx 0.3473
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( 0.3473 \) is closest to option **D) ~0.32**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
