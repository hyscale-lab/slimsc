Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, the problem gives me two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics because at high speeds, the effects of relativity become significant. So I'll probably need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for their relative speed and the relativistic energy formulas for their energies.

Wait, the question has two parts: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me break it down into two parts.

Starting with the relative speed. In classical mechanics, relative speed would just be the difference, like 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But relativity doesn't work that way. Oh right, because velocities don't simply subtract in relativity. Instead, you have to use the formula:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²))

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. The velocity addition formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, I think that's when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So in this case, the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so one is moving at v1 = 0.6c, the other at v2 = 0.5c. So the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's perspective would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))? Or wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, the formula is generally used when you have two velocities u and v, and you want to find the velocity of one as seen from the other frame. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as the second's frame. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So the astronaut with 2m is moving at 0.6c, and the one with 3m at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the 2m astronaut, how fast is the 3m astronaut moving relative to him?

So you take B's velocity u = 0.5c, and the relative frame is moving at 0.6c, so u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) 

Let me calculate that numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since it's negative, it's moving in the opposite direction from A's perspective. But the question asks for the relative speed, which is a magnitude. So 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's one of the options. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Wait, but wait a second. Which astronaut's frame are we calculating the relative speed from? The problem says "relative speed", but relative to whom? Oh, I think in this context, the relative speed would be the speed at which one astronaut moves with respect to the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²), which is -0.1c / 0.7 = -0.1428c, so 0.1428c in the opposite direction. But speed is magnitude, so 0.14c. So that's about 0.14c. 

Alternatively, from B's frame, A's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1428c. So either way, the speed is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which matches option C and D.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² = 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and option D says E=5 mc^2. So our calculation here gives approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option should have relative speed 0.14c and E≈5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So option C is the one that matches both conditions.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the energies. Did I make any mistake?

Gamma1: 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c²= 2.5 m c². That's correct.

Gamma2: 0.5c, so v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=~0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. E2=1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 m c². Adding to E1: 2.5 +3.464=5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So yes, option C is correct.

Now, checking the options again. The options for relative speed:

Option A: 1.1c (can't be, since it's greater than c, which is impossible).

Option B: 0.1c (but we found it to be ~0.14c).

Option C: 0.14c.

Option D: 0.14c.

So both C and D have the correct relative speed. But only C has the correct energy. So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses \(2m\) and \(3m\), traveling at relativistic speeds \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\), respectively, in the positive x-direction.

### Part 1: Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Part 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(2m, 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(3m, 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\) (incorrect, as \(v_{\text{rel}} > c\) is impossible).
- **Option B**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\) (incorrect, as \(v_{\text{rel}}\) is not \(0.1c\)).
- **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\) (correct).
- **Option D**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\) (incorrect, as \(E \neq 5m c^2\)).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
