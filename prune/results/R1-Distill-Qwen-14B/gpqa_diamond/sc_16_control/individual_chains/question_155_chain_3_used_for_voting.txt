Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again. So, we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form in a basis that's the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of Pz in this state.

Hmm, so I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I need to find ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for the given state.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is an eigenstate of Px, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Pz. So Pz doesn't have a definite value, hence the uncertainty.

First, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I need to apply the Pz matrix to the state vector and then take the inner product. Similarly, for ⟨Pz²⟩, I apply Pz squared (so Pz squared is Pz multiplied by Pz) and then take the inner product.

Let me write down the given state vector. It's a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but I should double-check if this is normalized. Let me calculate the norm: ( (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So it's normalized. Good.

Next, the matrix Pz is given as:

Pz = [[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
       [ 0, 0, 0 ],
       [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So, to calculate ⟨Pz⟩, we compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Let me write ψ as a row vector for the bra part. So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Then, ψ† Pz is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*0 ] for the first component, wait no. Wait, matrix multiplication: each element is the dot product of the row of ψ† with each column of Pz.

Wait, more accurately, Pz is a 3x3 matrix. ψ is a column vector 3x1. So ψ† is 1x3. So ψ† Pz will be 1x3 multiplied by 3x3, giving 1x3? Wait, no. Wait, ψ† is 1x3, Pz is 3x3, so ψ† Pz is 1x3. Then, when we multiply by ψ (3x1), we get a scalar.

So, let's compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Breaking it down:

Each element of ψ† Pz is the product of ψ† with each column of Pz.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each component step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps just compute each component step by step.

So, Pz ψ would be:

First element: (ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0.

Third element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2.

So, Pz ψ is a column vector [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ⟨Pz⟩ is ψ† (Pz ψ) = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Calculating the dot product:

(-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Each term: (1/2)(ħ/2) from first term, 0 from second, and (-1/2)(ħ/2) from third.

So  (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0.

So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. Interesting. That makes sense because the state is symmetric in Pz's eigenbasis?

Wait, but the state has components -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2. The first and third components are the same. Since Pz has eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ for the first, second, third basis vectors.

So, the expectation value is (-1/2)(ħ) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ) = (-ħ/2) + (ħ/2) = 0. Yep, that's correct.

Now, next step: compute ⟨Pz²⟩.

Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just each diagonal element squared. So Pz² is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, and ħ².

So Pz² is [[ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0,0,0], [0,0,ħ² ] ].

Then, ⟨Pz²⟩ is ψ† Pz² ψ.

Calculating each component:

ψ† Pz² is [ (-1/2) ħ², (1/√2)*0, (-1/2) ħ² ].

Then, multiply by ψ:

( (-1/2) ħ² (-1/2) ) + (0)(1/√2) + ( (-1/2 ħ²)(-1/2) ) 

Wait, perhaps better to compute Pz² ψ first.

Pz² ψ is:

First element: (ħ²)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ²/2.

Second element: 0*(all elements) → 0.

Third element: ( ħ² )( -1/2 ) → -ħ² / 2? Wait, no. Wait, Pz² is diagonal, so each element in Pz² ψ is the original ψ multiplied by the diagonal element.

Wait, no. Pz² is diagonal, so when you multiply Pz² with ψ, it's same as scaling each component by the diagonal elements.

So, ψ is [a, b, c]^T. So Pz² ψ is [ a * ħ², b * 0, c * ħ² ]^T.

So a is -1/2, c is -1/2.

So Pz² ψ is [ (-1/2) ħ² , 0, (-1/2) ħ² ]^T.

Then, ψ† (Pz² ψ) is the dot product of ψ with this vector.

So, each component:

(-1/2) * (-1/2 ħ² ) → (1/4) ħ².

(1/√2) * 0 → 0.

(-1/2) * (-1/2 ħ² ) → (1/4) ħ².

Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Then, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt( ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² ).

Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation of ⟨Pz²⟩.

So, when I compute Pz² ψ, each component is as follows:

First component: (1st basis vector) is multiplied by ħ². So ( -1/2 ) * ħ² → -ħ²/2.

Second component: (2nd basis vector) is multiplied by 0. So 0.

Third component: (3rd basis vector) is multiplied by ħ². The third component of ψ is -1/2, so ( -1/2 ) * ħ² → -ħ²/2.

Wait, no. Wait, Pz squared is [[ ħ², 0, 0 ], [0,0,0], [0,0, ħ² ]], so the third component is multiplied by ħ², which is positive. So ψ's third component is -1/2, so (-1/2)*ħ² = -ħ²/2.

Wait, but when you take the inner product, ψ† (Pz² ψ) would be:

(-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2 )

So each term: (1/2 * ħ² / 2) → (1/4) ħ².

The third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2 ) → (1/4) ħ².

So adding (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² gives (1/2) ħ². That's correct.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Thus, ΔPz = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options: option B is ħ/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait one more time. Let me make sure about the calculation of Pz squared's expectation. I think I might have made a mistake earlier.

An alternative approach: since Pz is diagonal, the expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2, where c_i are the components of ψ and λ_i are the eigenvalues.

In this case, the eigenstates of Pz are the basis vectors, so the components of ψ are the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

So, the first component is -1/2, which has |c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, and λ1 is ħ. So (1/4)(ħ²).

The second component is 1/√2, |c2|^2 = 1/2. The eigenvalue for Pz in this state is 0, so (1/2)(0)^2 = 0.

The third component is -1/2, |c3|^2 = 1/4, eigenvalue -ħ. So (1/4)( (-ħ)^2 ) = (1/4) ħ².

Adding them together: 1/4 ħ² + 0 + 1/4 ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So same result.

So the calculation is correct. Therefore, ΔPz is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we first calculate $P_z \psi$:

\[
P_z \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the inner product with $\psi^\dagger$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, we first calculate $P_z^2 \psi$:

\[
P_z^2 \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the inner product with $\psi^\dagger$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
