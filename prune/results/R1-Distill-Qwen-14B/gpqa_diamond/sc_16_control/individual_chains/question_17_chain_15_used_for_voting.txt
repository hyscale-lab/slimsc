Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. Hmm. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a specific concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. 

The given data: the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant, Kf, is really high, meaning it's a stable complex. So the problem is about the dissociation of this complex into calcium and EDTA ions.

I think the formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but sometimes people use the dissociation constant, which would be the inverse. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and Kf would be [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

But wait, the problem gives K as KCa-EDTA =5e10, which I think is the formation constant. So assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, but if the complex dissociates, then [Ca²+] and [EDTA] would be equal because the reaction is 1:1. So if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates a little bit, let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then the concentration of EDTA would also be x, because each mole of complex releases one mole of each. But wait, that's assuming that the EDTA comes from the complex, right? Because in solution, EDTA could be from the complex or from other sources, but in this case, we're told it's a stoichiometric solution—so probably all EDTA in solution comes from the complex.

But wait, wait. The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, when it's undissociated, the concentrations are [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA] =0. But as it dissociates, let's say s is the amount that dissociates. So [Ca²+] would be s, [EDTA] would be s, and [CaEDTA] would be 0.02 - s. But because K is very large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So s should be very small compared to 0.02. Therefore, 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02.

So the K expression would be:

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) = 5e10 = (0.02)/(s * s) = 0.02 / s²

So rearranging, s² = 0.02 / (5e10) → s² = 2e-3 /5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So s² = 4e-13 → s = sqrt(4e-13) → which is 2e-6.5? Wait wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute that. 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7 because 10^-7 is 1e-7, but 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7.

Wait, so sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So s is approximately 6.32e-7 M. 

So the concentration of calcium ions would be about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. The K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So s is small, assumption holds. 

So the setup was K = [CaEDTA]/[Ca²+][EDTA] → 5e10 = 0.02/(s^2). Solving for s gives s^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13 → s= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7. So the [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( s \). Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)), the concentration of the undissociated complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Thus, \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = s \) and \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = s \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{s^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( s^2 \):

\[
s^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
