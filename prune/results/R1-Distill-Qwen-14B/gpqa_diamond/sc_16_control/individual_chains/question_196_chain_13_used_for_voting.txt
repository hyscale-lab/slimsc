Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options provided are four mathematical expressions, so I need to figure out which one correctly represents the maximum speed under relativistic conditions.

Wait, the oscillator is obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, which is the classical case. But since it's relativistic, we have to consider effects like the increase in mass due to special relativity. Oh right, in relativity, the mass increases with velocity; the relativistic mass m' is given by m' = gamma * m, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m).

But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy expression is different. Oh right, the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy, and the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy. So the total energy E = gamma * m * c².

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which are equal at maximum velocity in SHM. So maximum velocity occurs when the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic plus potential equals the energy.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that in the relativistic case, the equation of motion might involve a modified form. But I'm not exactly sure about that. Wait, perhaps I should think about energy conservation.

The total energy in the oscillator is (1/2)kA², but wait, no—that's the classical case. Wait, no, in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, does the potential energy change? Or is the total energy different?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Hmm.

So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved. So at the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. At the maximum displacement, all energy is potential.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the total energy would be E = K + U. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is the relativistic expression.

So the total energy at maximum displacement is E = (1/2)kA² + K, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is conserved, but the expressions for kinetic and potential energy change.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), but in the relativistic case, the mass increases as gamma increases, which would make the speed lower than that.

Wait, wait. No. Because in the relativistic case, the KE is higher than the classical expression. So the maximum speed can't exceed c, obviously. So maybe I can derive the expression by considering energy.

At maximum displacement, x = A, potential energy U = (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest momentarily. So the total energy E = U = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait, no. Because in reality, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. Then, as it moves, the potential decreases and kinetic increases. So the total energy is (1/2)kA².

But in the relativistic scenario, the kinetic energy is not just (gamma - 1)mc², right? So wait, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or perhaps the total mechanical energy is more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which remains constant. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, and when x=A, all is potential.

But wait, the potential energy in relativity—does it change? I think in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)kx². So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the total energy E.

So when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is E, which in terms of relativistic expressions is E = gamma * m c².

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But in the relativistic case, E = gamma m c². So when the velocity is maximum, the kinetic energy is E - mc² = gamma m c² - mc².

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify.

In the non-relativistic case, E = K + U, where U = (1/2)kA². At x=0, K = (1/2)mv², and U=0. So E = (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA² → v² = (kA²)/m → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m).

In the relativistic case: the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. The total energy is gamma m c², which includes the rest energy. So when x is maximum, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, and the total energy is E = (1/2) k A². Wait, but wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², but in the relativistic case, maybe E is (1/2)kA² plus other terms. Or perhaps the form of E is different.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the relativistic formulation of the harmonic oscillator. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should use the relativistic equation of motion.

The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be written as d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, but solving that differential equation might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use energy conservation.

The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy, kinetic energy, and the potential energy. Wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², so when you have motion, the potential and kinetic energies are both present.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic case, E is still (1/2)kA², but now the kinetic energy is part of the total energy.

At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero (x=0), so all energy is kinetic. So E = K = (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)mv_max² = (gamma -1) mc². Because when v is small, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), so (gamma -1) mc² ≈ ( (v²)/(2c²) ) mc² = (1/2) m v² c² / c² = (1/2) m v², which matches.

So in the relativistic case, E = (gamma -1) mc².

But in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)k A². So (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can solve for v.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me square both sides to make it easier.

gamma squared is [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²).

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Then v²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

To find v, take the square root.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express v in terms of gamma.

Wait, but let's write it down:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2

Let me compute 1 - 1/(something squared) as [ (something squared -1) / something squared ].

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, factor the right-hand side.

Wait, let me compute the denominator:

Let me denote x = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 -1 ] / (1 + x)^2

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) = 2x + x² = x(2 + x)

So,

v²/c² = [x (2 + x)] / (1 + x)^2

Substituting back x = k A²/(2 m c²):

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) ) ]^2

Hmm, let's see. Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [2 + k A²/(2 m c²)] = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps simplifying this would be better.

Wait, let's compute 2 + x where x is k A²/(2 m c²)

So 2 + x = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²)

So the numerator is x * (2 + x) = [k A²/(2 m c²)] * [ (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (2 m c²) ) ] 

Which equals [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) ] / [ (2 m c²)(2 m c²) ) ] 

Denominator: (1 + x)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = ( (2 m c² + k A² ) )^2 / (2 m c²)^2 )

So putting it together:

v²/c² = [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

Which is:

[ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / ( (2 m c² )^2 ) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )/( (2 m c² )^2 ) ) ]

The denominators ( (2 m c² )^2 ) cancel out.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can factor some terms.

Let me write the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A²) 

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2 

Wait, let me see if I can write 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c²). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me factor 2 m c² as a term.

Let me denote B = 2 m c².

So denominator is (B + k A² / 2 )^2, because wait, no, wait: 2 m c² + k A² = (2 m c²) + k A². Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor k A² from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me take:

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: [k A² + 2 m c² ]^2 

So,

v²/c² = [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Hmm. Let me factor 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this can be expressed as:

[ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] = k A^2 ( [2 m c² ] * 2 + k A^2 )

But I'm not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe I should just proceed to take the square root.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express v_max in terms of gamma.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go back. The total energy E is (1/2) k A².

In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2) k A² = (1/2) m v_max^2 → v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/m )

But in the relativistic case, E = (gamma - 1) m c^2 + m c^2? Wait no, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c^2.

Wait, no: E is the total energy, which must equal the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + K, where K is the kinetic energy. So K = E - m c^2 = (gamma -1) m c².

But in the oscillator, E is the total energy, which is equal to (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma m c² = (1/2) k A².

Wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v². So that would imply gamma m c² = (1/2) m v², which would be impossible because gamma is greater than 1, and m c² is much larger than (1/2) m v² for non-relativistic speeds. So I must have messed up the energy expressions.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)k A², and at maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So E = (1/2) m v² = (1/2)k A² → v = sqrt( k A^2 / m )

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is still (1/2)k A^2. But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E = gamma m c².

But that would imply (1/2) k A² = gamma m c². But that would require gamma to be (1/2)k A²/(m c²), which might be less than 1 if (1/2)k A² is much less than m c². However, if (1/2)k A² is much larger, gamma could be greater than 1.

Wait, but if E is (1/2)k A², then in the relativistic case, E = gamma m c^2 → gamma = (1/2)k A²/(m c^2)

But wait, gamma must be >=1 because it's 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if (1/2)k A^2/(m c^2) >=1, then gamma would make sense. But if not, that would be a problem.

But wait, this seems conflicting. Let me think again. Maybe the total energy in the relativistic oscillator isn't (1/2)k A². Perhaps the potential energy is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the same as the classical case, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So when x is maximum, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)k A², so E = (1/2)k A².

When x is zero, the potential is zero, and kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So E = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma must be >=1, so this makes sense.

Now, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, I don't see this expression yet, but perhaps I can manipulate it.

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2], where x = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2 = [1 + 2x + x² -1 ] / (1 +x )^2 = (2x + x²) / (1 + x )^2 = x (2 + x) / (1 +x )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 + x )

With x = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Plugging in x:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ]

Simplify numerator under the square root:

(k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) ) = [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 (1 + x )^2 ] )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to factor.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c² ) + k A². Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps let me factor out 4 m c² from the numerator.

But perhaps looking back at the options would help.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, that seems complicated.

Option B: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, not quite.

Option C: sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is the non-relativistic case. So probably not correct.

Option D: c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, looking at the expression I derived, which is:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Yes, so that would be our answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \), we have:
\[
\gamma m c^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]
Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{m c^2} + 1
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2
\]
Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}
\]
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**:
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}
\]

The other options are incorrect because:
- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators or terms.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case and does not account for the relativistic increase in mass.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
