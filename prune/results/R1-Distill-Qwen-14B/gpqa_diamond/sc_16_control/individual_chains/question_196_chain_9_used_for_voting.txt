Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it's obeying Hooke's law, which I know is F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. And we're supposed to find v_max. The options are a bit complicated with square roots and c, the speed of light, so it's definitely a relativity thing.

Wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), right? That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use the classical formula; I need to consider relativistic effects.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic. The total energy includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy when it's moving the fastest. But wait, actually, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized differently, but since this is a classical problem, maybe we don't have to worry about quantization.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation using the relativistic equation of motion. The force is given by F = -kx, but in relativity, the mass increases due to gamma. So the equation of motion might be more complicated.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, energy is conserved in a different way. Let me think about the maximum speed. At maximum amplitude x = A, the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. As it moves towards equilibrium, potential energy converts into kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy expression is different.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy at maximum speed. But wait, no, at maximum amplitude, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that formula comes from classical mechanics. Hmm, but if the system is relativistic, perhaps the potential energy is the same, but the kinetic energy is treated relativistically.

Wait, maybe I should write down the expressions for energy in terms of velocity. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1)mc². So, E = γ mc².

But wait, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So (1/2)kA² = γ mc². Wait, no, that can't be right because when x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is the potential energy plus rest energy?

Wait, no, in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy includes rest energy and kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again. The potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is relativistic, so K = (γ - 1)mc². The total energy E is the sum of K and U. So E = K + U = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

But at maximum amplitude x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that's the same as classical. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Because in that case, when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So then:

At x=0, all energy is kinetic: E = (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So solving for γ: γ = 1 + (1/(2m))kA².

Wait, but γ is 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2m).

Wait, but that can't be right because if kA²/(2m) is greater than 1, γ would be greater than 2, but if (kA²)/(2m) is positive, but I think that's possible if kA² is large enough. But wait, in reality, k and m are such that (kA²)/(2m) is less than 1, because otherwise the system would not oscillate classically anymore.

Wait, but maybe in the relativistic case, the condition for oscillation is different. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I should set the total energy equal to the sum of the rest energy and the maximum kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K_max, where K_max is the maximum kinetic energy. But E is also (1/2)kA², as the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, but that gives (1/2)kA² = mc² + K_max.

But K_max is (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to write out the equations.

At x = A (maximum displacement), the speed is zero, so all energy is potential and rest energy. So E = U + mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, is that correct? No, wait. In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is that. But in relativity, the total energy would include the rest energy. So maybe E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E = mc² + K = mc² + (γ - 1)mc² = γ mc².

So setting the two expressions for E equal:

γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Divide both sides by mc²:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²) * (1/2) Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (1/2)kA² = (kA²)/2. So,

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²) * (mc^2) ? No, I think I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, let me correct:

At x = A, E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x = 0, E = γ mc².

These are the same, so:

γ mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Subtract mc² from both sides:

γ mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Factor mc²:

mc² (γ - 1) = (1/2)kA².

But mc² (γ-1) is the relativistic kinetic energy K.

So K = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but K is (γ-1)mc². So,

(γ -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So,

γ -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Therefore,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)].

Square both sides:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)]².

Rearranging,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me factor out the denominator:

Let me denote B = kA²/(2 m c²). So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

Which can be written as:

v_max²/c² = [ (1 + B)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2.

Expanding (1+B)^2: 1 + 2B + B².

So,

[1 + 2B + B² - 1] / (1 + B)^2 = (2B + B²)/(1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator: B(2 + B).

So,

v_max²/c² = [ B (2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2.

But B is small compared to 1? Wait, not necessarily. Hmm, but in any case, let's plug back B = k A²/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c sqrt( [ B(2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] ) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, let me factor out kA²/(2m c²) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps simplifying:

B = (kA²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So,

v_max/c = sqrt( [ B (2 + B) ] ) / (1 + B).

Which is,

v_max/c = sqrt( B (2 + B) ) / (1 + B).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

v_max/c = sqrt( [ B (2 + B) ] ) / (1 + B).

But perhaps we can factor this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expressed differently. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, that denominator looks like 1 - something, which might be similar to gamma expressions.

Wait, let me see. Let me compute 1 + 1/(denominator).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression for v_max in another way.

Wait, from earlier, we had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

So, 1/gamma = 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]

And from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so 1/gamma = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [gamma]^2.

Wait, no, earlier steps:

We had:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )

So,

1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Let me compute 1/(1 + x)^2 where x is (kA²)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

v_max^2/c^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2x + x^2) -1 = 2x + x^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = (2x + x^2)/(1 + x)^2.

Factor numerator: x(2 + x).

Denominator: (1 + x)^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = x (2 + x) / (1 + x)^2.

Substituting x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2):

= [ (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2))) ] / (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

This seems complicated, but let's try to manipulate it.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 m c^2)^2 to eliminate denominators.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to take square roots.

v_max = c * sqrt( [ x (2 + x) ] ) / (1 + x )

Because (1 + x)^2 in denominator becomes (1 + x)^2, and the square root of numerator is sqrt(x(2 + x)).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( x(2 + x) ) / (1 + x )

Where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me plug x in:

sqrt( (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2))) ) / [1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) ]

Hmm, let's factor out 1/(2 m c^2) from the numerator inside the square root.

Wait, perhaps better to factor:

x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

sqrt( x (2 + x) ) = sqrt( (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ] )

= sqrt( [k A^2/(2 m c^2)] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ] )

Wait, let me compute 2 + x:

2 + x = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = (4 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2).

So,

sqrt( x (2 + x) ) = sqrt( [k A^2/(2 m c^2)] * [ (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] )

Multiply the terms inside the sqrt:

= sqrt( [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c^2) (2 m c^2) ) ] )

= sqrt( [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A²) ] ) / (2 m c^2 )

Take the numerator inside the sqrt:

= [ A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) ) ] / (2 m c² )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's see the denominator in the overall expression:

(1 + x) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c^2)

So,

v_max = c * [ sqrt( x (2 + x) ) ] / (1 + x )

= c * [ (A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² )) ) / (2 m c^2) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Hmm, let me simplify the denominator in the denominator:

The denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

[ ... ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] = [ ... ] * [ 2 m c^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ]

Putting it all together,

v_max = c * [ (A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² )) ) / (2 m c^2) ) ] * [ 2 m c^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]

Notice that 2 m c^2 cancels out:

= c * [ A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A^2 )) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, but the denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ), and the numerator inside sqrt is k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

Denominator: 2 m c^2 + k A^2.

Numerator inside sqrt: 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should look at the options again to see which form matches.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, let's compute the expression inside the sqrt of option B:

1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c^2)) )

Which is 1 + [1/( (2 m c^2 - k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= 1 + [ (2 m c^2)/(2 m c^2 - k A^2) ) ]

= [ (2 m c^2 - k A^2) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

= [4 m c^2 - k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

Hmm, that's the argument inside the sqrt for option B.

But in our expression, we have:

v_max^2/c^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x)^2, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

= c^2 * [ (k A^2) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2)^2 (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ]

Wait, this seems complicated. I'm not seeing an obvious match to any of the options yet.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should look for an option that has 1 + something involving (k A²/(2 m c^2)), but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe I should think about the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator.

The force is F = -k x, but the relativistic mass is gamma m.

So, F = d(momentum)/dt = d(gamma m v)/dt.

So, the equation of motion would be:

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But x is the position, and v = dx/dt.

This is a second-order differential equation, which might be more complicated than I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy approach is better.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the total energy E is given by (1/2)kA², same as classical, but considering that in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So,

E = (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same as before.

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Rearranged:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ]

Which is,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Expanding numerator: [1 + 2 (k A²/(2 m c^2)) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 - 1 ]

= [2 (k A²/(2 m c^2)) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Factor numerator:

= [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Which is:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] ) / [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))] .

Hmm, I think this is the expression I should compare with the options.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, let's compute what's inside the square root for option B.

Inside the sqrt: 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)).

Let me compute 1/(1 - x), where x = k A^2/(2 m c^2).

So,

1 + 1/(1 - x) = (1 - x + 1) / (1 - x) ) = (2 - x )/(1 - x).

So,

sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 - x) )

But for our v_max, the expression inside the sqrt is [x (2 +x) ]/(1 + x)^2.

So,

[x (2 +x)]/(1 + x)^2 = [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps none of the options match this, but I'm supposed to pick the closest one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct approach is different.

Wait, another approach: Using the virial theorem? No, probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the relativistic kinetic energy equals the potential energy. So, (gamma - 1) m c^2 = (1/2) k A².

Which would bring us to the same gamma as before.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Looking at option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, let's compute what's inside the sqrt for option D.

1 - [1/(1 + x)^2 ] where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1 - [1/(1 + x)^2 ] = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Which is [ 2x + x² ] / (1 + x)^2.

But that's exactly what we have for v_max^2/c^2. So,

v_max^2/c^2 = [2x + x^2 ]/(1 +x )^2.

Which is option D's expression.

Wait, option D is: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2x + x^2 ]/(1 +x )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( (2x + x^2)/(1 + x)^2 ) * c.

Which can be written as sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x ) * c.

Which is the same as our expression.

So, option D is matching.

Wait, but let me compute what option D says exactly.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²})^2 )

So,

Inside the sqrt of option D: 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 = ( (1 +x )^2 - 1 )/(1 +x )^2 = (2x + x^2)/(1 +x )^2.

Which is the same as v_max^2/c^2.

So yes, option D is correct.

But wait, earlier when I thought option B was the candidate, I thought perhaps I made a mistake. But now, D seems to fit.

Wait, but earlier when I worked through the expressions, the correct expression for v_max^2/c^2 is [2x + x²]/(1 + x)^2, where x = k A^2/(2 m c^2). So, option D matches that.

So, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the relativistic kinetic energy \( K \). At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. Thus:
   \[
   E = mc^2 + K = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

2. **Relating Kinetic Energy to Velocity**:  
   The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( K = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), we find:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Expressing \( \gamma \) in Terms of \( v \)**:  
   Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]

4. **Matching with the Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the options, we find that it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is consistent with the relativistic energy conservation principles and matches the form of Option D.

**Answer: D**
