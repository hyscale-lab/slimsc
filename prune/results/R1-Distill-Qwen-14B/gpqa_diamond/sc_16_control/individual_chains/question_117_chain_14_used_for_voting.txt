Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically whether a compound can rotate plane-polarized light. Let me think about each of the given compounds to determine if they exhibit this property.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to choose which ones show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of the four.

First, let me recall the basics. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, meso compounds can't show optical isomerism because they have an internal plane of symmetry. Also, some compounds without chiral centers can still show isomerism if they have geometric isomerism (cis-trans), but wait, geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism. Wait, no—optical isomerism is a subset of stereoisomerism. So, I think that geometric isomerism doesn't necessarily lead to optical activity unless there's some kind of asymmetry in the molecule.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify: for a compound to show optical activity, it must have at least one chiral center. So, if a compound doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't have optical isomerism. But wait, what about compounds with multiple stereocenters? Like if they have two stereocenters but are not meso forms. So, for example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters, but if both are the same, it's meso and doesn't show optical activity. But if the configuration is different, it might.

Wait, no. Let's think again. For a molecule to have optical isomers, it must have at least one chiral center. So the presence of such a center is key.

Now, let's go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Hmm, okay. So this is a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Specifically, each has a nitro group at 6' and 6, and a carboxylate (OOCR) at 2 and 2'. Wait, each ring has a nitro at position 6, and a carboxylate at position 2, and they're on a biphenyl. So the structure is two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each has a nitro and carboxylate group.

Wait, the substituents on each ring: each has a nitro (NO2) and a carboxylate (OOCR, where R is methyl) in the 2 and 6 positions. So, the question is, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, the molecule is a biphenyl, which is a structure where two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents are in symmetric positions. Wait, but the substituents on each ring are at the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, in biphenyls, the substituents can affect the ability to have isomerism.

Wait, but the point is, does the molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The central atom is the bridge between the two benzene rings. But that's a carbon (since biphenyls are connected via a single bond between the two benzene carbons). So, wait, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at their 1 positions. Each of those carbons (the ones attached to the other ring) has substituents: on each ring, the nitro is at position 6, and the carboxylate is at position 2.

Wait, so each of those bridge carbons (the ones attached to the other benzene) has four substituents: a benzene ring, a nitro group, a carboxylate group, and a hydrogen? Or maybe another group? Wait, no, the positions are 6 and 2. So if the benzene ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2, then the bridge carbon (position 1) would have what groups attached? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should try drawing the structure. But since I can't do that, I'll try to imagine it. The bridge is between two benzene rings. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6.

So, the bridge carbon (the carbon that's part of both rings) would have the two benzene rings attached (wait, no, each bridge carbon is part of one benzene ring. So, each bridge carbon is connected to the other bridge carbon. So each bridge carbon is part of their own benzene ring and connected to the other bridge carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the substituents on the bridge carbon. For the 1,1'-biphenyl, each bridge carbon (each part of the ring) is attached to the other bridge carbon. So, each bridge carbon is bonded to:

- Two other carbons in its benzene ring (the adjacent positions)
- The other bridge carbon (so two bridge carbons are connected)
- And another substituent, perhaps?

Wait, no, the bridge carbon is a single carbon in each ring. For example, in biphenyl, each benzene ring has a carbon at position 1 that's connected to the other ring's position 1. So, each bridge carbon is connected to two other carbons in its ring, and to the other bridge carbon. That's three substituents. So, what's the fourth? Oh, wait, maybe that's a hydrogen. So, each bridge carbon has three substituents: two from the ring and the other bridge carbon, and a hydrogen. If that's the case, then the bridge carbon isn't a chiral center because it's bonded to two identical groups (the two aromatic rings) and a hydrogen. Wait, no, the two bridge carbons are connected, but each bridge carbon is part of its own benzene ring. So, each bridge carbon is attached to two other carbons in its ring, the other bridge carbon, and maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, each bridge carbon is part of its own benzene ring, which is connected via a single bond to the other bridge carbon. So each bridge carbon has:

- One bond to the other bridge carbon (the 1' position)
- Two bonds to adjacent carbons in their own ring (like the 2 and 6 positions)
- And the fourth bond is a substituent.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me correct. In a biphenyl, each ring has a carbon at position 1, connected to the other ring's position 1. So each bridge carbon (position 1 of each ring) is connected to the other bridge carbon. So each bridge carbon has three substituents: the two adjacent carbons in its own ring (like positions 2 and 6), and the other bridge carbon.

Wait, that's three bonds. So each bridge carbon is bonded to three other atoms, so the fourth bond must be a hydrogen. So each bridge carbon has a hydrogen attached.

So, in this case, for the first compound, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. So, the bridge carbon (position 1) in each ring is attached to:

- Two adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6)
- The other bridge carbon
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but in this compound, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, the bridge carbon (position 1) has substituents from the ring, but also are the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) on their respective positions.

Wait, perhaps the bridge carbon itself doesn't have any substituents. So, each bridge carbon just has three connections: the two adjacent carbons in the ring (positions 2 and 6), and the other bridge carbon. The fourth substituent is a hydrogen.

So, in that case, the bridge carbon is CH, not a chiral center. So, no chiral centers in the bridge.

But wait, looking at the substituents: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2.

So, for each ring, position 2 is a carboxylate (OOCR), position 6 is a nitro. So, are any of these positions on the ring attached to a carbon that's a chiral center? Let me think about position 2.

The carbon at position 2 on each ring is attached to the ring, a carboxylate group (OOCR), and two other ring carbons (positions 1 and 3). Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is attached to two adjacent carbons and one substituent, but in this case, position 2 would have a substituent. So, the structure is benzene with substituents at 2 and 6.

Wait, the carbon at position 2 on each ring is attached to:

- The ring (so two adjacent carbons)
- The substituent (carboxylate)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Carbon in a benzene ring is sp² hybridized. So each ring carbon is bonded to three other atoms: two adjacent carbons and one substituent (if any). So, the carbon at position 2 has two ring carbons, the substituent (carboxylate), and a hydrogen? Or is it part of a double bond?

Wait, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to one substituent, with the rest being H. So, in this case, the position 2 and 6 on each ring have substituents. So each substituent is either a nitro or a carboxylate.

So, the substituent at position 2 is the carboxylate group, which is OOCR. So, that substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring. The carbon where the substituent is attached is part of the ring and has three substituents: two from the ring (positions 1 and 3), and the substituent (carboxylate). So, that's an sp² carbon, not a chiral center because it's trigonal planar.

So, the question is: does this compound have any chiral centers?

Wait, maybe the substituent itself could have a chiral center. Let me look at the substituent. The substituent is a carboxylate group, OOCR. For the first compound, it's a methyl group attached to the carboxylate. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the substituent is the carboxylate ester group: O-CO-OCH3. So, the structure is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene.

But the ester group itself is O-CO-OCH3. The central carbon in the ester (the one attached to the oxygen) would be a carbonyl group, which is double-bonded, so it's sp² hybridized. So, that's not a chiral center.

So, the substituents themselves don't have chiral centers. So the molecule as a whole might not have any chiral centers. But wait, the bridge between the two rings—could that create any kind of asymmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the two rings are connected in a symmetric way. Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, the arrangement might be such that the molecule has a center of symmetry. So, any mirror plane?

Wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then it wouldn't have optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, the molecule would be achiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are identical. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, looking at the molecule, if you rotate it 180 degrees around the central axis (the bond between the two rings), would the substituents swap places? Wait, maybe not. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the two substituents on each ring are in such positions that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another approach. For a compound to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center. If the molecule doesn't have a chiral center but has a plane of symmetry, it can't have optical isomerism.

In this case, the molecule is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical?

Wait, let's imagine the two rings. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the central bond, each substituent would swap places. So, the nitro on the first ring would swap with the nitro on the second ring, and same with the carboxylates.

But wait, that would imply a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks symmetry. For example, if the nitro and carboxylate are on the same face of the ring, but that might not be the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the possibility of the molecule having multiple stereoisomers. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the substituents are at 6 and 2, but in the biphenyl structure, the position 6 is the para position relative to the bridge. So, if the bridge is at position 1, then position 6 is opposite to it. So, the nitro at 6 and the carboxylate at 2 would be on adjacent positions relative to the bridge.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. If that's the case, no optical isomerism.

So, for compound 1, I'm not entirely certain, but I'll tentatively say it doesn't show optical isomerism. Or maybe it does. Hmm.

Moving on to the next compound.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the structure is an ester. Let's break it down. Propanoate has three carbons. The formula is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester, it's OMe group attached.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO- as the acid, but as an ester, it's methyl ester. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)

Wait, no, wait. Let me structure it properly. The acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be the methyl ester: HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the acid: HO-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

OCH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So, the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would have the methyl group attached to the COO-.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is: 

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain? No, propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the ester group, and the rest is CH2(OH)CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's easier to think about whether there's a chiral center.

In the molecule, the carbon chain would be:

COOCH3 connected to CH2 connected to CH2OH.

Wait, more accurately, it's CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the carbonyl is at the end. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

COOCH3 is the ester group, attached to CH2CH2OH.

Wait, perhaps to see if any carbon is a chiral center, I need to look at each carbon.

The carbonyl carbon (COOCH3) is double-bonded, so not a chiral center.

The CH2 next to the COOCH3: in CH2CH2COOCH3, the middle carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (as a single bond)
- two CH2 groups (but wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, which would be two CH2 groups? Wait, no, it's CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, meaning the middle CH2 is between the OH and the COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, the middle carbon (the second CH2) has:

- two CH2 groups (wait, no, the first CH2 is attached to the OH and the next CH2, which is attached to the COOCH3.

Wait, let me think about each carbon:

Carbon 1: CH2 attached to OH and Carbon 2.

Carbon 2: CH2 attached to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is on Carbon 3.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me number the carbons.

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3.

The acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me structure it correctly.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so when it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on Carbon 2.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is on Carbon 3.

Carbon 2 has the hydroxyl group.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make it a three-carbon chain. No, wait, the ester is propanoate, so the acid is propanoic acid, which is three carbons. So, the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH2, attached to:

- Carbon 1 (CH2OH)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, so Carbon 2 is a CH2 group with two hydrogens, a CH2OH group, and a COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- Two CH2 groups (but wait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1, which is CH2OH, and Carbon 3, which is COOCH3, and two hydrogens.

Wait, no, wait. Carbon 2 is bonded to:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH (so that's a CH2 group)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3 (another CH2 group)
- And two hydrogens.

So, Carbon 2 has four substituents: two CH2 groups, two hydrogens. Wait, no, that can't be right because Carbon 2 is a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should look for chiral centers in this molecule.

The possible chiral centers are any carbon with four different substituents.

In this molecule, Carbon 2 is a CH2 group, so it's bonded to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups on either side?), which is not possible because Carbon 1 is CH2OH, and Carbon 3 is COOCH3. So, Carbon 2 would be attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

So, substituents are:

- CH2OH
- COOCH3
- H
- H.

So, two of the substituents are H. So, Carbon 2 isn't a chiral center because two substituents are the same (H).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So, Carbon 2 is the middle CH2. Its substituents are:

- Two CH2 groups (no, wait, each CH2 is attached to other groups).

Wait, Carbon 2 is attached to:

- Carbon 1: which is CH2OH. So, substituent is CH2OH.

- Carbon 3: which is CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the middle CH2 is between the CH2OH and the COOCH3.

So, Carbon 2 is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups? Or no, wait, Carbon 2 is a CH2 group, so it has two CH2 groups as substituents?

Wait, no, Carbon 2 is a CH2 connected to Carbon 1 (CH2OH) and Carbon 3 (COOCH3). So, substituents would be:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH (so, that's a group)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3 (another group)
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's are the same. Therefore, Carbon 2 isn't a chiral center.

So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another moment. What about the ester group? Is there any possibility of a chiral center elsewhere?

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbonyl group isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded. The oxygen is connected to the methyl group, but that's not a chiral center either.

So, in this molecule, there are no chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, wait. What about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry? No, because the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no symmetry. But if there's no chiral center, then even if the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can't have optical isomerism. So, in this case, compound 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: the molecule is a diastereomer if it has multiple stereocenters. But if there's only one stereocenter and it's not present, then no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking at Carbon 2: substituents are:

- One CH2OH group (from Carbon 1)
- One COOCH3 group (from Carbon 3)
- Two H atoms.

So, substituents are CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. Since two substituents are the same (H), it's not a chiral center.

So, compound 2 doesn't have any chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. What about the possibility of the molecule being a meso compound? No, because a meso compound requires multiple stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry. If there's only one carbon and it's not a chiral center, then no.

So, moving on to compound 3: benzophenone.

Benzophenone is a diaryl ketone, with the structure (Ph)2CO. So, two benzene rings attached to a ketone group.

The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. So, the central carbon is a carbonyl carbon (sp² hybridized), which isn't a chiral center. Each benzene ring is attached to the central carbon, but the rings themselves are symmetric.

So, benzophenone has no chiral centers. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, does benzophenone have any stereoisomerism? No, because the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Now, compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is an ester derived from fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, both -OH groups are replaced by OMe.

So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and each has a carboxylic acid group (or ester group in this case).

So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure: CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2?

No, wait, I think more accurately, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 ?

Wait, no. Let me think clearly.

Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the two carboxylic acid groups are on either end of a double bond.

So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, the actual structure is:

Each of the two ends of the double bond has a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but no, it's more like:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

No, no, wait, fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

No, wait, no. The correct structure is:

Each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2=CH with each CH2 connected to a COOCH3.

Wait, no. The correct structure is:

The molecule is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is trans, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but regardless of that, the key point is whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (CH2=CH) with each CH2 having a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

No, that's not correct. Let me correct.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, no, that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester. Fumarate is different.

Ah, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the molecule.

Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically trans-2,3-dicarboxylic acid. So, the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH (that's succinic acid), but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the two CH groups.

So, when esterified with methanol, each -OH is replaced by OCH3.

So, the structure becomes:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let's structure it properly.

The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no, fumarate is not a single bond. The correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

No, that's not right. The correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me.

No, that's succinate. Fumerate has a double bond.

So, correct structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the two middle carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

Now, the question is: does this molecule have any chiral centers?

The carbons in the double bond are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me look at each carbon.

The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2=CH
|
COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

But with a double bond in the middle.

No, I think the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is:

The molecule is (E)-butenedioic acid as the acid, and its dimethyl ester would be (E)-dimethyl fumarate.

The structure is:

O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

No, that's not correct. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,2-dimethylfumaramide? No, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecule's geometry.

Each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group.

So, each of these carbons has:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- Two bonds to the double bond.

Wait, each of the double-bond carbons is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group
- And two double bonds (which are between the two carbons).

So, each of these carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and CH2. So, each has two substituents and two double bonds.

Wait, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents (COOCH3 and CH2), making them sp² hybridized. So, neither of these carbons is a chiral center because they're double-bonded and not tetrahedral.

So, the molecule dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, wait a minute. Because the groups on each side of the double bond can be arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, but without a chiral center, the molecule can't have optical isomerism. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But optically active compounds require a chiral center, not just geometric isomerism. So, if the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, even if it has E/Z isomerism, it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: some molecules without chiral centers can still have optical activity if they have a plane of symmetry. No, wait, no, optical activity arises from asymmetry caused by chiral centers. So, without chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, what if the molecule has a center of asymmetry without a chiral center? I don't think that's possible. Because a chiral center is a specific type of asymmetry.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 1. Let's go back to it.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Hmm, so each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring is attached to the other via a single bond at position 1.

Wait, so each ring's position 1 is connected to the other ring's position 1. So, the bridge is between the two 1 positions.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro).

So, looking at the molecule, the substituents on each ring are on opposite ends relative to the bridge.

Wait, this might create a situation where the molecule has no internal plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Another way to think about it: if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the two rings connected. If each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then the substituents are on opposite sides relative to the bridge.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric across the central bond. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirrored across the bond, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that they are not mirror images, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, imagine the two rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The positions 2 and 6 are across from each other on the ring.

So, if both rings have substituents in the same relative positions (like both nitro groups in the same position relative to the bridge), the molecule might be symmetric.

But if the substituents are arranged such that one ring has nitro in a certain position and the other has it mirrored, perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the nitro and carboxylate groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If a plane can be drawn through the molecule such that one half is a mirror image of the other, then it's achiral.

In this case, the molecule has two rings connected. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are arranged in a way that they are mirror images across the central bond, the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are on the same side of each ring, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, making it achiral despite having stereogenic elements.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Another approach: look for whether the compound is a known optical isomer.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a diastereomer, but if it doesn't have a chiral center, then no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, for the four options:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate — unsure, but perhaps it's symmetrical and lacks a chiral center.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate — no chiral center.

3. benzophenone — no chiral center.

4. dimethyl fumarate — no chiral center.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm forgetting something. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but that doesn't create a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, what about the possibility of the molecule being a racemic mixture? No, because without chiral centers, no.

So, out of the four compounds, which ones have optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. Maybe the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, the molecule is a biphenyl. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions relative to the bridge.

Hmm. Let me consider whether the substituents on the rings create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the bridge carbon itself is a chiral center. Let me think: each bridge carbon (position 1 on each ring) is attached to:

- Two adjacent carbons in their own ring (positions 2 and 6)
- The other bridge carbon
- A hydrogen.

So, substituents are:

- Two benzene rings (but wait, each bridge carbon is part of its own benzene ring, so perhaps the substituents are the two adjacent carbons, which are part of the ring.)

Wait, so each bridge carbon is attached to:

Carbon 2 (ring substituent), Carbon 6 (ring substituent), the other bridge carbon, and a hydrogen.

But wait, in the biphenyl structure, each bridge carbon is connected to two ring carbons (positions 2 and 6), the other bridge carbon, and a hydrogen. So, substituents are: two ring carbons, another bridge carbon, and H.

But that would make four substituents, but two are identical (the two ring carbons are the same in each case?), which would mean the bridge carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, no, because the substituents on the bridge carbon are:

- Two ring carbons (each connected to substituents)
- Another bridge carbon
- A hydrogen.

But the two ring carbons are each attached to substituents (nitro and carboxylate), so they are different from each other.

Wait, so substituents on the bridge carbon (position 1) are:

- Ring carbon 2 (which has a carboxylate group)
- Ring carbon 6 (which has a nitro group)
- The other bridge carbon (position 1')
- A hydrogen.

So, the four substituents are:

1. Ring carbon 2 (with carboxylate)
2. Ring carbon 6 (with nitro)
3. Other bridge carbon (position 1')
4. Hydrogen.

So, all four substituents are different. Therefore, the bridge carbon (position 1) is a chiral center.

If that's the case, then the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 would show optical isomerism.

Then, let's reassess the four compounds.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate — has a chiral center. So, optical isomerism possible.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate — no chiral center. No optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone — no chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate — no chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought dimethyl fumarate had a double bond but no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I thought fumarate is the trans isomer. But that's about geometric isomerism, not optical.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 4?

Wait, no, according to the analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center.

Wait, but earlier I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. So, only compound 1 would have optical isomerism.

But let's look at the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 1 is correct. But looking back, I think I made a mistake regarding compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism. So, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and none of them are just compound 1. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2.

Wait, none of the options have only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Did I correctly assess compound 4?

Dimethyl fumarate (compound 4): structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3). So, each of the central carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, but the central carbons are each attached to two substituents. So, each has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and two bonds in the double bond.

So, each of these carbons is bonded to three groups: COOCH3, CH2, and two double bonds. So, they're sp² hybridized. So, no chiral center.

But wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might be symmetric.

Wait, no, because the substituents on each side are the same. So, the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 1 has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

But the options don't include an option where only 1 is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, which creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, no, because the substituents on the double bond are each COOCH3 and CH2 groups, which are the same on both sides.

Wait, perhaps there's a chiral center in the ester groups. Let me think.

Each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbon in the ester (the one attached to the oxygen) is a carbonyl group, which is sp² hybridized. So, no chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Maybe the correct answer is only compound 1, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and another compound has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me re-examine it.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H.

Since two substituents are H, it's not a chiral center. So, no.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having a stereogenic element. But without a chiral center, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. According to my analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, each of the carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But perhaps if the molecule is arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

No, I don't think so. Because the ester groups are symmetrical on each end.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, only 1 is correct. So, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The middle carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. Since two substituents are H, it's not a chiral center.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this molecule can form a cyclic intermediate, but that's irrelevant here.

So, perhaps the only correct answer is compound 1.

But looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4, which according to my analysis, only 1 is correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed that compound 4 has a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again about compound 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, perhaps the central CH2 groups have substituents that make them chiral.

No, because the central CH2 groups are each attached to a COOCH3, a double bond, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the structure is more accurately:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

But with a double bond in the middle, making it a trans configuration.

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

So, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group attached.

Wait, so each of these carbons is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group
- And two bonds in the double bond.

So, each of these carbons has two substituents (COOCH3 and CH2), but since they're sp² hybridized, they're not chiral centers.

So, no chiral centers in compound 4.

Hmm, this is confusing. Based on my analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option with just 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate can have any stereoisomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is an ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dioic acid. So, the double bond is in the trans configuration.

So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, thus no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the only correct answer is compound 1, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 2. Let's think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The middle CH2 is attached to:

- CH2OH
- COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H.

So, two H's, so not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait another moment. If the molecule is (R) or (S) configuration, but I don't think it's possible because of the substituents.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center, so only 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 1. The closest is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, 2 and 4 don't have chiral centers. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the double bond have substituents that make them chiral.

Wait, no, because each of these carbons is bonded to two substituents (COOCH3 and CH2), and two double bonds. So, they're sp² hybridized and not chiral centers.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer in a different way. The question provides four options, and I need to choose which compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2.

Only option A includes compound 1, which I thought has a chiral center. But according to my analysis, only 1 has it. So, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a chiral molecule. So, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 1. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The bridge carbon has substituents: two ring carbons, another bridge carbon, and a hydrogen. But wait, the ring carbons are each attached to substituents (nitro and carboxylate). So, the substituents on the bridge carbon are:

- CH2 (with nitro)
- CH2 (with carboxylate)
- Another bridge carbon
- H.

But wait, wait, the bridge carbon is attached to two ring carbons. Each ring carbon is attached to a substituent (nitro and carboxylate). So, each of these ring carbons is a different substituent on the bridge carbon.

So, the bridge carbon has four different substituents:

1. Ring carbon with nitro
2. Ring carbon with carboxylate
3. Other bridge carbon
4. Hydrogen.

Therefore, the bridge carbon is a chiral center. So, compound 1 has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that compound 4 also has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond have a chiral center.

The CH2 groups are attached to the COOCH3 and the double bond. So, each CH2 is attached to:

- COOCH3
- Double bond (two CH groups)
- Two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, CH, H, H. So, two H's, so not a chiral center.

No, that's not a chiral center.

Hmm.

At this point, based on my analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options match that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 1.

Wait, perhaps the molecule in compound 1 is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure: two benzene rings connected at position 1, each with a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it would be achiral.

If the substituents on each ring are mirror images across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center, meaning no optical isomerism.

In that case, none of the four compounds would exhibit optical isomerism, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to known examples. For instance, biphenyl derivatives with substituents in certain positions can exhibit optical isomerism.

In compound 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has no internal plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

So, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetric, it would have a chiral center at the bridge carbon.

Therefore, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the four, only compound 1 has a chiral center. But the options don't include an option with only 1. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and all four compounds don't exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Wait, checking the options again:

A) 1,2,4 — I think 1 is correct, 2 and 4 aren't.

B)3,4 — No.

C)2,3 — No.

D)1,2 — Only 1 is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 1. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 2 also has a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again about compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The middle CH2 is attached to:

- CH2OH
- COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, substituents are CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. Two substituents are H, so not a chiral center.

Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center.

So, after reevaluating, only compound 1 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

But none of the options match, which is confusing. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I missed that compounds 2 and 4 also have chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, perhaps the double bond geometry allows for some sort of chirality, but without a chiral center, I don't think so.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options reflect that, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, considering that compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

But since they're double-bonded, they're sp² hybridized and not chiral centers.

So, no, compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

Therefore, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 1. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Based on the initial analysis, only compound 1 has a chiral center, so the correct answer should be option A if I'm wrong about the others, but I think the correct answer is that only compound 1 does. But since the options don't have that, I'll have to choose the best possible option.

After considering everything, the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but in reality, I think compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck and proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has at least one chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let us evaluate each compound:

---

### 1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1 (1,1'-biphenyl). Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. The bridge carbon (position 1 on each ring) is attached to:  
- Two adjacent carbons in its benzene ring (positions 2 and 6),  
- The other bridge carbon,  
- A hydrogen atom.  

The substituents on the bridge carbon are:  
1. A carbon attached to a carboxylate group (position 2),  
2. A carbon attached to a nitro group (position 6),  
3. The other bridge carbon,  
4. A hydrogen atom.  

Since all four substituents are different, the bridge carbon is a **chiral center**. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### 2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of this compound is CH₃-O-CO-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. The middle carbon (CH₂) is attached to:  
- A hydroxyl group (-OH),  
- A carboxylic acid ester group (COOCH₃),  
- Two hydrogen atoms.  

The substituents on the middle carbon are:  
1. -OH,  
2. COOCH₃,  
3. H,  
4. H.  

Since two substituents are identical (H), this carbon is **not a chiral center**. Therefore, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 3. **benzophenone**  
Benzophenone is a diaryl ketone with the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a benzene ring. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical benzene rings. Since the central carbon is sp² hybridized and not bonded to four different groups, it is **not a chiral center**. Therefore, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 4. **dimethyl fumarate**  
Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃-OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The two central carbons in the double bond are each attached to:  
- A carboxylate ester group (COOCH₃),  
- A CH₂ group,  
- Two bonds in the double bond.  

These carbons are sp² hybridized and bonded to only two substituents (COOCH₃ and CH₂), meaning they are **not chiral centers**. Since the molecule lacks any chiral centers, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Conclusion  
- Compound 1 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.  
- Compounds 2, 3, and 4 do not have chiral centers and therefore do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

The correct answer is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, but based on the analysis, only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. However, since the options provided do not include an answer with only compound 1, we select the closest option.

ANSWER: A
