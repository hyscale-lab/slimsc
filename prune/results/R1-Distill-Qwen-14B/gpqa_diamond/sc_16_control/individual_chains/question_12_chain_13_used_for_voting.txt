Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, the reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is at rest initially, right?

Alright, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So, the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta to sum back to zero. That makes sense because if one particle is moving in one direction, the other must move in the opposite direction to balance things out.

The rest masses are given: the pion (Pi(+)) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon (mu(+)) has 105.7 MeV. Wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? I think neutrinos are considered massless in many of these problems, or at least their mass is so small it's ignored. So, the neutrino's energy would just be its kinetic energy plus any rest mass energy, but since its rest mass is negligible, its energy is approximately its kinetic energy.

So the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But because energy is conserved, the sum of their energies should equal 139.6 MeV.

Now, each of their energies is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. So, for the muon, its total energy E_mu is E_rest_mu + K_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's energy E_nu is just K_nu (since its rest energy is negligible). 

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. Which means, (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu = 139.6. Simplifying that, K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

But wait, that's only one equation. I need another to find both K_mu and K_nu. Oh right, because of momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The magnitude of the momentum p is the same for both particles. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu is equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c=1 (MeV and such), E_nu = p. For the muon, its energy is sqrt(p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4). Again, since c=1, that's sqrt(p² + m_mu²). So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

So putting it all together, the energies are E_mu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) and E_nu = p.

We know that E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. So,

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, this looks like an equation I can solve for p. Let me make a substitution. Let me let x = p. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I'll subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

The x² terms cancel out on both sides. So,

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute these squares numerically.

105.7 squared is approximately 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that:

100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2 = 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

139.6 squared: 140^2 is 19600, minus 0.4*(2*139.6 +0.4). Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 139.6 * 139.6.

Wait, 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So, (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2.

140^2 is 19600.

2*140*0.4 is 112.

0.4^2 is 0.16.

So, 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So now plug back into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 2*139.6: that's 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x.

Compute 11172.49 - 19488.16: that's -8315.67.

So,

-8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = (-8315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, subtract 279.2: 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 279.2 * 29.7 is approximately 8315.64.

So x ≈29.7 MeV/c. So p is approximately 29.7 MeV/c.

Now, going back to E_nu = p = 29.7 MeV. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is about 29.7 MeV. But wait, wait. Wait, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible. So the neutrino's KE is 29.7 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 29.7 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV

C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV

D)4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV

Wait, option D has 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Hmm. So the neutrino's KE is about 29.7 MeV; option D says 29.8, which is very close. So perhaps that's the neutrino's KE.

But wait, no, wait. The question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So the muon and the neutrino. So the muon's KE is K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2. Since E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), which we have as sqrt(29.7^2 + 105.7^2).

Compute that: 29.7 squared is about 882.09. 105.7 squared is 11172.49. So sum is 882.09 + 11172.49 = 12054.58. Square root of that is sqrt(12054.58) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So E_mu is 109.8 MeV, and E_nu is 29.7 MeV. Sum is 109.8 +29.7 =139.5 MeV, which is roughly correct, considering rounding.

So the muon's energy is 109.8 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

Hmm, so K_mu is approximately 4.1 MeV. And K_nu is 29.7 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close. So the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV and the neutrino is 29.8 MeV. So option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Especially the equation solving part.

The equation was sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) +x =139.6.

When I squared both sides, I had x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 -x)^2 → x² + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtracting x² from both sides, 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

So 279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49 → 19488.16 -11172.49 is 8315.67.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 → which is approximately 29.7 MeV/c.

So yes, that seems right.

So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, neutrino's KE is about 29.7 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu,
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino's mass is negligible.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (equal to the neutrino's momentum due to conservation of momentum). The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]

Thus, the energy equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Let \(x = p\). Substituting \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]

Square both sides:
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expand the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]

Cancel \(x^2\) and rearrange:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]

Simplify:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
279.2x = 8315.67,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, \(p \approx 29.7 \, \text{MeV}/c\).

### Kinetic Energies
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\nu} = p = 29.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the muon, its total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.7^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Compute:
\[
29.7^2 = 882.09, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{882.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12054.58} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.1 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.7 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \(2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV}\) — Incorrect.
- **Option B**: \(7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV}\) — Incorrect.
- **Option C**: \(3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV}\) — Incorrect.
- **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) — Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
