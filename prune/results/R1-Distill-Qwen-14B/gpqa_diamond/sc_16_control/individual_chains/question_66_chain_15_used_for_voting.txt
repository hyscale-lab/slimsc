Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) interactions plus higher-dimensional operators that parameterize beyond the SM physics. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries involved.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it while maintaining Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional terms, which are also Poincare-invariant, right? Because the effective theory is constructed to maintain the same symmetries as the SM. So operators in SMEFT should be Poincare invariant. So option 2 is correct too.

Wait, but wait. Do all SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Oh, because the Lagrangian itself must be Poincare-invariant. Because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory. So yeah, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. So that's the first two.

Then, CP symmetry. I'm not so sure. The SM has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So if the SM already has CP violation, then the SMEFT operators should respect the same symmetries as the SM, but maybe not necessarily include all SM symmetries, except those that are part of the underlying theory. Wait, but the SMEFT is an effective theory that approximates the SM at low energies. So operators in SMEFT must respect the same gauge symmetries as the SM, but what about other symmetries like CP?

The SM doesn't have a fundamental CP symmetry because there's CP violation. So in the SM, CP isn't a symmetry, therefore SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP either. So the operators in SMEFT might not necessarily respect CP symmetry, meaning it's not a must. So option 3 may not be correct. But wait, is there any reason SMEFT operators must respect CP? I think they don't have to. Because the effective theory accounts for possible beyond the SM physics which could include CP violation. So the operators can violate CP. So 3 is not a required symmetry.

Finally, CPT symmetry. CPT is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Any Lorentz-invariant QFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because the theory is built on the principles including causality and such. So regardless of the theory, if it's Lorentz invariant, it must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together: all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. CP (3) isn't necessarily required.

Looking at the options, option C) says 1,2,4. Option C is choice C: 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to extend the Standard Model (SM) while maintaining the same fundamental symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, let us analyze each option:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it is an effective field theory that extends the SM, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant field theory, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM already exhibits CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an effective theory that approximates the SM at low energies, it does not need to enforce CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP, so CP symmetry is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement for any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is:
