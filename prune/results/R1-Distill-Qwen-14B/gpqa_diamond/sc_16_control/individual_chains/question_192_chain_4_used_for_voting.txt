Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially with cavities, the charges can redistribute in certain ways. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor's radius is R, and the cavity is radius r, with its center a distance s away from the conductor's center. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, and from the cavity's center it's l. The angle between l and s is theta. So the point P is somewhere outside, but the arrangement of the conductor and cavity must influence the field there.

I remember from Gauss's law that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we put +q inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, in a conductor, charges can move freely. So the presence of +q in the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor's material's charges (electrons) would be attracted to the +q. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. So total charge outside would be +q.

But wait, how does that affect the electric field outside? Because when considering a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (like at point P), the total enclosed charge would be the sum of the charges inside the conductor. The conductor itself has a net charge of zero? Or wait, no, the conductor starts neutral, then the +q in the cavity induces -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer. So the total charge on the conductor is +q on the outer surface.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So it has no net charge. When +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q (because the cavity's charge attracts electrons), and the outer surface would have +q to balance the conductor's charge (since the conductor as a whole is neutral, because the initial charge was zero). Oh wait, no. Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, which leaves the conductor's net charge as -q. But wait, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. Because inner is -q, so outer must be +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero.

So when considering a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the total enclosed charge is +q. So the electric field outside should behave as if all the charge is concentrated at the center, right? Because for a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly, so the field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so when we apply Gauss's law, the flux through the Gaussian surface (which is a sphere of radius L) should be equal to Q_enc / epsilon_0. The Q_enc is +q, because the outer surface has +q. So the electric field E at P would be (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * q / L², because for a point outside, E is like that of a point charge.

Wait, but the answer options don't all show that. Let's look at the options. Option B is (1/(4 pi epsilon_0 )) * q/(L^2). That's exactly what I thought. But what about the other options? Option D is (1/(4 pi epsilon_0 )) * q / l². l is the distance from the cavity's center. Hmm, but the Gaussian surface is at L, not l. So I think B is correct, but let me think again.

Wait, but the point P is not necessarily aligned with the cavity's center. The distance l is from the cavity's center to P, and the angle theta is between l and s (the distance between the centers). So perhaps the field due to the charge in the cavity isn't straightforward.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges rearrange themselves. The point P is outside the conductor, so the field at P is due to the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. The Gaussian surface includes all charges inside the conductor, which is +q on the outer surface. So the field should depend only on q and L, not on l or theta.

But wait, wait. Let me think about this. The charge +q is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. Because for a conductor, the field outside depends only on the total charge and radius of the conductor, not on internal distributions. So the field at P is E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * q / L².

So option B should be correct.

But what about the other options? Option A and C involve (l - s cos theta) squared. That seems like the formula for the field due to a point charge located at a certain position, perhaps using the law of cosines to find the distance from the charge to P. But since the charge is inside the conductor, and the conductor's outer surface has the charge, the field outside is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So l and theta don't come into play for the field outside.

So yeah, the answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (due to electrostatic induction). To maintain the conductor's neutrality, a charge of $+q$ appears on the outer surface of the conductor.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly. This means that the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, which is $+q$. Using Gauss's law, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor) is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

3. **Relevance of Other Parameters**: The distance $l$ (distance from the cavity's center to $P$) and the angle $\theta$ (between $l$ and $s$, the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity) do not affect the electric field at $P$. This is because the field outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is uniformly distributed.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not $l$ or $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which is correct.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field depends on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
