Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, giving a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR absorbance at 1720 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. The IR at 1720 suggests an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, or maybe a carbonyl group. 1720 is around where esters and ketones appear. But given that the starting material is a dibromide, maybe it's an elimination reaction.

So when dibromides react with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation, they typically form alkenes. But wait, that's elimination. Alternatively, in some cases, if there's a possibility for more than one elimination, maybe forming a diene? Or perhaps a cyclic structure.

Wait, but what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the diamond lattice. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would likely cause elimination, removing H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond.

But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Or is the structure such that elimination leads to a bridged structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But KOH is a base; substitution would require a good leaving group. Wait, no, substitution with KOH would give a hydroxide, but in such a structure, substitution would just give a diol. But the IR peak is at 1720, which doesn't fit a diol. Diols usually don't have strong IR peaks around 1720. So elimination is more likely.

So on elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, we get an alkene. But wait, the product 1 has an IR peak at 1720. That suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction isn't just elimination but something else. Or perhaps the structure of adamantane leads to something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but that's more like a Hofmann elimination or something. Wait, wait—that's more for amides. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction isn't just elimination but a ring-opening. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone? But wait, where would the carbonyls come from?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it forms an epoxide? No, that's usually done with peracids or other epoxidizing agents. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, let's think about the NMR spectrum of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OCH2- group, maybe an ether or an ester. Wait, but the IR has 1720, which is more like an ester or ketone.

Wait, if the product is an epoxide, the protons on the O would be around 3-4 ppm, but maybe higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but then why the IR at 1720?

Wait, maybe the structure is a ketone. But how? Let me think: if two Br atoms are eliminated, as two HBr molecules. So, perhaps the structure is an adamantane with a bridge that forms a carbonyl group. Wait, but how?

Wait, considering that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, perhaps the elimination forms a ring with a carbonyl group. So, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound with a ketone?

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. No, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring opening to form a ketone or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the IR peak. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So definitely, there's a carbonyl group in product 1.

So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require the formation of an alcohol. However, the IR suggests a carbonyl, which doesn't fit a simple substitution product. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution followed by elimination. Wait, but substitution would form an alcohol, then elimination would form an alkene, but that doesn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the product isn't a simple alkene but a cyclic ketone. Let me think: if two adjacent Br atoms are removed, perhaps two HBr molecules are eliminated, and a carbonyl is formed. Wait, how? For a carbonyl to form, perhaps the adjacent carbons after elimination would have to have a double bond, but that's an alkene, not a ketone. Unless it's a bridge structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone, like norbornene with a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the product is adamantane with two carbonyl groups. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, such that two HBr molecules are removed, and the two carbon centers form a carbonyl each. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diol. Then, when heated with KOH, maybe something else happens. But the IR doesn't suggest a diol. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1250-1050 cm^-1, not 1720.

Wait, what about a Grignard reaction? No, KOH is a base, not a metal.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would need two hydroxides, but again, the IR doesn't align.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes a coupling reaction. But more likely, it's elimination.

Wait, another angle. The NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H). That looks like an -OCH2- group. So perhaps it's an ether. But then why the IR at 1720? Maybe an ester's carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a diester? Or a cyclic ester?

Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or ketal. But the IR would show a different peak for that.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diether. But that wouldn't explain the 1720 cm^-1.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone and an alcohol. But the NMR doesn't immediately show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with an ester group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridge structure. Let's think, if we eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the structure becomes a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure with an ester group. But I'm not making much progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that would need two epoxide groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, in some cases, when two adjacent halides are present, eliminating two HX molecules can form a carbonyl group. For example, in the case of 1,3-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr would give propene, but that's in a chain. But in a cyclic or diamondoid structure like adamantane, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that eliminating two Br atoms leads to a bridgehead with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridged bicyclic ketone. Let me imagine the structure: after eliminating two HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the two carbons where Br was attached form a double bond, but in the diamondoid structure, that might create a bridge with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of forming an allene, but that would have a different IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which would show two IR peaks, unless they're identical.

Wait, but the IR shows a single peak at 1720, so maybe a single carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the H NMR would show different shifts. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the NMR.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a set of two protons, perhaps on an oxygen. Maybe an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests some equivalent protons attached to carbons in a rigid structure, like in adamantane. And 1.94 (2H) might be another set, perhaps adjacent to the oxygen.

So putting this together, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then, the IR would have an epoxide peak. Alternatively, a diepoxide.

Wait, but if it's an epoxide, the protons adjacent to the oxygen would be around 3-4 ppm. The 4.79 ppm could be for the epoxide protons. But then, why is the IR at 1720?

Wait, maybe it's not an epoxide but something else. Let's think: if product 1 is an ester. The 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, which matches an ester. Then, the NMR would have an OCH2 group, which would be around 4 ppm, which matches the 4.79 ppm.

So product 1 could be an ester. But wait, how?

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and heating with KOH. Maybe it's a substitution to form a diol, but then perhaps an oxidation occurs. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the -O- groups are formed.

Wait, but how would the diol form an ester? Maybe under basic conditions, the diol could undergo some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester and a base. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are replaced by -O- groups, leading to an ether. But then, why the IR at 1720?

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me recap: product 1 has a carbonyl (IR 1720), and its NMR shows an OCH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me think: the 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead protons in adamantane, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another group.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diglycol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination reaction, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is due to some neighboring group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone, such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with a ketone group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the next step.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group—maybe it's an ester. So, heating an ester with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring. So if product 1 is an aromatic ester, then heating with Al isopropoxide would facilitate a Friedel-Crafts reaction. But product 1's structure isn't clear yet.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al isopropoxide is used to open it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: product 1's NMR. The 4.79 (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, and the 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be the bridgehead protons in adamantane. So, perhaps product 1 is an ether, but with a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester of a diol derived from adamantane. So, perhaps the diol reacts with something to form an ester. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ester, a lactone. The IR at 1720 would fit that. Then, the 4.79 would be the ester oxygen's adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a lactone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe via elimination to form a diol, which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. Then, under certain conditions, the diol could cyclize to form a lactone. But in that case, the IR would show a carbonyl, and the NMR would show an ester group.

But wait, the product is formed by heating with KOH. Maybe it's an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, leading to a ring formation and the loss of water. So, the diol would lose water to form a lactone.

So, product 1 would be a cyclic ester (lactone) derived from the diol.

Then, product 1's NMR would have the ester's CH2O group at around 4.79 ppm (2H), the bridgehead protons at 2.41-2.23 (10H), and another set of protons at 1.94 (2H), perhaps from the ring.

That seems plausible.

So, product 1 is a lactone—specifically, an adamantane-based lactone. So the structure would be a bridged ring with an ester group.

Now, moving on to product 2. It's formed by heating product 1 (the lactone) with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What does Al isopropoxide do in such a reaction?

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and is often used in the Friedel-Crafts acylation. However, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring. If product 1 is a lactone with a ketone group (but wait, product 1 is an ester, not a ketone), perhaps Al isopropoxide is used to catalyze some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a lactone, perhaps the Lewis acid would help in opening the lactone ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in a Claisen condensation or some kind of ester condensation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester and Al isopropoxide is used to facilitate a nucleophilic attack, perhaps leading to a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes an elimination reaction, forming a more unsaturated structure.

Hmm, I'm not quite sure about this step. Let me think about the next reaction.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. When ozone is bubbled through a solution at low temperature (like -78°C), it reacts with alkenes to form ozonides, which upon workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) break down into carbonyl compounds.

So, product 2 must contain a double bond. Ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 2 has at least one double bond.

Wait, so product 2 is the product after heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. So, perhaps product 2 is a diene or an alkene.

Putting it all together: product 1 is a lactone (ester), product 2 is an alkene, which upon ozonolysis gives product 3 as two carbonyl compounds.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR of product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis of a diene, each fragment becomes a carbonyl group. So, if the alkene (product 2) was in a symmetric position, product 3 might have two identical carbonyl compounds. But if it's asymmetric, two different ones.

But in this case, perhaps product 2 has a single double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups in product 3.

Wait, but how would product 2 form from product 1 with Al isopropoxide? If product 1 is a lactone, perhaps the Lewis acid catalyzes the opening of the lactone to form an acylium ion, which then undergoes some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide helps in eliminating the ester group to form an alkene.

Wait, elimination of the ester? How?

Wait, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R'. To eliminate, perhaps it could form a ketone if the adjacent hydrogen is abstracted. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the ester undergoes a Claisen condensation, but that requires another ester or ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene formed by the elimination of the ester group.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR of product 3.

In product 3, after ozonolysis, each carbonyl group would have adjacent protons. The most deshielded would be the ones attached to carbonyls, so their coupling would depend on their neighboring protons.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H.

In ozonolysis, each carbonyl group would have adjacent protons. If the original alkene was isolated, the resulting carbonyl protons would each have a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, for example, if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds, each with adjacent CH2 groups. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be split based on neighboring groups.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is a simple alkene like CH2=CH-. Then ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde groups, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more complex structure, say, an allyl group attached to a ring.

Another approach: the coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons. So, if a proton has n neighboring protons, it would be a (n+1) multiplet.

So, a triplet would be if each H is next to a CH2 group (two H's), leading to a triplet. Or if it's a doublet of triplets, that would imply coupling with two different sets of protons.

But without knowing the exact structure, I need to think of the most probable scenario.

Wait, perhaps the alkene (product 2) is in a cyclic structure, leading to a specific coupling pattern after ozonolysis.

Alternatively, if the original alkene is part of a bridged bicyclic structure, the resulting product 3 might have protons that are coupled to two different sets of neighboring Hs.

Wait, considering that ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups, the adjacent Hs would each be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, if each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, then each of those Hs would couple with the Hs on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, let's say the original double bond was between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would split each CH2 into two groups with carbonyls. So each carbonyl would be attached to a CH2. The Hs on those CH2 groups would each be next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled with two neighboring Hs (like in a CH2 group) and possibly another set. So, each H adjacent to the carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs and perhaps another set from another group.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the multiplicity.

If a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, or a triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

So, if a proton is next to a CH2 (two Hs) and also next to another CH2 that's adjacent to another group, then it might couple with two different sets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group.

So, each H in the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the two Hs in their own CH2 and the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. So that would make a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a more complex splitting.

Wait, the splitting would be for each neighboring group. So, if a H is next to a CH2 (two Hs), that would split it into a triplet. If it's also next to another CH2 (another two Hs), that would further split each of the triplet peaks into triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with three neighboring Hs, it would be a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: if the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs from the next CH2, leading to a triplet. Then, if each of those triplets is further split by another set of two Hs, it becomes a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded H (adjacent to the carbonyl) would be part of a CH2 group next to another CH2, which is next to another group. So each H would have coupling with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the correct answer would be option B, triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) analyzed via 1H NMR. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C produces a light yellow solid (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or lactone. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak suggests an -OCH₂- group, consistent with a lactone structure. Thus, product 1 is likely a lactone derived from the diol formed by elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**  
   Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide likely facilitates a reaction involving the lactone. Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, could catalyze the opening of the lactone ring or promote elimination, forming an alkene (product 2). This step introduces a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves alkenes.

3. **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond in product 2, producing product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, and its coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

4. **Analysis of the Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is coupled to two neighboring protons on the same CH₂ group and two additional protons on an adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a splitting pattern of a triplet of triplets.

**Critical Evaluation of Options:**  
- **A) Triplet:** This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled to two equivalent protons (e.g., a CH₂ group). However, the presence of additional coupling constants suggests a more complex pattern.  
- **B) Triplet of Triplets:** This pattern arises when a hydrogen is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons, such as in adjacent CH₂ groups. This matches the expected structure of product 3.  
- **C) Doublet of Triplets:** This would require coupling with one proton and two equivalent protons, which is inconsistent with the expected structure.  
- **D) Pentet:** This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled to four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the reaction sequence.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a coupling pattern of a triplet of triplets. 

**Answer: B**
