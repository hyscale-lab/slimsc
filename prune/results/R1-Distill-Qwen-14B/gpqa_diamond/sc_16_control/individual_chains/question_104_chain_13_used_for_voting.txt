Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question says that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected the planets, and the spectral line shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 2 respectively. We need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, what's the RV method again? Oh right, it's about the Doppler shift. When a star has a planet orbiting it, the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. We can measure the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as it moves towards and away from us. The shift tells us the speed of the star's movement.

The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. But wait, the formula might be K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) Hmm, maybe I should look for the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets are similar to Neptune, maybe I can find a relation between their periods based on the velocity semi-amplitude.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that P² is proportional to a³/(M_star), but since the masses are the same for both stars, the ratio of their periods would depend on the cube of their orbital radii. But how does this relate to the RV method?

Alternatively, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, and the star is like the Sun, which is much bigger), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, M_p is much smaller, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but G is the gravitational constant, but perhaps I can set up a ratio between the two planets since the stars and planets are similar.

Wait, but in the problem, both planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. Let's call them M_p.

And both stars have the same mass, M_star. So, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, simplifying this, the M_p and M_star^(2/3) terms cancel out. So,

K1/K2 = [ P2^(1/3) ] / [ P1^(1/3) ] 

Which is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, the question gives K1 as 5 milliangstroms and K2 as 7. Wait, no, wait. The question says: Planet #1 has a shift of 5 mA, planet #2 has a shift of 7 mA. So K1 is 5 and K2 is 7.

So, K1/K2 =5/7.

Putting it into our earlier equation:

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can cube both sides to solve for P2/P1.

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So (125)/(343) = P2/P1.

Wait, 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343.

So P2 is (125/343) times P1. Let me compute that.

125 divided by 343 is approximately 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which would mean that the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's. So if P2 is 0.36 of P1, then P2 is shorter. So planet 1's period is longer by 1/0.36, which is approximately 2.78 times. But that's not one of the options.

Wait wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. Because I think I might have inverted the ratio.

Wait, the formula is K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So when you cube both sides, (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1.

Wait, (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if planet 2's period is 0.364 times planet 1's, that means planet 2's period is shorter. So the period of planet 2 is 0.364 times that of planet 1, which is about 36% of planet 1's period. So the period of planet 2 is 0.364 times the period of planet 1. So the ratio of P2 to P1 is 0.364. So the period of planet 2 is 0.364 times as long as planet 1's. So planet 2's period is shorter.

But the question is asking, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then the answer is 0.364, which is approximately 0.36. Looking at the options, option A is 0.36.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because the formula K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) comes from K proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, if K1=5, K2=7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

So P2 is (125/343) times P1. 125/343 is about 0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. The question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.364 times, so it's shorter, meaning that planet 2's period is shorter by a factor of ~0.36.

So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is ~0.36, which would be P2/P1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer should be option A.

Another way to think: K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. So if K2 is larger than K1, that means P2 is smaller than P1.

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so higher K means smaller P.

So K1=5, K2=7. So K2 is higher, so P2 is smaller. So P2 is shorter than P1, ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given by the relationship:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets with similar masses orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of their orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

The problem states that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
P_2 = 0.364 \cdot P_1
\]

This result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.36
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1 by a factor of approximately 0.36. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
