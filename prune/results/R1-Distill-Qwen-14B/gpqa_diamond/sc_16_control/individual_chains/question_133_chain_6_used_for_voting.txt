Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So the question is about how to calculate that.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. And the temperatures are 25°C, which probably means standard conditions for calculating Ka values.

Wait, the K_a values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the relevant one here is probably Ka2 because we're dealing with HPO4^2- maybe? Or maybe not, wait. Let me think about the salts.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its dissociation in water should be: KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^- . So the H2PO4^- ion is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (dihydrate). Its formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O. So HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

So, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the K_a values: Ka1 is for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-. Ka2 is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-. Ka3 is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

So in solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be in equilibrium, influenced by Ka2. So maybe the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But I'm trying to find the concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-). But how much of that will be present?

Wait, the main species in solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the solution is made with these salts. So perhaps we can set up an equilibrium where HPO4^2- dissociates to form PO4^3- and H+.

But wait, what's the pH of the solution? Because the presence of these ions affects the pH, but I don't know the pH yet. Maybe I can calculate it using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

Let's calculate that.

The solution has 200 cm³, so 0.2 liters.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

So, since KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-, the moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007337 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, molecular weight 177.99. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-, so moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036685 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M

So, using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.036685)

Calculating the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.7657

Log(0.7657) is approx log(0.766) ≈ -0.113.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.113 ≈ 7.094.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the ratio correctly.

Wait, 0.028065 / 0.036685 → let me compute it more accurately.

0.028065 ÷ 0.036685 ≈ 0.7657.

Log(0.7657) is approximately... I think log(0.75) is about -0.1249, log(0.8)= -0.09691. So 0.7657 is between those.

Using exact calculation: 10^(-0.113) ≈ 0.7657. So yes, log(0.7657)=−0.113.

So pH is about 7.094.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The pKa2 is about 7.21, and the pH is 7.09, which is below pKa2. That would mean that the acid (H2PO4^-) is more predominant than the base (HPO4^2-). But in our solution, the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = ~0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] ~ 0.02806 M. So the ratio [HPO4]/[H2PO4] is about 0.7657, which is <1, so log is negative, hence pH is lower than pKa2.

So the pH is 7.09.

Now, to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The K for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

But wait, the pH is 7.09. So [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.238e-8 M.

So the Ka3 expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, [H+] = 8.238e-8.

Plugging in:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.238e-8)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.238e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.238e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.238) * 1e-6.

5.0517 / 8.238 ≈ 0.613.

So 0.613e-6 = 6.13e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, right?

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.238e-8.

Wait, 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.817 ≈ 8.17e-8. So about 8.2e-8.

So calculation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.2e-8.

Compute numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) * 1e-12.

1.8 * 0.028065 ≈ 0.050517 → 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by denominator 8.2e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.2e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.2) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.2 ≈ 0.616.

So 0.616e-6 = 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. So perhaps that's the answer. But why isn't it exactly matching? Maybe due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let's compute [H+] precisely.

pH =7.094 → [H+] = 10^(-7.094) = ?

Compute 10^(-0.094) = 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but 0.094 is slightly less than 0.1, so 0.794 * 1e-7 → 7.94e-8. Wait, no, wait: 10^(-7.094) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.094) → 1e-7 * approx 0.817 = 8.17e-8.

So, [H+] = 8.17e-8.

Now compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065.

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517 → 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by [H+] =8.17e-8 → 5.0517e-14 /8.17e-8 = (5.0517 /8.17 ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.17 ≈ 0.618 → 0.618e-6 =6.18e-7 M.

Hmm, but the option A is 6.24e-7. Close enough? Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: maybe the total concentration of PO4 species is fixed, but I'm considering the dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the buffer solution and the concentration based on the pH.

Wait, another thought: orthophosphate is formed from HPO4^2- via the third dissociation, which is quite weak. But I used Ka3, which is correct.

Wait, but what about the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Because both are present, so that would make sense. So the pH is determined by the Henderson equation, which we used.

Then, using that pH, we calculate [PO4^3-] from the HPO4^2- dissociation.

So the calculation seems correct, giving around 6.18e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B) 5.48e-7

C) 2.81e-7

D) 3.97e-7.

So option A is the closest to what I calculated, 6.18e-7. But wait, perhaps I made an error in the exact [H+] calculation.

Wait, let me compute pH more accurately. pH was 7.094. Let's calculate 10^-7.094:

Using a calculator, 10^(-7.094) = antilog(-7.094) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.094).

Compute 10^(-0.094):

It's the same as 1/(10^0.094).

Compute 10^0.094:

We know 10^0.1 ≈1.2589. 0.094 is 0.1-0.006.

Approximating:

At x=0.1, 10^x=1.2589.

The derivative of 10^x is ln(10)*10^x ≈2.3026 *1.2589≈2.890.

So, the change for x=0.006 (dx= -0.006), so 10^(0.094) =10^(0.1 -0.006)=10^0.1 *10^(-0.006).

10^(-0.006) ≈1 - 0.006 * ln(10) ≈1 -0.006 *2.3026≈1-0.0138≈0.9862.

So 10^0.094≈1.2589 * 0.9862 ≈1.243.

So 10^(-0.094)=1/1.243 ≈0.8046.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8046 ≈8.046e-8 M.

So now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.046e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028065 =5.0517e-14.

Denominator:8.046e-8.

5.0517e-14 /8.046e-8 = (5.0517 /8.046) *1e-6.

5.0517 /8.046≈0.6279.

So 0.6279e-6 =6.279e-7 M.

That's about 6.28e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's very close. So probably option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm assuming that the only source of PO4^3- is the dissociation of HPO4^2- in solution. Is that correct? Or is there another source?

KH2PO4 is H2PO4^-, which can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (if there's a base), but in this case, the presence of HPO4^2- from the other salt.

Wait, but when you have a solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but that would require a base, which comes from the solution. But in this case, the solution is a buffer, so the pH is determined by the ratio of the two concentrations.

But regarding PO4^3-, it's only coming from HPO4^2- losing another proton, which is a very weak process (Ka3 is 1.8e-12). So that's the main source.

So, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.

So, the answer would be approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the initial calculations.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007337 mol → [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005613 mol → [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → let me compute that correctly.

Ka is 6.2e-8, so pKa is -log(6.2e-8).

Log(6.2)=0.7924; log(1e-8)= -8. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH =7.2076 + log(0.028065/0.036685) → 7.2076 + log(0.7657) → log(0.7657)= -0.113 → pH=7.0946.

Then, [H+] =10^(-7.0946)= 8.04e-8.

Then [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) /8.04e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028065 =5.0517e-14.

Denominator:8.04e-8 →5.0517e-14 /8.04e-8 =6.283e-7.

So approximately 6.28e-7 M.

Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, with molecular weights of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely, \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007337 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.036685 \, \text{M}\).

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely, \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.028065 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which are conjugate acid-base pairs with \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} \right)
\]  
- \( \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \)  
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.036685} \approx 0.7657
  \]  
- \( \log(0.7657) \approx -0.113 \)  
- \( \text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.113 = 7.094 \).

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
The dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻ is governed by:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]  
- \( [H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.046 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \)  
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.046 \times 10^{-8}}
  \]  
  \[
  [PO₄³⁻] \approx \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.046 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \].

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

Answer: A
