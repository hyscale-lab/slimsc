Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X of 8 GeV, the mass m_X of 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X of 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so I think I need to calculate something related to how far the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But first, I need to figure out the lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the width of the resonance to the lifetime. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. So Γ is the total decay width, and the uncertainty in energy is Γ. So the lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). Or wait, is it τ ≈ ħ/(Γ)? I think so because Γ is the total decay rate, and Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ).

Wait, actually, from what I recall, the natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle: Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. For that, I can use the energy and mass to find the velocity. The production energy E_X is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy.

Wait, but E_X is the total energy, right? So E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). Let me compute gamma first.

But wait, the units here are in GeV, so I should probably convert them into appropriate SI units, but maybe I can find the velocity without getting into that mess. Alternatively, I can work with natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then I'd have to convert back to meters at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic relation for the decay length. I think the formula for the mean decay length is L = c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Compute the velocity β (v/c) of the meson.
3. Compute the Lorentz factor γ = E/(m c²). Since E is given as 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, gamma would be (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but wait. E is the total energy, right? So E = γ m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV, the c² units would cancel, making gamma dimensionless. So gamma would indeed be 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So that makes sense. So gamma is 6.6667.

Now, β is v/c. To find beta, I can compute sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So let's compute that.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).
gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 is (1/44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me think about the units.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. So I need to convert Γ into energy units, then ħ is in J·s, so τ will be in seconds.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute using natural units first and then convert to meters.

Wait, natural units: c=1, ħ=1. So in natural units, time is measured in inverse energy. So τ would be 1 / Γ.

But Γ is in MeV, so I need to convert it into GeV.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ in natural units is 1/ (0.32 GeV) = (1 GeV^-1 ) / 0.32.

But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The Heisenberg uncertainty says Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But in natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, perhaps.

Wait, let me get the value of ħ in GeV·s.

I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (Γ in GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is in MeV, so I need to convert it to GeV.

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875.

So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay length is L = v * τ.

v is beta * c. Beta is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 * c.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but I think I should use more precise numbers, but maybe I can proceed with approximations.

So L ≈ v * τ = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ).

Let me compute that:

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me calculate 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625. But since it's 2.966, which is 3 * 0.9887, I think I can compute 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see:

2.056875 * 2.966.

Hmm, 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375; 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.0 (approx).

Wait, maybe I should compute it accurately.

2.966 * 2.056875.

Break it down:

2.966 * 2 =5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483; 2.966 * 0.006875≈ ≈0.02042. So total ≈ 0.1483 +0.02042=0.1687.

So total is 5.932 + 0.1687 ≈6.1007.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting approximately 6.1e-16 meters. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest options are A and D, which are about 5e-16 and 4e-16. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute these more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact formula for L, which is L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.

Wait, because L = v * tau, and v = beta c. So L = beta c tau.

But tau is ħ/(Gamma), so L = beta c (ħ / Gamma).

But also, since gamma is E/(m c²), perhaps another approach is possible.

Wait, maybe I can compute beta gamma. Because beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma. Since gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667, and beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887. So beta gamma ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.6. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

Compute beta: sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.44444)) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta * gamma ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Compute 6.6666667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591.

So sum is 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈6.5913.

Now, L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, but tau is ħ/(Gamma), so L = c * (ħ/(Gamma)) * beta gamma.

But ħ is in J·s, so we need to make sure the units are compatible.

Alternatively, using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then converting back to meters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in GeV and then convert the units.

L = (c * ħ) * (beta gamma) / (Gamma) )

But I think I can use the formula:

L = (c * ħ) * (beta gamma) / (Gamma)

Where c is in m/s, ħ in J·s, beta gamma is dimensionless, and Gamma in GeV.

But let me compute:

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) * (6.5913) / (0.32 GeV)

Wait, the GeV units will cancel because Gamma is in GeV. Let's compute:

First, 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16 m·GeV·s/s.

Wait, but when I divide by Gamma (0.32 GeV), the GeV cancels, and I multiply by beta gamma.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) * (6.5913) / (0.32 GeV)

The GeV cancels, and s in numerator and denominator also cancels. So:

L = (3e8) * (6.582e-25) * (6.5913) / 0.32 ) m.

Compute the numerical part:

(3e8) * (6.582e-25) = 1.9746e-16.

Multiply by 6.5913: 1.9746e-16 * 6.5913 ≈ approx 1.9746 *6.5913 = let's compute that.

1.9746 * 6 =11.8476.

1.9746 * 0.5913 ≈ approx 1.9746 *0.5 is 0.9873; 1.9746 *0.0913≈~0.1797. So total for 0.5913 is ~1.167.

So total is about 11.8476 +1.167=13.0146.

So 13.0146e-16.

Now divide by 0.32:

13.0146e-16 / 0.32 ≈ (13.0146 / 0.32) e-16.

13.0146 / 0.32 is approx 40.669.

So L ≈40.669e-16 m =4.0669e-15 m.

Wait, wait, that's 4.0669e-15 meters, which is about 4.07e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Oh, so my calculation is close to option B, which is about 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps using the exact gamma and beta would be better.

Let me recompute beta and gamma more accurately.

gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So 1/gamma² = 1/(44.444444444) ≈0.0225.

1 -0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but more accurately, let's compute sqrt(0.9775):

0.9887^2 = approx 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.98872.

Then beta*gamma = 6.666666667 * 0.98872 ≈ let's calculate this precisely.

6 * 0.98872 =5.93232.

0.666666667 * 0.98872 = approx 0.666666667 *0.98872 = 0.659146667.

So sum is 5.93232 + 0.659146667 =6.59146667.

Now, let's redo the calculation for L.

L = (c * ħ * beta gamma ) / (Gamma )

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

beta gamma=6.59146667.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) * 6.59146667 / 0.32 GeV.

The GeV cancels, and s cancels.

So,

L = (3e8) * (6.582e-25) * (6.59146667) / 0.32 ) meters.

Compute the constants:

First, 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 3 *6.582 =19.746; exponents 1e8 *1e-25 =1e-17.

So 19.746e-17.

Now multiply by 6.59146667: 19.746e-17 *6.59146667 ≈ 19.746 *6.59146667 ≈ let's compute that.

19.746 *6 =118.476.

19.746 *0.59146667 ≈ 19.746 *0.5 is 9.873, 19.746 *0.09146667≈ ~1.804. Total ≈ 9.873 +1.804 =11.677.

So total is 118.476 +11.677=130.153.

So 130.153e-17.

Now, divide by 0.32: 130.153e-17 / 0.32 = (130.153 /0.32) e-17.

130.153 /0.32= approx 406.728.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 130.153 is 130.153e-17, which is 1.30153e-15. Oh wait, no, wait a second.

Wait, 3e8 *6.582e-25 =1.9746e-16 (since 3e8 is 3*1e8, 6.582e-25 is 6.582*1e-25. 3*6.582=19.746, 1e8 *1e-25=1e-17. So 19.746e-17 =1.9746e-16.

Then multiply by 6.59146667: 1.9746e-16 *6.59146667 ≈ (1.9746 *6.59146667)e-16.

1.9746 *6.59146667 ≈ let's compute:

1.9746 *6 =11.8476.

1.9746 *0.59146667 ≈ ~1.169.

Total ≈11.8476 +1.169=13.0166.

So now, 13.0166e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 13.0166e-16 /0.32 = (13.0166 /0.32) e-16.

13.0166 /0.32 =40.676875.

So L=40.676875e-16 m =4.0676875e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma
\]

where:
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the lifetime of the particle,
- \( \beta \gamma = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \cdot \gamma \) is the product of the velocity factor \( \beta \) and the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \),
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667 \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
Using \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma \), we get:

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) \cdot 6.5913.
\]

First, compute \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = (6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \cdot 6.5913 \approx 4.0676875 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.0677 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
