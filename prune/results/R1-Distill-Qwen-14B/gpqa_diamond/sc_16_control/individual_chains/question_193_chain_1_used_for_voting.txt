Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance. Or wait, more accurately, the distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So distance r = 1 / plx.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since r is the distance, and r = 1/plx, I can substitute that in. So 1/plx is r, so N is proportional to r^5. Wait, that's one way to look at it.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think it's asking about the number density or the rate of stars per unit distance. So maybe it's about the differential number of stars with respect to distance.

Let me think in terms of differentials. If N is proportional to r^5, then to find how the number changes with r (like dN/dr), I need to take the derivative of N with respect to r. But wait, wait. Let me clarify: the number of stars in a region as a function of distance—since parallax relates to distance, perhaps the way N depends on r is through a differential.

Wait, no, the initial statement is that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx decreases, N increases. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, as r increases, plx decreases.

But the problem says number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ r^5 (since plx =1/r). So N is proportional to r^5.

But the question asks how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit volume or per unit distance shell. Wait, no, the question is about the number in that region varying with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, N increases as r^5.

Wait, but the options given are about the dependence, so the answer would be proportional to r^5, which is option B. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, perhaps I need to think of it in terms of the differential. If N is the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, then the number of stars per unit volume in that shell would depend on the area of the shell and the thickness. Wait, maybe I should model it more accurately.

Wait, parallax relates to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is plx = 1 / r (where r is in parsecs). So if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then substituting plx = 1/r, we get N ∝ r^5.

But wait, the number of stars in a region isn't just a function of r, but perhaps how they are distributed. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for a given shell between r and r+dr, the number of stars would be dN = N(r) * 4πr² dr, because the volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr. Wait, no. Wait, no, if the number of stars per unit volume is n(r), then the number in a shell is n(r) * 4πr² dr. But perhaps in this case, the N is given as varying with 1/plx^5, which is r^5.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5 → N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But the question is about the change with distance. So per unit distance, how does the number change?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the differential. Suppose N is the number of stars within a certain distance r. Then dN/dr would be the number of stars per unit distance. But earlier, I thought N is proportional to r^5, so dN/dr would be 5r^4. So the change in number per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. That would be option C.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, N = k * r^5. So N = k r^5.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So per unit distance, perhaps it's the rate of change of N with r. So dN/dr would be the number of stars per unit distance. So dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4, which would be option C.

But wait, another thought: maybe the number of stars in a region is a function of the volume. Because the number of stars you can see depends on the volume of the region you're observing. But in this case, the problem states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the region is a volume, and the way N varies is with parallax, which ties into the distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation as follows. The number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, but with some other factors. But the problem might not be directly about volume. Let's think: the number of stars in a region as a function of parallax is given. So the number is N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, 1/plx is distance. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5 → r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But when we talk about the number of stars per unit distance, perhaps we're considering a differential. Like, how many more stars are there between r and r + dr compared to r - dr and r.

In that case, if N(r) = k r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be dN = 5k r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) would be 5k r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question states "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's the rate of change, which is dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

So looking back at the options, option C is ~ r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), we can substitute \( \text{plx} \) into the equation to express \( N \) in terms of \( r \):  
\[
N \propto r^5
\]  
This shows that the number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).  

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), i.e., \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:  
\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]  
Thus, the number of stars changes with distance per unit range as \( r^4 \).  

From the given options, the correct answer is:  
**C) ~ r^4**
