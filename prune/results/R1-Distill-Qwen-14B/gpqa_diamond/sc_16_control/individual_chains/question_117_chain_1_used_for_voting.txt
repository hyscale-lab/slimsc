Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds can exhibit this property. Let me think about what I remember about optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning there's a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it can also occur due to other factors like axial chirality in certain structures, but I think for this question, it's mainly about chiral centers.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to check each one for the possibility of having chiral centers or other sources of optical activity.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl compounds can sometimes have axial chirality. Biphenyls can have a single bond between the two phenyl rings, which allows rotation. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates non-superimposable mirror images, then they can exhibit optical isomerism. 

In this compound, there are nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and carboxylate ester groups at positions 2 and 2'. Since the substituents are on opposite sides of the biphenyl, this might create a situation where the two halves are mirror images. But wait, does that mean it's possible for this structure to have axial chirality?

Yes, biphenyls with two different substituents on each ring in the 1,1' position can exhibit enantiomerism. So this compound could have optical isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure here is like CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let's see the carbon chain. The central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to: CH3, COOCH3, and two other groups. Wait, wait. Let me draw it.

The formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CO-O-CH2-OH? No, wait, not exactly. Wait, the structure is probably (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH) something... No, wait. Maybe it's CH3-C(OH)-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the name. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, but as an ester, it's methyl ester, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: 

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

But the 2-hydroxy would mean the OH is on the second carbon. So the structure is: 

CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (second carbon) is connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, a CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait no. Wait, let me write it properly.

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the structure HOCH2CH2COOH. Then, the ester is made by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's 3-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps? Because 2-hydroxy would be on the adjacent carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The propanoate ester is methyl (CH3) group attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the carbon with the OH group. That carbon is connected to:

- One CH2 group (from the next carbon, which is attached to COOCH3),
- One OH,
- One CH2 group (the other side),
- And perhaps another group attached.

Wait, wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2COOCH3? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but the key is whether there's a chiral center.

If the carbon with the OH is attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. Let's imagine the structure: maybe the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- A methyl group (from CH3),
- A hydroxyl group (OH),
- A carbonyl group (from the COOCH3),
- And another CH2 group leading to the next carbon.

Wait, maybe not, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Ah, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups (the other side is CH2COOCH3 and the same side is CH2... no, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)CH3. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think differently. The molecule's formula would be C4H7O4 (since propanoate is C3H5O3, but as an ester, maybe different). Anyway, regardless of the structure, if the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is (2R)- or (2S)- configuration. So yes, that carbon is attached to:

- A methyl group (from the COOCH3),
- A hydroxyl group,
- A carbonyl group (O from the ester),
- And another CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps the groups are: (CH3)COO- methyl ester is on the end. So the structure might be:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this, the carbon with the OH is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups (the same as the next carbon and the previous one),
- OH,
- COOCH3.

Wait, but if the central carbon is CH2, then it's not a chiral center. Because for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents.

So if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon is CH2, so it's CH2-OH, CH2 in the middle. That carbon is attached to two CH2 groups (same on both sides), and two other groups: OH and COOCH3. So it's attached to two identical groups, so it can't be a chiral center. Thus, this compound wouldn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps I got the structure wrong. Another possibility is that the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon with OH is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group (but wait, that would be CH2? Or CH connected to what?)

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (maybe that's not right). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which has the OH on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain.

In that case, the carbon with OH is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups (from the left and right),
- OH,
- and a carbonyl group (COOCH3).

So the groups are: CH2CH3 (from the left?), COOCH3 (from the right), OH, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's:

The carbon chain is:

COOCH3 is on the first carbon, then CH(OH) on the second, then CH3 on the third.

Wait, that would make it CH2CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should move on and come back.

3. Benzophenone.

Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. So the carbonyl is in the center, connected to two benzene rings. Since the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, it's not a chiral center. Also, the molecule is symmetric, so any possible stereoisomerism is unlikely.

Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. So this compound isn't an optical isomer.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form, so dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)- configured. Let me think about the structure.

Fumarate is the trans-dihydroxy form. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the trans configuration (E). So when it's esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-CH2COOCH3 attached to each end.

Wait, no. The structure is O

           O
           ||
CH2-C-O-C-OCH3
           ||
           O
           O

No, perhaps I should think of it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 ?

No, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When converted to dimethyl ester, it becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Wait, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

CH2=CH is part of the chain. So the actual structure is (E)-CH2COOCH3 connected by a double bond to another CH2COOCH3?

Wait, no, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate:

It's MeOOC-CH2CH2-COOme but with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it (E)- or (Z)-.

Wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. No, wait, fumarate is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, with the double bond in the trans configuration.

In this structure, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, can this compound exhibit optical isomerism?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on either side. The substituents are the two methyl esters. So the groups on each end are the same (methyl ester groups), so there's no possibility of enantiomers because the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no. Wait, let me think.

Wait, when the groups on each end are the same, the molecule could still have geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents on the double bond are the same, then the molecule can't have enantiomers. Because for a double bond to produce optical isomers, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond must be different and arranged in a way that creates non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon is attached to:

- One ester group (OCH3),
- And one CH2 group (but wait, no, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each attached to two COOme groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between the second and third carbons. Each of those carbons is attached to two carboxylic acid groups (but in the ester form, two OMe groups).

So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Now, looking at each of the double bond carbons. Each is attached to:

- One OMe group,
- One CH2 group (but wait, no, each is attached to two OMe groups and a double bond? No, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to two groups: one OMe and another group.

Wait, no. Each double bond carbon is connected to two OMe groups and the two adjacent carbons. Wait, but in the structure, each double bond carbon is connected to one OMe group and one CH group.

Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to two substituents: one MeOOC group and another CH2. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, each double bond carbon is connected to two substituents: one OMe and one carbonyl group (from the other ester).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should think about whether the structure has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it can't be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate (E), the substituents on each double bond are arranged trans. Each of the two carbons in the double bond has the same groups attached (each is attached to a MeOOC group and a CH group). So, no, because each substituent is the same on both sides, but wait, no, each substituent is OMe on one side and OMe on the other. So the molecule is symmetrical.

But wait, in the E configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to it being chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each double bond are identical, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, in dimethyl maleate, the substituents are the same on each side, so it's symmetrical and thus not chiral. But fumarate is the trans isomer, but the substituents are the same on each end.

So in dimethyl fumarate, each end is OMe, so when you have the E configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides. But since they're same on both ends, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate can't exhibit optical isomerism because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I'm wrong. Because if the substituents on each end are the same, then in the E configuration, the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Because if you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks the same. So in that case, there's no optical isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus cannot have enantiomers. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: what about cyclohexane derivatives with two identical substituents on opposite sides? Those are meso compounds, so they're achiral. So in this case, dimethyl fumarate would have two identical ester groups on each end, leading to a meso form. So, no optical isomerism.

Now, going back to the options:

1. The biphenyl compound: has axial chirality, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I'm not sure about the structure, but if it has a chiral center, then it will have optical isomerism. Wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought the central carbon might have four different groups.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- methyl ester. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH2 group (left side, connected to another CH2),
- OH,
- COOCH3 group (right side),
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the second carbon (the one with OH): it's connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right),
- OH,
- and the central CH2 group (connecting to COOCH3).

Wait, no. The second carbon has:

- Left: CH2(OH)
- Right: CH2COOCH3
- And two more substituents? Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So the second carbon is attached to:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's?

Wait, that's not possible because each carbon must have four bonds. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The second carbon is CH2, but that would have two CH2 groups adjacent. Wait, perhaps the second carbon is actually attached to:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- One OH,
- One CH2 group (from the third carbon),
- And another group.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

In that case, the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group leading to the next carbon.

Wait, no, that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another H.

Wait, that's four different groups? CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

So if the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H, then yes, this is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the structure might not have a chiral center. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let's clarify: for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen? Or another CH2 group?

Wait, no, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) has:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group connected to the next carbon.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think of propanoate as:

The molecule is (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that would be four carbons, but propanoate is three. So maybe it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. That makes sense because propanoate is three carbons. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another H.

Wait, that can't be, because each carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CO-OCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another H.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is CH(OH), but the groups would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would have optical isomerism.

So, back to the options:

1. Yes, optical isomerism (axial chirality).

2. Yes, because of a chiral center.

3. No, benzophenone is symmetric and has no chiral centers.

4. No, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4.

Option D) 1 and 2.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought about option 4, which is dimethyl fumarate. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to:

- OMe group,
- and another OMe group on the other end.

Wait, but each carbon is connected to two OMe groups and two CH groups. So the substituents are the same on each end, making the molecule symmetric. So it can't be chiral. So no optical isomerism.

So the correct answer is option D: 1 and 2.

Wait, but in the options, option A is 1,2,4.

But according to my analysis, 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, while 4 does not.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: if the substituents on the double bond are different, then the molecule could have optical isomerism. But in dimethyl fumarate, both substituents on each end are the same (methyl esters), making the molecule symmetric. So no optical isomerism.

So the correct compounds are 1 and 2, which correspond to option D.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, the first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

This structure has a biphenyl group with substituents at positions 2 and 2', and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the substituents are arranged in such a way that the biphenyl can have axial chirality.

In biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that allow the molecule to have a non-superimposable mirror image, then it can exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if each ring has a substituent in the ortho position relative to the connecting bond, then the molecule can have axial chirality.

So in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and nitro at 6 and 6'. Wait, is that correct? So each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6 positions. But wait, the positions on the biphenyl are a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, but the arrangement could lead to axial chirality. So yes, this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. Yes.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So the correct answer is option D: 1 and 2.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says 1 and 2, which are options 1 and 2 in the question.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which can arise from chiral centers or axial chirality.

### 1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
This compound is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions. Biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substituents at positions 2 and 2' (carboxylate groups) and 6 and 6' (nitro groups) create a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

### 2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carbonyl ester group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen atom. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

### 3. Benzophenone
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetric, and the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, making it planar and unable to be a chiral center. Additionally, the symmetry of the molecule precludes the possibility of optical isomerism.

### 4. Dimethyl Fumarate
Dimethyl fumarate is the ester form of fumaric acid, with the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond between the two central carbons is in the trans (E) configuration. However, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical (methyl ester groups), making the molecule symmetric. This symmetry prevents the formation of enantiomers, and thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality and a chiral center, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to their symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
