Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their probabilities of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit (since it's determined by Kepler's laws). 

Also, both planets have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity might complicate things, but here it's the same for both. The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius. Interesting. So, how does that affect the transit probability?

I think the transit probability P depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)) ), but wait, since e=0 here, it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt( (a² + R_s²) )) )? Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's size to the star's, and the orbital distance's effect on the chance the alignment occurs.

Wait, another thought: The probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)). Or wait, perhaps it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, maybe the formula is P = ( (R_p + R_s) / (a) )^2 * (something else). No, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. This probability is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that for a star with radius R, and planet at distance a, the probability is (R / a)^2. Wait, no, because the planet's orbital plane must be within a certain angle relative to us. 

Wait, maybe the probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2. Because the area where the planet can transit is a circle with diameter R_* (the star's size), and the planet's orbital path is a circle of radius a. So the probability is the ratio of the areas, but wait, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So the probability is (2 R_*) / (2 a) ) = R_* / a. Wait, but that's not squared. But wait, no, the chance is the probability that the planet's orbital inclination is such that it crosses our line of sight. So I think the transit probability is (R_* / a), but I've also heard it's (R_* / a)^2. Now I'm getting confused.

Wait, I found a resource before. The probability of a transit is given by (R_*/a)² multiplied by something else? Or actually, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere of possible orbital inclinations. Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the probability might be approximated as (R_*/a)². Or wait, I think for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's roughly R_* / a.

Wait, but another possibility: The probability of transit is proportional to (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability for a circular orbit is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by (1 + (R_p/R_*)^2 )^(1/2), but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on how likely the inclination is such that the planet transits. For a random distribution, the probability is roughly (R_*/a), because only when the inclination is such that the planet's path is within R_* from our line of sight. Wait, no, that's the area. Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_*/a)^2. Because it's the area of the star (π R_*²) over the area of the possible impact parameter (which is π a²).

Ah, impact parameter. The impact parameter is the distance of closest approach on the sky, which for a planet with orbital radius a and star radius R, the maximum impact parameter is a (1 - (R/a)^2 )^0.5, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, the area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_* around the center of the star. The area of that circle is π R_*². The area of the possible positions (parameter space) is π a². So the probability is (R_* / a)^2, assuming a much larger a than R_*. That makes sense.

So P ≈ (R_* / a)^2.

Wait, but I've also read that the transit probability is (R_* / (a))² multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (R_* / a)^2 )) ) or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_* / a)² multiplied by a factor that accounts for the planet's size, but since both planets have the same mass, and probably similar radii (but the question doesn't specify), maybe it's just (R_* / a)^2.

Wait, but the question says that both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have the same radius. Oh, wait, the host stars have the same radii. So R_s is the same for both.

So, for each planet, P is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius).

So, the question is, which planet has a higher (R_s / a)^2 ratio.

Now, R_s is the same for both stars. So the key is to find a for each planet.

Planet_1 has an orbital period 3 times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Using Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (M_* + M_p) ) = (G P^2 )/(4 π² )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So, a^3 = (G P^2 M_*)/(4 π² )

So a is proportional to (P^2 M_*)^0.5.

So, a ∝ sqrt( P^2 M_* ) = P * sqrt( M_* )

So, a_1 = a (P_1, M_*1 ) = ( (P_2/3)^2 * M_*1 )^0.5 * factor.

Wait, let's define:

For Planet_1:

Period P1 = P2 / 3.

Star mass M1 = 2 * M2.

So,

a1 = [ (P1^2 * M1) ]^(1/3) * (4 π² / G )^(-1/3)

Similarly,

a2 = [ (P2^2 * M2) ]^(1/3) * ... 

So,

a1/a2 = [ ( ( (P2/3)^2 * 2 M2 ) / ( P2^2 * M2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ ( ( (P2^2 / 9) * 2 M2 ) ) / (P2^2 M2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Wait, because (a1/a2) = (2/(9))^(1/3) ≈ 0.606. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star, so it's closer.

Now, since a1 is smaller than a2, R_s is same for both.

So, transit probability P ∝ (R_s / a )^2.

So P1 ∝ (R_s / a1 )^2 = (1/(0.606 a2 ))^2 = (1/0.606)^2 * (1/a2)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 * (1/a2^2 )

Similarly, P2 ∝ (R_s / a2 )^2.

So P1 = (1.65^2) * P2.

Wait, let's compute 1.65^2 is approximately 2.72.

So P1 is approximately 2.72 times P2.

Wait no, wait. Let me re-express.

Let me compute P1/P2.

P1/P2 = (R_s /a1 )^2 / (R_s/a2 )^2 = (a2^2 )/(a1^2 ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a1 = a2 * (2/9)^{1/3}, a2/a1 = (2/9)^{-1/3} = (9/2)^{1/3}.

So, (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3) = ( (9/2)^(1/3) )^2.

Compute 9/2 =4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65, so 1.65 squared is ~2.72.

So P1/P2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the probability of transiting. So Planet_1 has a higher probability. But the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my calculations, Planet_1 has a higher probability, so the researchers should observe Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the reasoning again.

We calculated that a1 is smaller than a2. Since transit probability is (R_s / a )^2, and R_s is same, if a1 is smaller, (R_s/a1) is larger than (R_s/a2), so (R_s/a1)^2 is larger than (R_s/a2)^2. So yes, P1 is larger than P2 by a factor of about 2.7.

So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. That matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a1/a2 calculation.

Let me rederive that.

Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G (M_*) P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a is proportional to [ M_* * P² ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (M1) * (P1)^2 ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ M2 * P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 / 3.

So,

a1 = ( 2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ 2 M2 (P2^2 /9 ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

= ( 2/9 )^(1/3 ) * ( (M2 P2^2 ) / ( M2 P2^2 )) )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Let me compute the exact ratio.

a1 = ( 2 M2 * (P2)^2 / 9 )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 P2^2 /9 ) / ( M2 P2^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 )

Which is approximately 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Now, P ∝ (R_s / a )^2.

So P1/P2 = ( (R_s/a1 )^2 ) / ( (R_s/a2 )^2 ) ) = (a2/a1)^2 = (1/0.606 )^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 = 2.72.

So yes, P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

So the correct option is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the orbital radius of the planet. Both planets have the same stellar radius (\(R_*\)), so the key factor is the ratio \(a_1/a_2\), where \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the orbital radii of Planet_1 and Planet_2, respectively.

### Step 1: Orbital Radius Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital radius \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the host star's mass \(M_*\) as:

\[
a \propto \sqrt[3]{M_* \cdot P^2}
\]

For Planet_1:
- Orbital period \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)
- Host star mass \(M_{*,1} = 2 \cdot M_{*,2}\)

For Planet_2:
- Orbital period \(P_2\)
- Host star mass \(M_{*,2}\)

The ratio of the orbital radii is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{M_{*,1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2}}
\]

Substituting \(M_{*,1} = 2 \cdot M_{*,2}\) and \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2 \cdot M_{*,2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2\).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \(\left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
