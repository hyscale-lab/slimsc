Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I think that means the conditions in each star can be treated as if they're in thermal equilibrium locally.

Wait, when atoms are in an energy level, the probability of them being in a higher energy state depends on the temperature. Oh right, that's the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So, for star_1, the number of excited atoms (n2) is twice that of star_2's (n2'). Wait, no, actually, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited..." So maybe n2 for star_1 is twice n2 for star_2. Or wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the populations. Alternatively, maybe star_1 has a higher population in the excited state than star_2.

Let me clarify. Let's denote for star_1: the number in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. The question states that n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, wait, no. The problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio is (n2_star1) / (n2_star2) = 2. No, wait, perhaps the ratio is (n1/n2) for each star. Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

For each star, the ratio of the excited state (n_upper) to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio is (n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ), and similarly for star_2, it's (n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) ).

But the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, so perhaps (n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2). Because star_1 has twice the excitation. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the same energy level and comparing the two stars. Hmm.

Wait, no, the energy difference ΔE is the same for both, since it's the same transition for iron. So the excitation energy is the same for both stars. So the ratio of the upper to lower states would be governed by their respective temperatures.

So, for star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So maybe (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Wait, but that might not be the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) ) = 2.

Wait, but in reality, the actual excitation depends on the total number of atoms, but perhaps the question is considering the ratio of the excited fraction. So, perhaps the fraction of atoms in the upper state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper) / (n1_upper + n1_lower) ) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_upper + n2_lower). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential in star_1 is such that the upper level is more populated relative to the lower level compared to star_2. So, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to write the ratio of the two ratios. Let's denote for star_1: R1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1), and for star_2: R2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2). The problem states R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting the Boltzmann factors:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

And since R1 = 2 R2, R1/R2 = 2.

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking natural log on both sides,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Let me rearrange this:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait, let me be precise. Let me write the equation again.

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/(T2)) - (1/(T1)) ) ]

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the options don't have ΔE in them. Oh wait, the question gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J, but perhaps that's a red herring because the question is about the form of the equation, not the actual numbers.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would match the structure of the equation I derived, except for the ΔE/(k) factor. Wait, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait a second. The question is about the correct equation for the effective temperatures. The options don't include any terms with ΔE or k. So the given equation should only involve T1 and T2.

Wait, but in our equation, we have:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps the given energy difference is used to find the ratio, but the options are about the structure of the equation relating T1 and T2.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, which is approximately k*T where T is about 1e4 K (since k is about 1.38e-23 J/K). Wait, 1e4 K is typical for a star's surface temperature. So perhaps ΔE ≈ k*T, but that depends on the temperature. Wait, but if T is high, then ΔE ≈ k T.

Wait, let me see. Let's compute 1.38e-23 J divided by Boltzmann's constant (which is also 1.38e-23 J/K), so ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So our equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice as high as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Taking the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} \), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is also \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the structure of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
