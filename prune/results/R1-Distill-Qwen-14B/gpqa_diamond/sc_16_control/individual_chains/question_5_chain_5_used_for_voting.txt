Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So, I think the operator in the direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by their respective directions. So maybe P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, that means its y-component is zero, so n_y =0. So the operator P simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would have θ from 0 to pi/2, I think. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the operator P would be (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

But wait, the question is about finding the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |ψ> such that P|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Hmm, but solving for the eigenvector in an arbitrary direction might be a bit involved. Maybe I should first find the matrix form of the operator P in terms of θ, then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me write down each component's matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P is (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z), since n_y is zero. So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ:

P = (sinθ)( (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] ) + (cosθ)( (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute this matrix:

Each term has a factor of ħ/2, so let's factor that out:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Compute the elements:

The (1,1) element: cosθ * 1 (from P_z)
The (1,2) element: sinθ * 1 (from P_x)
The (2,1) element: sinθ * 1 (from P_x)
The (2,2) element: -cosθ * 1 (from P_z)

So the matrix becomes:

[[ ħ/2 * cosθ,  ħ/2 * sinθ ],
 [ ħ/2 * sinθ, - ħ/2 * cosθ ] ]

So P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait: let me make sure. Matrix elements:

Top row:
First element: from P_z it's (ħ/2)*1 * cosθ, since P_z is diag(1,-1) multiplied by ħ/2. So (1,1) is (ħ/2)(cosθ *1). Similarly, (1,2) is (ħ/2)(sinθ *1). 

Second row:
(2,1): (ħ/2)(sinθ *1)
(2,2): (ħ/2)(-cosθ *1)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, each component is multiplied by n_x and n_z. So for each matrix element, for P_x, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are 1, multiplied by n_x. P_z has (1,1)=1 and (2,2)=-1, multiplied by n_z. So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z * 1, n_x * 1], [n_x * 1, n_z*(-1)] ]

So substituting n_z=cosθ and n_x = sinθ, the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So yes, that's correct.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]  * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to get rid of the 2/ħ factor:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix multiplied by the vector [a; b] equals [a; b].

So, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(M - I λ) =0, but wait, but since we already know the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors directly.

Wait, but the way the problem is set up, the operator P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, because each component P_x, P_y, P_z has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and the operator P as a combination would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 as well because it's a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator S·n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Since this is a similar operator, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, so the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2, so we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

So, the equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, no. Because the equation after multiplying by 2/ħ is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So, [a; b] is an eigenvector of the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, so let me write the equation again.

The matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b ]

Which can be written as:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So, equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a + ( - cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve these for a and b.

Let me rearrange equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) → so sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin^2(theta/2)] ] = cot(theta/2) → so a = cot(theta/2) * b

So a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b → a = [cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)] * b = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) * b; b ].

Let me factor out b: [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But to find the normalized eigenvector, I need to normalize this vector.

Wait, the vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ].

So if I let b = sin(theta/2), then:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

Because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so multiplying by sin(theta/2) gives cos(theta/2).

So the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but I think I might have made a miscalculation here. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, if a = cot(theta/2) * b, then the components are [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ].

Let me choose b to be sin(theta/2). Then a becomes:

cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, this is a vector of length sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) )=1, so it's already normalized.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait, I have to make sure this vector satisfies the original equation.

Let's plug a = cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2) into equation 1:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 ?

cos(theta) a = (1 - a^2 - a^2) ? Wait, perhaps it's better to substitute.

Wait, cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So let's compute equation 1:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a.

Wait, no, equation 1 is cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a.

So, substitute a = cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2):

Left-hand side (LHS) = cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2).

Let me compute this.

cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So, cosθ * cos(theta/2) = [2 cos²(theta/2) -1] * cos(theta/2) = 2 cos^3(theta/2) - cos(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, sinθ * sin(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = 2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, LHS = [2 cos^3(theta/2) - cos(theta/2)] + [2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2)].

Factor cos(theta/2) from both terms:

= cos(theta/2) [ 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 + 2 sin²(theta/2) ]

Hmm, let's compute inside the brackets:

2 cos² + 2 sin^2 -1 = 2 [cos^2 + sin^2] -1 = 2*1 -1 =1.

So, inside the brackets is 1. So, LHS = cos(theta/2) * 1.

So equation 1 becomes: cos(theta/2) = a = cos(theta/2) → which is correct.

Similarly, equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b.

Substituting a and b:

sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

Compute left-hand side (LHS):

Again, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), and cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So, substituting:

LHS = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) - [2 cos²(theta/2) -1] * sin(theta/2).

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - [2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 ] sin(theta/2).

Expanding the second term:

= 2 sin cos² - 2 cos² sin + sin(theta/2)

= [2 sin cos² - 2 sin cos² ] + sin(theta/2)

= 0 + sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2) = RHS.

So, yes, the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] satisfies both equations.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D seems to have some hbar terms and more factors.

Wait, the options given are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but wait—am I missing a normalization factor? Because in my calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is already normalized because cos² + sin² =1.

Wait, so why are options A and D including factors of ħ? Because in the eigenvalue equation, the operator is P, which is dimensionless in terms of matrix elements, except for the factor of ħ/2. Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator P is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So in the operator matrix, each element is (ħ/2) times the given matrix.

Wait, but when we found the eigenvector, we derived it using the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ]], which was after factoring out (ħ/2). So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], regardless of the ħ scaling, because the scaling affects the eigenvalues but not the eigenvectors.

So the eigenvector should be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

But wait, let me check the units. The problem says, "the elements of the normalized eigenvector"—wait, the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, because in quantum mechanics, the components are complex numbers representing probability amplitudes, which are dimensionless.

Wait, but looking at option C, it's just (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which has no factors of ħ. So that's correct.

Looking at option D, it's scaled by sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ, which doesn't match what I found.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle. The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction of $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$  
2. $\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0$

From the first equation, solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we find:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]

Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$ into the eigenvector, we get:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} b
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we set $b = \sin(\theta/2)$, giving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This matches the normalized eigenvector given in option C. The other options either include incorrect factors of $\hbar$ or do not match the derived form of the eigenvector.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** Contains factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.  
- **Option B:** Represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector.  
- **Option C:** Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.  
- **Option D:** Includes incorrect normalization factors involving $\hbar$ and $\sqrt{2/3}$ or $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the solution.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
