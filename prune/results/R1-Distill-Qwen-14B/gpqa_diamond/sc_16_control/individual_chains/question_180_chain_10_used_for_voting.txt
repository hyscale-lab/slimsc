Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. 

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So, I think this is a problem about electric potential energy. Because when charges are arranged in space, they have potential energy due to their positions. Since the system is isolated, we can assume that we're looking for the potential energy of the configuration.

Wait, but each charge is 2e. So the charge per particle is 2 times the elementary charge. Elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, let's think about the setup. There's a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed there. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2m away from the central charge.

But wait, the system is of 13 identical particles. So, the central charge is one of them. So, the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the other 12 is 2e. So, the central charge is 2e, and the others are each 2e as well.

So, the system consists of a central charge, surrounded by 12 others at 2 meters.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the minimum energy. Oh, wait, wait. The potential energy between charges is a function of their arrangement. Since all the other charges are fixed at 2m from P, perhaps the configuration's potential energy can be calculated as the sum of all pairwise interactions.

But how? Let's think about the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate all the pairs.

Wait, but in this case, the central charge is fixed, and the others are fixed at 2m. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge. So the potential energy for each of those interactions is U1 = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). So each of these 12 interactions contributes the same amount of energy.

But wait, there's more. The 12 charges at 2m may also interact with each other. So each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge but what about their distance from each other? The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify how they are arranged relative to each other. Hmm, that's tricky.

Wait, the problem says each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So maybe they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But the exact arrangement isn't specified. However, since the question is about the minimum energy, I think that the configuration for minimum potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible.

Wait, but wait. Electric potential energy is positive when like charges are close because the work done to bring them together is positive. To minimize the total energy, you want to maximize the separation. But in this case, the charges are fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary. So, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is as far as possible from the others, so that their mutual potential energy is minimized (since the potential energy between like charges is positive, so minimizing it would mean making their contributions as negative as possible? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive. It's U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for two positive charges, the potential energy is positive. So to minimize the total energy, we need to arrange them such that the potential energy between each pair is as small as possible, i.e., as negative as possible. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the potential energy is positive because the charges are like. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The potential energy of two like charges is positive. Because when you bring them together, you're doing work against the repulsion, so the potential energy increases. So the more they are separated, the lower the potential energy (i.e., the more negative it is? No, wait. Wait, for positive charges, the potential energy is positive. So, bringing them closer increases the potential energy because you have to do work against their mutual repulsion. So, to minimize the potential energy, you want to arrange them as far apart as possible. So, the minimum energy would be achieved when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible.

But wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So their distance from P is fixed, but their mutual distances can vary. So their mutual distances are determined by their arrangement on the sphere of radius 2m.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So if I have to calculate the potential energy between all pairs, including the central charge and each of the 12 charges, and also each pair among the 12.

So, the total potential energy U_total is the sum of all the U for each pair.

So, first, compute U for the central charge and each of the 12 charges. Then, compute U for each pair among the 12.

But wait, the central charge is fixed. So the potential energy due to it would be for each of the 12 charges, the energy between the central charge (2e) and the charge at 2m (2e each). So that's 12 * U1, where U1 is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m).

Then, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Each pair is located on a sphere of radius 2m. How far apart are they? Well, it depends on the arrangement. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we're supposed to assume that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is as far as possible from each other, but we have to compute the potential energy regardless.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge. Because otherwise, without knowing the mutual distances, we can't compute the potential energy between the 12.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum energy is when the 12 charges are as far as possible from each other, so that their mutual potential energy is as low as possible (i.e., as negative as possible, but wait, no, because each pair is positive because they're like charges, so the potential energy is positive). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive because when you bring them together, you're doing positive work. So, to minimize the total potential energy, you would arrange the charges as far apart as possible, making each pair's potential energy as small as possible (since potential energy is positive, smaller in magnitude means lower).

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps this part of the problem is either not considered, or perhaps the problem actually only considers the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, not their mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem would require more information.

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their distance from P is fixed. But without any constraints on their mutual distances, perhaps we can assume that the mutual distances are such that their potential energy contributions are zero. Or perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, not their mutual interactions.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Because in an isolated system, all pairs contribute to the potential energy. So perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would be the sum of all possible pairs. So I can't ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges.

But without knowing the mutual distances, how can I calculate it? Maybe the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are at a certain value, perhaps 2m as well? No, that doesn't make sense because they are each at 2m from P, but their mutual distance would vary depending on their positions on the sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified and only considers the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, not their interactions. Because that would make the problem solvable without knowing their arrangement.

Looking back at the question, it says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the system's energy is the sum of all pairwise potential energies. So the central charge interacts with each of the 12, so that's 12 interactions. Then, each of the 12 charges interacts with each of the others. So that's C(12,2) = 66 interactions.

But wait, without knowing the mutual distances, how can we calculate those terms? Maybe the problem is only about the central charge and the 12, and the other terms are negligible or zero. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they're all at the same distance from each other, which would be the case if they form a regular icosahedron or something, but I don't think we're given that information.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges. That would make the problem straightforward. Because if the mutual interactions are ignored, perhaps because the problem is simplified or because they're considered to be fixed and thus their mutual potential energy is zero (but that's not correct).

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered, but the problem gives us a way to approximate it. Or perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are 2m as well, which would make each pair at 2m apart. But that's probably not the case because if all 12 are at 2m from P, their mutual distance could be more or less than 2m, depending on their arrangement.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges is considered, but arranged in a way that each is at maximum possible distance from every other, thus minimizing their mutual repulsion and hence the potential energy. But how would that work? If each pair is as far apart as possible, then their potential energy (which is positive) would be as small as possible, since U is inversely proportional to r. So for like charges, greater r leads to lower U (smaller, more negative? Wait, no, for U, when r increases, U decreases because it's positive and inversely proportional to r. So for positive charges, higher r leads to lower U (less positive) but that's not negative, it's just less positive. So the total potential energy would be lower when the charges are farther apart.

But without knowing the exact mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this part. Because otherwise, the problem is unsolvable as given.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is intended to have only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not considering their mutual interactions. Because that would make the problem solvable. So I'll proceed under that assumption unless I'm convinced otherwise.

So, let's proceed.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge. Each has a charge of 2e.

So, the potential energy between the central charge (2e) and each of the 12 others is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r.

So, q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r = 2 m.

So U = k * (2e)(2e) / (2) = k * (4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Each such pair contributes 2 k e².

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait. Also, the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but they are themselves charged. So, their mutual interactions would contribute as well. But if we don't know their mutual distances, how can we compute that? So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore their mutual interactions, perhaps because it's a trick question or because the mutual terms are small.

Wait, but considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, but their mutual arrangement isn't specified, perhaps their mutual potential energy is zero. But that doesn't make sense because they are all at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the central charge, and the 12 others are fixed, so their mutual potential energies are considered zero. But that's not correct. Electrons (or these charges) in close proximity would have mutual potential energy.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps arranging the 12 charges as far apart as possible (on a sphere) would minimize the mutual potential energy. But the mutual potential energy between like charges is positive, so making them as far apart as possible would minimize the sum, making it as small as possible (i.e., less positive, but still positive).

However, without knowing the exact mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this part. Let's check the options. The options are in the order of 1e-26 J, except option D, which is way larger.

So, let's compute the energy considering only the central charge's interactions.

k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So, 2e is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

So U for each pair is (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, let's compute that.

Each U between central and a surrounding charge is:

U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) = k * (4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So, 2 * (8.988e9) * ( (1.602e-19)^2 ) * 4? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 4e² is (2e)^2, so 4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, no, earlier I said (2e)^2 is 4e², correct.

So, for each pair:

U = (k) * (2e) * (2e) / (2) = (k * 4 e²) /2 = 2 k e².

So, each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 k e².

So, the total is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Compute that:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So, compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute step by step.

First, compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.305e-28 = 5.532e-27 J.

Wait, so the total potential energy would be approximately 5.532e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, etc.

Wait, but I think I might have a mistake here. Let's redo the calculation precisely.

Compute 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2 m) for each term? Wait, no, earlier calculation was correct.

Wait, let me recheck:

Each U is 2 k e².

Because U = (k * 4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So 12 terms gives 24 k e².

So,

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

Compute k * e²:

8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) = 8.988 * 2.566e-29 = 23.05e-29 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 24: 2.305e-28 *24 = 5.532e-27 J.

Hmm, that's 5.532e-27 J. But none of the options match this exactly. Wait, the options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

So my calculation is about 5.53e-27, which is close to option C)7.056e-27, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

Compute e²:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approx (2.56697) x 10^-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N m²/C².

So, compute k * e²:

8.9875517879e9 * 2.56697e-38 = 

Let me compute 8.98755e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Multiply 8.98755 by 2.56697: approx 23.06.

So, 23.06 x 1e9 x 1e-38 = 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Then, multiply by 24: 2.306e-28 *24 = 55.344e-28 = 5.5344e-27 J.

So approximately 5.534e-27 J.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes, but the central charge is fixed, so perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of all interactions. So, the central charge interacts with each of the 12, which is 12 terms. Then, among the 12, each pair contributes. But without knowing their mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects you to compute only the first part, the central charge and the 12.

But my calculation of 5.53e-27 isn't matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me think again.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and they're at 2m from the central charge.

So, the potential energy for each pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m).

So that's (4e²k)/(2m) = 2e²k/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, right? So, 2/(2) =1.

So each pair contributes 2e²k.

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, so for each pair, it's (4e² k) / (2) = 2e² k.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2e²k.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I think I considered that correctly.

Wait, 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Wait, let's compute 24 * e² * k.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

k=8.988e9.

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 24: 5.532e-27 J.

So, same result as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from each other, not from the central charge. Wait, no, the problem says each is at 2m from point P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered. So, all the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. Let's think about the minimal energy.

Wait, but without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore that part. Or maybe the mutual potential energy is zero because they are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are so large that their potential energy is negligible. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, but each of the 12 charges is 2m away from P, and the central charge is fixed at P.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the entire system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. Since the 13th charge is fixed and the others are fixed at 2m from it, but their mutual distances are not specified, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, not their mutual interactions.

But then, why is that the minimum? Because if we consider the mutual interactions, the potential energy would be higher (since they are like charges, their mutual potential energy is positive and would add to the total). So, perhaps the minimum energy would be when we have the least possible mutual potential energy. But without their arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to compute only the central charge's part.

Given that, my calculation gives about 5.53e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 7.056e-27 J. That's about 1.27 times my calculated value. Hmm. Did I perhaps forget to multiply something else?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again numerically.

Compute 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, each of the 12 charges is at a distance r=2m from P. The central charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges contributes an energy of U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r.

So U = (4 e² k) / (2) = 2 e² k.

So per pair, 2 e² k.

12 pairs: 24 e² k.

Compute 24 * e² *k.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So:

24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) = ?

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 

Well, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 x 1e-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.05.

So 23.05e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 23.05e-29 = 553.2e-29 = 5.532e-27 J.

So, yes, same as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects me to consider something else.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is due to the configuration of all 13 charges, including the central one. But how?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each at 2m from P, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs involving the central charge, plus the sum of all pairs among the 12 charges.

But as I don't know the mutual distances between the 12, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore that part, assuming they are at infinity apart, so their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's not possible because they are all at the same point P's sphere, so their mutual distances can't be infinity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and the mutual terms are ignored. But then, why is the result not matching any option?

Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Let me think: each of the 12 charges is fixed at 2m from P. So the potential energy for each is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (4 e² k) / (2m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait no, m is 2 meters, so 2 e² k / 2 = e² k = 1.602e-19^2 * 8.988e9.

Wait, my mistake: the denominator is 2m, so m=2.

So U per charge is (4 e² k) / (2 * 2) = (4 e² k ) /4 = e² k.

Wait, that's different. Oh wait, because the distance is 2m, so r=2m.

So, U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) = (4e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Wait, no, that's correct. So each pair contributes 2 e² k.

So for 12 pairs, it's 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Which brings us back to the same calculation. So I think my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about gravitational potential energy, but no, the question says charge.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, e = 1.602e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 2.566 = approx 23.05.

10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So 23.05e-29 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.305e-28 = 55.32e-28 = 5.532e-27 J.

So same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, in the potential energy formula, U = (k q1 q2)/r.

But when considering multiple charges, each pair is counted once. So for 12 charges, each interacting with the central charge, that's 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the central charge's potential energy as the sum of the interactions with all 12, but perhaps the central charge is 2e, and each surrounding charge is 2e, so it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e)(2e) = 4e².

Wait, but that's what I used.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A)5.645 x10^-26 J

B)2.822 x10^-26 J

C)7.056 x10^-27 J

D)122.330 J.

So my calculation is 5.53e-27, which is closest to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges can't be ignored, but without their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects me to compute it as if all the 12 are at 2m from each other as well. But that's not correct; their mutual distances would depend on their positions on the sphere.

Wait, but if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, then the average distance between any two could be found, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the central charge and the 12, and the mutual terms are not part of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed at 2m from P, but perhaps the central charge is fixed, so the 12 charges are all at 2m from it, but the mutual distances are such that the mutual potential energy is zero because they're arranged symmetrically. But that doesn't make sense because symmetric arrangement would have mutual potential energies that sum up to a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they form a spherical shell around the central charge, and each is at 2m from P. Then, the mutual potential energy would have to be calculated based on that arrangement.

But without more information, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered negligible or zero. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the system is isolated, so all pairs contribute. But without their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the central charge and the 12 others, ignoring their mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem can't be solved with the given information.

So, given that, my calculation is 5.53e-27 J. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, let me think again. The potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) = (4 e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

So each pair contributes 2 e² k.

So 12 pairs contribute 24 e² k.

Wait, but perhaps the central charge is 2e, so when considering all the 12 charges, each contributes (2e) * (2e) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all possible pairs, including the central charge.

Wait, no, in the central charge and the 12 others, each surrounding charge is at 2m from P. So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) = 2 e² k.

So, 12 terms: 24 e² k.

Which is 5.53e-27 J.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let's compute e squared:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, e² * k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988 * 1e-29.

2.566 *8.988 is approximately 23.05.

So, 23.05e-29 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.305e-28 = 55.32e-28 = 5.532e-27 J.

Hmm. So this brings me back to the same result.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again more precisely.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Calculate e squared:

1.602e-19 * 1.602e-19 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566404e-38.

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566404e-38 = 8.988 *2.566404e-29.

8.988 *2.566404 ≈ 23.05.

So 23.05e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.05e-29 = 553.2e-29 = 5.532e-27 J.

Hmm. Again, same result.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for gravitational potential energy, not electrical. But the question says "charge", so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a ring or some other structure, but without that information, perhaps the problem expects us to only consider the central charge and the 12 others.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge to position.

But that approach would be similar.

Wait, another thought: maybe the potential energy is the total of all the interactions between the charges, including all pairs. So, 13 charges, each interacting with others.

Wait, but the 13th is fixed, so for each of the 12 charges, you have the interaction with the 13th (central charge), and each pair among the 12.

So, the total potential energy is:

U_total = U_central + U_mutual.

Where U_central is 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2) = 24 e² k.

And U_mutual is the sum of all pairs among the 12, which is C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

But without knowing the mutual distances, this can't be computed.

So perhaps the problem is intended to only consider U_central, which gives 5.53e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual terms and pick the closest option, but none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair is counted twice? No, in Coulomb's law, each pair is considered once. So for 12 charges, each has 11 interactions, but U is sum over all i<j.

Wait, no, in the case of the central charge, each of the 12 charges has a single interaction with the central charge, so 12 terms.

But perhaps the problem is considering the mutual potential energy as well. Without knowing their configuration, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a way that each is at 2m apart, but that's not possible for 12 charges.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's minimum energy is achieved when the 12 charges are placed at infinity, but that's not possible because they're constrained to stay at 2m from P.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each charge as being brought to 2m from P, so the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring each charge to 2m from P, considering the potential at P due to the central charge and the others already placed.

Wait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps the total potential energy is the sum of bringing each charge to its position, considering the potential already created by others.

So, the first charge: when you bring the first surrounding charge to 2m from P, the only charge present is the central charge (2e) at P. So the potential at 2m is due to the central charge.

The potential at 2m is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So, the work done to bring the first charge, which is 2e, from infinity to 2m is q * V = (2e) * (k e / 2) )= (2e) * (k e) / 2 = k e².

Wait, because V = (k q) / r. So for the central charge q=2e, r=2m.

So V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So the work done to bring the first charge is (2e) * (k e) )/ 2 ?

Wait, no, the work done is q * V, where V is the potential at the point where the charge is being brought to. So when bringing the first charge (2e), the potential at 2m is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So, the work done is (2e) * (k e) )/(2) ?

Wait, no, the work done is (charge) * (potential at destination). So it's (2e) * (k e / 2) ) = (2e) * (k e) / 2 = (2 * 1.6e-19 C) * (8.988e9 N m²/C² * 1.6e-19 C) / 2.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

The potential at 2m due to the central charge is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So, the work to bring a charge of 2e from infinity to 2m is W = q * V = (2e) * (k e) = 2 k e².

Wait, no, wait: V is the potential at the point where the charge is brought to, due to all other charges. So, in this case, the first charge is brought to 2m, where the potential is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So, the work done is (2e) * (k e) )= 2 k e².

But wait, that can't be right because each charge is 2e, so bringing each charge would involve this.

Now, the second charge: when bringing it to 2m, the potential at that point is due to the central charge (2e) and the first charge (2e) which is already at 2m.

So V = (k * 2e)/(2) + (k * 2e)/(distance between the two charges).

Wait, but the distance between the two charges is not given. If they're both at 2m from P, their separation depends on the angle between them. If they're diametrically opposite, the distance would be 4m. But in reality, without knowing the arrangement, perhaps we can't compute this.

But for the sake of argument, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2m apart, which is impossible for 12 points on a sphere. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the potential energy between the mutual charges is zero. But that's not correct.

Given that, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but my calculation isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate 24 * e² *k.

Let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 1.602e-19 squared: (1.602)^2 = 2.566404, so 2.566404e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566404e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566404 * 8.988) * 1e-29.

2.566404 *8.988 ≈ 23.05.

So 23.05e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.05e-29 = 553.2e-29 =5.532e-27 J.

Hmm. So, this seems correct.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not seeing the error.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each mutual pair contributes an energy of (k * (2e)^2) / (2m), but that doesn't make sense because the mutual distances are not 2m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, but I'm miscalculating the number of pairs.

Wait, the central charge is one, and each of the 12 is at 2m. So the number of central pairs is 12.

So, 12 * (k * (2e)*(2e)/(2)) )= 12 * (4e² k)/(2) = 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Which is what I did earlier.

So, 5.53e-27 J.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be in eV instead of Joules, but the options are in Joules.

Wait, let's compute 5.53e-27 J in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, 5.53e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.45e-8 eV.

But that doesn't help with the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should choose the closest option, which is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check Coulomb's law again.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = k Q1 Q2 / r.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy in a different way, such as summing all pairs, including both central and mutual.

But without knowing mutual distances, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's energy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation with precise numbers.

Compute e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.56697e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N m²/C².

So, e² * k = 2.56697e-38 *8.9875517879e9 = 2.56697 *8.98755e-29 = approx 23.05e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.05e-29 = 553.2e-29 =5.532e-27 J.

Hmm. So, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have 12 charges, each with charge e, not 2e. Because if the charges were e, then the energy would be 5.53e-27 /4 = 1.38e-27, which is still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. The problem says each charge is 2e. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at P due to the other 11.

Wait, but the central charge is fixed, so the potential at P due to the other 12 charges would be the sum of their potentials.

But the central charge is at P, so when considering the potential due to the other 12, each is at 2m from P.

So, the potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So, the total potential at P due to all 12 is 12 * k e.

Then, the potential energy of the central charge (2e) in this potential is U = q * V = (2e) * (12 k e ) = 24 k e².

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So, I think my approach is correct.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction.

Wait, no, potential energy is scalar.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 5.53e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is about the potential energy of the entire system, which includes all pairs. So, the central charge interacts with each of the 12, contributing 24 e² k.

The 12 charges interact with each other, each pair contributing (k (2e)^2 ) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and j.

But without knowing r_ij, can't compute this part.

But perhaps the problem assumes that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from each other as well, which would be the case if they're all at the same point, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a way that each is at 2m from each other, but that's not possible for 12 charges.

So, perhaps the mutual terms are considered zero, which is incorrect but perhaps the intended approach.

In that case, the total potential energy would be 5.53e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem is expecting me to do something else.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge and each other, so each mutual pair is at 2m apart.

In that case, the mutual potential energy would be (12 choose 2) * (k (2e)^2)/(2m).

So, 66 pairs, each contributing (4 e² k)/(2) = 2 e² k.

So, mutual U = 66 * 2 e² k = 132 e² k.

Then, the total U would be U_central + U_mutual = 24 e² k + 132 e² k = 156 e² k.

Which would be 156 * 2.305e-28 = 3.59e-26 J.

Which is close to option A (5.645e-26) and option B (2.822e-26), but not exactly.

Wait, 156 *2.305e-28 = 3.593e-26 J.

Hmm, but that's not matching any options. So perhaps that's not the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 4m, but that's just a guess.

If mutual distance is 4m, then U_mutual would be 66 * (k (2e)^2)/(4) )= 66 * (4 e² k)/(4) = 66 e² k.

So U_total = 24 e² k +66 e² k = 90 e² k =90 *2.305e-28= 2.0745e-26 J.

Which is close to option B (2.822e-26), but not exact.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2√2 m, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be only the central charge's contribution, and the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 1.602e-19^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.305e-28.

Multiply by 24:5.532e-27.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the charges to be treated as point charges, but perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, in the potential energy formula, each pair is counted once, so perhaps the formula is correct as is.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The closest option to my calculation is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.305e-28.

24 *2.305e-28 =5.532e-27.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to include the potential energy of the 12 charges as they are placed at 2m from P, considering the potential due to all other charges.

Let me think about it as bringing each charge one by one.

The first charge is brought from infinity to 2m. Only the central charge is present, so potential is k*(2e)/(2) =k e.

Work done: (2e) *k e =2 k e².

The second charge: when brought to 2m, the potential is due to the central charge and the first charge.

The potential due to central charge: k*(2e)/(2)=k e.

The potential due to first charge: k*(2e)/(distance between them).

Assuming the second charge is placed such that it's 2m from P and the first charge is also 2m from P, the distance between them is a function of their positions on the sphere. Let's assume they're placed diametrically opposite, so distance is 4m.

So, potential due to first charge is k*(2e)/4 = (k e)/2.

So, total potential at 2m when placing second charge is k e + (k e)/2 = (3/2) k e.

Work done: (2e) * (3/2 k e) )=3 k e².

Third charge: potential is due to central charge, first, and second.

Central: k e.

First: k*(2e)/(distance between third and first).

Second: k*(2e)/(distance between third and second).

Assuming the three are equally spaced on the sphere, the distances would be 2m * something.

But this is getting complicated, and without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute the potential energy for all 12 charges.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering only the central charge's contribution, which gives 5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it again with precise numbers.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 1.602e-19 squared:

1.602 *1.602 = 2.566404.

So, (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566404e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:

2.566404e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566404 *8.988 ) * 1e-29.

2.566404 *8.988 ≈ 23.05.

So, 23.05e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.05e-29 = 553.2e-29 =5.532e-27 J.

Hmm. So, I think my calculation is correct.

But since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times my result.

Wait, wait. Let me think: perhaps I should multiply by 2 somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility: the potential energy between two charges is (k q1 q2 ) / r, but perhaps the problem counts each pair twice, leading to a factor of 2.

But no, in the calculation of potential energy for a system, you only count each pair once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the absolute value, but that shouldn't change the magnitude.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me think: 12 charges each contribute to the central charge, so 12 terms, each with U=2 e² k.

So, 12 * 2 e² k =24 e²k.

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, which is similar.

But no, the question is about electric charges.

Hmm. I think I'll have to settle with my calculation of 5.53e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)^2)/(2), and then also considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) for each pair, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a mutual distance of 2m, making each pair contribute (k*(2e)^2)/(2) energy.

In that case, the mutual potential energy would be C(12,2) * (4 e² k)/(2) )=66 *2 e² k=132 e²k.

Adding that to the central charge's contribution, 24 e²k, the total would be 156 e²k =156 *2.305e-28=3.59e-26 J.

Which is close to option A)5.645e-26 J, but not exact.

Hmm. I'm not sure. I'll have to go with the initial approach and say the answer is approximately 5.53e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (3/2) * (k q^2)/r, but I don't recall such a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their mutual potential energy is zero because they're arranged symmetrically, which is not correct.

In that case, the total potential energy would be 5.53e-27 J.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 5.53e-27 J, but since this isn't an option, I'm probably missing something. Perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B.

But given the options, I'll have to make a choice. I'll go with option C)7.056e-27 J as the closest, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system consisting of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The energy of the system is determined by the electric potential energy between the charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Electric Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).

2. **Charges and Distances**:  
   Each charge is \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 12 charges are at a fixed distance of 2 meters from the central charge at \( P \). The mutual distances between the 12 charges are not specified, making it unclear how to compute their mutual potential energy contributions.

3. **Central Charge Interactions**:  
   The central charge interacts with each of the 12 charges. The potential energy for each pair is:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4e^2k}{2} = 2e^2k
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution from the central charge is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2e^2k = 24e^2k
   \]

4. **Mutual Potential Energy of the 12 Charges**:  
   The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. Without specific information about their distances, this contribution cannot be precisely calculated. The problem may assume this term is negligible or zero, which simplifies the calculation.

5. **Numerical Calculation**:  
   Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot 2.305 \times 10^{-29} = 5.532 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( 5.532 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 1.27 times the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the problem or an approximation in the options.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the lack of clarity regarding the mutual distances between the 12 charges, the most reasonable choice based on the calculations is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**.

Answer: C
