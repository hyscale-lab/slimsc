Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson field X. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question gives me the interaction Lagrangian as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ̄_f(y)ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might be misreading that. Oh, maybe it's L(y) = -λ_f f(y) [ψ̄_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)]? Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think the key part is that the boson X interacts with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different possible fermion pairs.

First, I should remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermion masses must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because in decay processes, each particle in the final state must have enough energy to exist. So the threshold is when the two fermions (like a quark and antiquark) each have mass m. Then 2m ≤ M_X, because the total energy has to be at least the sum of their masses. So m ≤ M_X / 2.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so M_X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced in pairs.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. Let's see:

Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV. So definitely allowed.
Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. Also allowed.
Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV. Less than 3 GeV, so allowed.
Quarks:
Up (u): ~0.005 GeV. Allowed.
Down (d): ~0.008 GeV. Allowed.
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV. Allowed.
Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV. Hmm, 1.5 is less than 3, so allowed.
Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's way above 3 GeV. So 4.5 is more than 3, so b quarks can't be produced because 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So b and anti-b can't be produced.

What about top quark (t)? Even heavier, around 173 GeV. So definitely can't decay into t t̄.

So the possible fermions allowed are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−. Wait, but b quarks are too heavy. So option A is out because it includes b's.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. So it includes c quarks, which are allowed, but what about the others? Let's check: m_c is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Option C: Includes t t̄, which we know isn't allowed, so option C is out.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. Again, the b's are too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option must be B. Let me double-check. The allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So the decay products would include each of their pairs.

Wait, the Lagrangian term: If the interaction is Yukawa type, then which fermions are involved? The Lagrangian is L = -λ f f(y) [ῡ + X(y)] ψ̄_f ψ_f. So it looks like X couples to all the fermions since f is a general index. So all fermions can interact with X, but only the ones with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be decay products.

So the allowed decay channels for X are into all pairs of these fermions, except those with m>3 GeV. So that includes e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options, only option B includes all these except b and t. Wait, option B includes c, which is allowed. So yes, B seems correct.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian and the fermion masses. The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Since \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the threshold for each fermion pair is \( m_f \leq M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses:
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Up (\( u \))**: \( \sim 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Down (\( d \))**: \( \sim 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Strange (\( s \))**: \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Charm (\( c \))**: \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Bottom (\( b \))**: \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Top (\( t \))**: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed)

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which are allowed. **Accepted**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), as listed in **Option B**.
