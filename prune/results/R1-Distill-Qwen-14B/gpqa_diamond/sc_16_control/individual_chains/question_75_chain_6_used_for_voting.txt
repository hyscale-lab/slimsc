Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the mouse model. The setup is a bit complex, but I'll go step by step.

So, the researcher made a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After selection with antibiotics, they tested the expression but couldn't overexpress the protein.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, it's the plus strand of the construct. Let me think about the structure of a gene construct, especially with an HA tag. The HA tag is usually added to the beginning of the coding sequence so that the protein starts with the HA epitope. 

Looking at the sequence, the very beginning is the ATG start codon. But wait, the HA tag is an additional sequence before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the correct way would be that the HA tag's coding sequence comes first, followed by the start codon for GADD45G.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So if the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, the construct should have the HA coding sequence before the ATG. Because when the mRNA is made, the HA would be translated first, followed by GADD45G. So if the construct starts with ATG, that's correct for the GADD45G. But what about the HA tag? The HA tag would be added upstream of the ATG in the coding sequence.

Wait a minute, the issue might be with the reading frame or the correct coding sequence for the HA tag. The HA tag is a short peptide, typically YPYDVPDYA. Its coding sequence is in frame. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence, then the ATG start for GADD45G.

Looking at the sequence, the very first part after the start is ATG. So that's correct for GADD45G. But how is the HA tag incorporated? Let me think. The HA sequence is added before the ATG. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence, then the ATG.

Wait, looking at the given sequence, the first nucleotides are ATG TAC..., which is the start codon (ATG) followed by TAC (tyrosine). So the coding sequence for HA would need to come before the ATG. But in the given sequence, the HA isn't present. Wait, no, the HA tag isn't in the sequence provided. That's confusing.

Wait, the user said they introduced the HA sequence into the coding sequence. So the HA coding sequence should be just after the promoter, followed by the ATG. If the HA isn't correctly incorporated, that might be the problem.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so maybe the HA wasn't added correctly. So the problem could be that the HA wasn't included. But the question says they introduced the HA. So perhaps the sequence is wrong, leading to a frameshift or incorrect reading.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the start codon is in the wrong frame. Let's see. The HA tag is about 11 amino acids. Let's say the HA coding sequence is added, then the ATG for GADD45G. So the HA would be in frame, then the GADD45G starts.

But if the HA's coding sequence was incorrectly added, perhaps the start codon is out of frame, leading to the ribosome not recognizing it or causing a frameshift. Another possibility is that the HA tag's sequence is messed up, causing a stop codon early on. 

Looking at the given sequence, the first codon is ATG (start). The second is TAC (tyrosine). Third is CAT (His). Wait, that's TAC CAT GAT... Hmm. Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence is usually something like ATG TAC TAC CAT GAT GAT TCC AGA TCC... Or wait, the HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, so the amino acids are Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Pro, Tyr, Ala. The codons would be: TAC (Tyr), CC A (Pro — wait, pro is CCA or CCU, but in DNA it's CCA), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val?), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the HA coding sequence is longer.

Wait, but if the HA wasn't correctly added, or if it's in the wrong phase, perhaps the ATG is in a different frame. Let me think: the plasmid should have the HA tag's coding sequence, then the ATG for GADD45G. If the HA is not in frame, the ATG might be in a different reading frame, making the GADD45G coding sequence start in the wrong frame. Alternatively, if the HA is inserted in the right frame, then the ATG is correctly positioned.

Wait, but the given sequence doesn't have any HA coding sequence before the ATG. So that suggests that the HA wasn't added. But the question states that they introduced the HA sequence. So maybe the HA was inserted in the wrong place. For example, perhaps the HA was inserted after the ATG, so the GADD45G starts first, then HA. But that's not the intended design, because HA should be at the N-terminus.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So if the HA is supposed to come first, but the construct doesn't have it, that's a problem. So the plasmid is missing the HA coding sequence. But the problem says that the HA was introduced, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted before the ATG, but in a way that the start codon is missing, or in a different frame, leading to no correct start.

Alternatively, maybe the HA coding sequence was inserted after the ATG, so the GADD45G is being expressed, but the HA isn't. But then the problem would be that the HA isn't present, but the GADD45G is expressed. But the problem states that the overexpression isn't happening. So maybe the HA is not correctly placed.

Wait, another possibility is that the ATG is followed by a stop codon early on, causing the ribosome to terminate quickly. Let me scan the beginning of the sequence.

The sequence starts: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTG CCT CAC TGC CCG CGC TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAA GCT TTA CGT GGT GAC CCC CGA CAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA G GAG GAC GAG GGCGACATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGG CGA TGT GCA GCG GCT GGC GGC CAT CGT GGC GCC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG CCG CAG CGT TAA CGA TGG GTG CCA CAG CAT CAC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, looking at the first few codons:

ATG (start) TAC (tyr) CCA (pro) TAC (tyr) GAT (as) GCT (al) TCC (ser) AGA (arg) TTA (leu) CGC (arg) CAA (gln) ATG (start) ACT (thr) CTG (leu) GAA (glu) GAA (glu) TCC (ser) GCG (ala) GCC (ala) AGG (arg) ACA (thr) CAG (gln) TTC (phe) CGG (arg) AAA (lys) GCA (ala) CAG (gln) CCA (pro) GGA (gly) TGC (cys) AGG (arg) GTG (val) CCG (pro) GGA (gly) AAG (lys) CGC (arg) TGC (cys) ATG (start) AGT (ser) TGC (cys) TGC (cys) TCG (ser) GCC (ala) GCA (ala) GCG (ala) TCA (ser) GGG (gly) CTG (leu) CCT (pro) CAC (his) TGC (cys) CCG (pro) CGC (arg) TCT (ser) AGC (ser) GAG (glu) TCA (ser) GCA (ala) AAA (lys) GCT (al) TTA (leu) CGT (arg) GGT (gly) GAC (asp) CCC (pro) CGA (arg) CAA (gln) TGT (cys) GAC (asp) CTT (leu) CTG (leu) TGT (cys) GCT (al) GGC (gly) TGC (cys) GGG (gly) TGA (stop) etc.

Wait, but wait, after the first ATG, the sequence continues. Let me see: the first few codons are Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Ala, Ser, Arg, Leu, Arg, Gln, etc. Now, maybe the HA tag's sequence is supposed to be right after the ATG, but if the HA is not in frame, the GADD45G might not be expressed correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the ATG is in the wrong reading frame because the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, so the GADD45G is not being translated. Let me think about the reading frame.

The HA tag is supposed to be in the same frame as the GADD45G. If the HA was inserted in a different frame, the start codon (ATG) might not be correctly positioned, leading to a frameshift and no proper translation.

Looking at the sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), followed by TAC. So that's in frame. But if the HA was inserted upstream of this ATG, but shifted, the frame would be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't correctly inserted, and the construct starts with GADD45G's ATG, but the HA is missing. So the GADD45G is expressed but without the HA tag, which may not be causing the lack of overexpression. Or perhaps the HA is not present, leading to other issues.

Wait, but the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening. So the protein isn't being made. Maybe the issue is that there's a stop codon early in the sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate.

Looking at the sequence, after the first ATG, the next codon is TAC, then CCA, TAC, GAT, etc. Are any of these a stop codon? The stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. In DNA, that's TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the initial codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT... So the first codon is ATG, then TAC (no stop), CCA (no stop), TAC (no), GAT (no), GCT (no), TCC (no), AGA (no), TTA (no), CGC (no), CAA (no), ATG (start), ACT (no), CTG (no), etc. So no stop codons in the first part.

But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. If the HA insert is in the wrong place, maybe the GADD45G isn't being expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence contains a stop codon. Let me see: the HA coding sequence is typically about 11 amino acids, so 33 nucleotides, in frame.

If the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation, perhaps the ATG is followed by a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA's coding sequence may have a stop codon if the sequence was incorrect.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, etc., so perhaps the HA wasn't added. So the construct might have the GADD45G directly, without the HA. But the problem states that the HA was introduced, so that may not be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted, but it's causing a frameshift. Because if the HA's coding sequence is inserted in the wrong frame, the reading frame shifts, leading to a premature stop codon in the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but the sequence provided is the correct GADD45G's coding sequence, right? Or is it altered?

Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand of the construct. The construct should include the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G's coding sequence. If the HA was inserted in frame, then the GADD45G's coding sequence is correctly in frame. But if not, the frame shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted after the ATG, leading to the GADD45G starting correctly, but the HA is in the same frame, but perhaps the initial HA causes a frame shift because its length is not a multiple of three.

Wait, the HA is 11 amino acids, which is 33 nucleotides. 33 is a multiple of three, so if inserted correctly, it won't cause a frame shift.

Wait, but if the HA was inserted before the ATG, but in a way that the ATG is not the start, the ribosome might not start there. So perhaps the ATG is in the middle of the HA sequence, leading to a different reading frame.

Another possibility: perhaps the HA was inserted without a proper Kozak sequence or other necessary elements for efficient translation initiation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

So the HA sequence might have a mutation, leading to a different amino acid. But would that prevent overexpression? Maybe not, unless it caused a stop codon or misfolding. But the problem says that the HA was introduced but the protein isn't expressed.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

That would mean a stop codon is present early in the sequence. But looking at the sequence, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the initial part. The first stop codon appears after a while—maybe at TGA somewhere? Let's look.

Looking through: ... TGA ... is present later. For example, in the sequence, after some point: ... TGA G GAG GAC GAG GGCGACATC ... Wait, the TGA is in the middle, which in DNA would be TGA. So that would be a stop codon at that point.

Wait, wait. Let's see: Looking at the sequence, there's a part that reads ... TGA G GAG ... So the 'TGA' is in the coding sequence. Let me count the position.

The part is: ... TGA ... Let me see:

Looking at the sequence, the part is:

... GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATC ...

Wait, no, another part: ... TGA ... Ah, here: ... GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA ...

I see a TGA towards the end. Let me count the letters. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the stop codon in the mRNA, which is the complementary sequence.

Wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA would be the complement of the DNA's template strand. Wait, the given sequence is the plus (coding) strand, same as mRNA except T for U. So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA, with U instead of T.

So in the plus strand, a TGA would be a stop codon because the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So in the initial part of the construct, the first codons are ATG (start), TAC, CCA, etc. But later in the sequence, there's a TGA. Let's count: perhaps it's in the middle of the coding sequence.

Wait, let me go through the sequence step by step:

Starting from ATG, the next codons are:

ATG (start), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GCT (Ala), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (start again?), ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), TCC (Ser), GCG (Ala), GCC (Ala), AGG (Arg), ACA (Thr), CAG (Gln), TTC (Phe), CGG (Arg), AAA (Lys), GCA (Ala), CAG (Gln), CCA (Pro), GGA (Gly), TGC (Cys), AGG (Arg), GTG (Val), CCG (Pro), GGA (Gly), AAG (Lys), CGC (Arg), TGC (Cys), ATG (start), AGT (Ser), TGC (Cys), TGC (Cys), TCG (Ser), GCC (Ala), GCA (Ala), GCG (Ala), TCA (Ser), GGG (Gly), CTG (Leu), CCT (Pro), CAC (His), TGC (Cys), CCG (Pro), CGC (Arg), TCT (Ser), AGC (Ser), GAG (Glu), TCA (Ser), GCA (Ala), AAA (Lys), GCT (Ala), TTA (Leu), CGT (Arg), GGT (Gly), GAC (Asp), CCC (Pro), CGA (Arg), CAA (Gln), TGT (Cys), GAC (Asp), CTT (Leu), CTG (Leu), TGT (Cys), GCT (Ala), GGC (Gly), TGC (Cys), GGG (Gly), TGA (Stop), etc.

Wait a second, that's interesting. The sequence has a second ATG a bit further along, which would be a start codon in the middle. That's a problem because the ribosome would translate from the first ATG until it hits the second ATG, which would be a start codon in the middle of the first ORF, causing the translation to terminate early.

Wait, but the second ATG is at position:

Let me count the codons:

After the initial ATG, the next is TAC (1), CCA (2), TAC (3), GAT (4), GCT (5), TCC (6), AGA (7), TTA (8), CGC (9), CAA (10), ATG (11). So the 11th codon is another ATG. That would cause the ribosome to start at the first ATG, then at the 11th codon, another start. But would that cause a problem?

In the construct, the HA is supposed to be at the beginning, followed by the GADD45G sequence. But if the HA wasn't added, the construct would start with GADD45G. But the given sequence starts with GADD45G, not HA. So perhaps the HA wasn't included, leading to a problem.

Wait, but the problem is that the HA was introduced. So the construct should have HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA wasn't added correctly, perhaps the GADD45G is not expressed. But in the given sequence, the GADD45G seems to be present, starting with ATG. So that's confusing.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the HA and GADD45G are in the same reading frame, but the HA's coding sequence is missing a start codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was inserted in a way that the ATG is part of the HA, but the HA's reading frame is messed up.

Alternatively, maybe the HA's coding sequence has a stop codon, so the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G isn't because the ATG is not correctly positioned.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted after the ATG, so the GADD45G starts first. But the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So if the HA is after GADD45G, then the HA is at the C-terminus, which is the opposite of what was intended.

But the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, the HA might have a stop codon.

Alternatively, the problem is that the HA wasn't added, but the initial ATG is correct, so GADD45G is being expressed. But the HA is supposed to be present for purification. Wait, but the issue is overexpression not happening.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted but introduced a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon in the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, looking at the sequence, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was inserted in a way that the frame shifts, causing the GADD45G's sequence to start in the wrong frame, leading to a stop codon somewhere.

But in the given sequence, the GADD45G coding seems to continue correctly. Unless the HA was inserted in reverse complement, which would cause the frame to shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is missing the promoter, but the problem states that the plasmid was transfected.

Wait, another possibility: the HA was inserted, but the Kozak sequence is missing. The Kozak sequence is important for initiation of translation in eukaryotes. If the HA tag is added without a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome might not initiate translation.

The Kozak sequence typically includes a 'gccRccAUGG' motif, where R is a purine (A or G) and the AUG is the start codon. If the HA tag's coding sequence doesn't have a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome might not initiate, so the HA isn't expressed, and perhaps the GADD45G's expression is affected if the HA is upstream.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the GADD45G starts with ATG, so that's correct. So perhaps the HA's coding sequence doesn't have a proper Kozak, but that's upstream of the ATG. Wait, no. The HA should be before the ATG. So if the HA's sequence was added without a proper Kozak, the ribosome might not read the ATG.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong orientation, leading to no HA tag and possibly disrupting the reading frame.

Wait, another option is that the HA tag's sequence has a stop codon within it. For example, if the HA's DNA sequence has a TGA, that would be a stop codon. Let me see: the HA coding sequence.

The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA. So the amino acids are:

Y P Y D V P D Y A

Which in DNA is:

Each codon:

Y: TAC or TAT
P: CCA or CCG
Y: TAC or TAT
D: GAT or GAA
V: GTT, GTC, GTA, GTR (where R is A, G, C)
P: CCA or CCG
D: GAT or GAA
Y: TAC or TAT
A: GCT, GCC, GCA, GCG (but wait, A is GCT?)

Wait, no, A is usually GCT, but sometimes GCA, etc. But the exact codons can vary as long as they code for the right amino acids.

If the HA's coding sequence has a TGA (stop codon), that would cause the ribosome to stop early. So if the HA's DNA has a TGA, the mRNA would have UGA, a stop codon. So the HA would be truncated, and the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed because the stop codon is in the HA's sequence, not allowing the ribosome to proceed to the GADD45G's start.

Looking back at the given DNA sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTG CCT CAC TGC CCG CGC TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAA GCT TTA CGT GGT GAC CCC CGA CAA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA G GAG GAC GAG GGCGACATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGG CGA TGT GCA GCG GCT GGC GGC CAT CGT GGC GCC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG CCG CAG CGT TAA CGA TGG GTG CCA CAG CAT CAC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, in the initial part of the sequence, the HA is supposed to be first, but the HA wasn't added, so the construct starts with ATG for GADD45G. So if the HA wasn't added, the GADD45G is expressed, but the HA isn't. But the problem states that the HA was introduced, so the HA should be there.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was introduced but in a way that the ATG is not recognized. For example, the Kozak consensus sequence is missing, so the ribosome doesn't start translating.

The Kozak sequence is important for the initiation of translation in eukaryotes. It typically includes a nucleotide at -3 (like 'A') and a purine at -1 relative to the start codon (ATG). If these elements are missing, the ribosome may not recognize the start codon, leading to little or no expression.

Looking at the given sequence, the first few nucleotides after the ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT..., so the sequence is TAC (at +3) CCA (positions +4-6), etc. The Kozak sequence is usually something like 'gccRccAUGG', where R is a purine. If the sequence before the ATG doesn't have the appropriate Kozak elements, the ribosome may not initiate translation, leading to no protein expression.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So perhaps the nucleotides before the ATG (upstream) are missing the Kozak sequence elements. For example, if the ATG is preceded by a T instead of a purine at position -1, or if the -3 position isn't a G or C.

Let me think: the plasmid's promoter and any regulatory elements would control transcription, but the translation initiation depends on the Kozak sequence. If the Kozak consensus isn't present, the ribosome might not start translating, leading to low or no expression.

Looking at the sequence, the ATG is the first codon, so the sequence before it (upstream) would be part of the 5' UTR. If the ATG isn't preceded by a purine at -1 and a G/C at -3, the ribosome may not efficiently initiate.

In the construct, the HA coding sequence should provide the necessary context for the Kozak sequence. If the HA wasn't correctly added, the context around the ATG might be incorrect. For example, if the ATG is preceded by a T instead of a G or A at position -1, the Kozak sequence is not optimal, and translation initiation is inefficient.

So, the problem could be that the construct lacks the proper Kozak sequence before the ATG, leading to the ribosome not initiating translation. Thus, the GADD45G protein isn't expressed, leading to no overexpression.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would imply a stop codon is present. But earlier I noticed that there's a TGA later in the sequence. Wait, let me check again.

Looking at the sequence, the TGA is present. So the first ATG is at the beginning, and then the mRNA is translated until it hits TGA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate early, producing a truncated protein.

But if the HA was added correctly, the TGA would be in the HA's sequence, not in the GADD45G's. Wait, but in the given sequence, the GADD45G's coding sequence continues beyond the TGA. Because the TGA is part of the HA tag's coding sequence, perhaps.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think differently.

The construct should have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA's coding sequence has a TGA (stop codon) within it, the ribosome would stop translating at that point, never reaching the GADD45G's ATG. So the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed, leading to no overexpression.

In the given DNA sequence, the HA's coding sequence should be before the GADD45G's ATG. But in the sequence provided, the first codon is ATG for GADD45G, implying that the HA wasn't added upstream. But the problem states that the HA was introduced, so perhaps the HA's coding sequence was inserted in the wrong place, leading to a stop codon in the HA.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence itself has a stop codon, such as TGA, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early.

So if the HA's coding sequence contains a TGA, the mRNA would have a UGA, causing a stop. For example, if the HA's DNA has a TGA, the mRNA would have UGA, leading to termination.

Looking at the given sequence, the initial part after the ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT..., which are the first codons of GADD45G. But if the HA's coding sequence was incorrectly inserted and includes a TGA, then the HA would be truncated, and the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the GADD45G's coding sequence continues past the TGA. So perhaps the TGA is in the middle of the GADD45G's coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, but that would mean the GADD45G is not expressed fully. So the protein is truncated, which may not be detectable, leading to no overexpression.

But looking at the sequence, the TGA is towards the end. Let me count the codons:

The first ATG is codon 1, then 2, 3, etc., up to the TGA which is ... I think around codon 80 or so. So the GADD45G's coding sequence is longer than that, so the TGA would be a premature stop.

But wait, the GADD45G should be a longer protein, so having a stop codon in the middle would prevent full-length expression.

But according to the given sequence, the TGA is at the end of the sequence, right before the 'GAGGAGGACGAG...' part. Wait, no, let me look again.

Ah, I see 'TGA G GAG GAC GAG...'. So the TGA is in the middle of the sequence. So the mRNA would have a UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate at that point, leading to a shorter protein than expected.

So the problem is that the construct has a TGA in the middle, causing the ribosome to stop early. Therefore, the GADD45G isn't fully expressed, leading to no overexpression.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would be the case here, due to the TGA in the coding sequence.

But why is there a TGA in the sequence? Because the HA's coding sequence wasn't properly added, or perhaps the HA's sequence introduced a TGA.

Wait, but the HA's coding sequence shouldn't have a stop codon. So perhaps the HA's DNA was mutated, introducing a TGA. That would cause the HA to have a stop codon, leading to early termination.

So option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. A missense mutation changes an amino acid, but if it introduces a stop codon, that's a nonsense mutation, not missense. So option A is about a missense, not a stop. So perhaps option A isn't the correct answer.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would align with the presence of a stop codon in the construct, like the TGA present in the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA sequence has a stop codon, causing the ribosome to stop before reaching the GADD45G's ATG.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so the GADD45G's coding sequence is present. If the HA's coding sequence was correctly added before the ATG, then the TGA in the middle would be part of the HA's sequence, which would introduce a stop codon in the HA, leading to the HA being truncated and the ribosome moving on to the next start codon.

Wait, but after the TGA in the sequence, there's another ATG. So the ribosome would stop at the TGA, then perhaps another ribosome could initiate at the next ATG, leading to a smaller protein.

But in the given sequence, the TGA is followed by G GAG GAC GAG..., which is after the TGA. So the DNA after the TGA is GGA GAG GAC GAG..., which would be mRNA as GGA GAG GAC GAG..., but the TGA is the stop codon.

So the presence of a TGA (UGA in mRNA) would cause the ribosome to terminate at that point, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. So the protein wouldn't be overexpressed because it's not being fully made.

So the reason is that there's a TGA in the coding sequence, causing early termination. Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early.

Wait, but option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. That would mean the protein is made but degraded. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made in the first place.

So the issue is that the ribosome is terminating early due to a premature stop codon. So the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes an HA tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence, and the provided DNA sequence represents the coding strand. The key issue lies in analyzing the sequence and identifying why translation is not occurring as expected.

1. **Construct Design**: The construct should include the HA tag upstream of the GADD45G coding sequence, ensuring the HA tag is translated first, followed by GADD45G. The HA tag's coding sequence should be in frame with the GADD45G sequence to maintain proper translation.

2. **Sequence Analysis**: The provided sequence starts with the GADD45G coding sequence, as indicated by the initial `ATG` (start codon). However, the sequence lacks the HA tag upstream of this `ATG`, which contradicts the intended design. This suggests that the HA tag was either not added or was incorrectly inserted.

3. **Premature Stop Codon**: Scanning the sequence reveals the presence of a `TGA` codon (stop codon in DNA, corresponding to `UGA` in mRNA) later in the sequence. This stop codon would terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length GADD45G protein from being expressed. The ribosome would stop at this point, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein.

4. **Kozak Sequence**: The efficiency of translation initiation in eukaryotes depends on the presence of a Kozak consensus sequence (e.g., `gccRccAUGG`) near the start codon. If the HA tag was not correctly incorporated, the sequence upstream of the `ATG` may lack the necessary Kozak elements, further reducing or preventing translation initiation.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: "The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation."  
  This option refers to a mutation that changes an amino acid in the HA tag. However, the issue here is not a missense mutation but the presence of a premature stop codon (`TGA`), which is a nonsense mutation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: "The ribosome terminated the translation early."  
  The presence of the `TGA` codon in the sequence explains why the ribosome terminates translation prematurely. This prevents the full-length GADD45G protein from being expressed, aligning with the observation of no overexpression. This option is correct.

- **Option C**: "The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain."  
  Proteolysis refers to the degradation of the protein after it is synthesized. However, the problem is that the protein is not being expressed at all, not that it is being degraded. This option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: "The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse."  
  The sequence contains a `TGA` stop codon, not a `UAA` codon. Additionally, tRNA availability is not the issue here, as the problem lies in the construct design and premature termination. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue is the premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. This prevents the full-length GADD45G protein from being expressed, leading to the lack of overexpression.
