Okay, so I've got this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? And Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, maybe rhodium or ruthenium-based. Oh wait, Grubbs is typically a ruthenium-based catalyst.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, does that affect the product? Because if the starting material is a racemic mixture, but the reaction is stereospecific or maybe not stereoselective, how does that play in?

So, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me sketch that out. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, but I'm getting confused. So let me count. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would imply a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no, it's 3-methyl, so the third carbon is CH(CH3). So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, let me think again. Pent has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But 3-methyl would add a methyl group on C3. So, the third carbon (CH2) would become CH(CH3). So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait wait, wait: wait, the correct IUPAC name is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the parent chain is pentene, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make it 3-methyl, correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I should move forward and see how it's going.

So, Grubbs catalyst would induce olefin metathesis. Metathesis typically breaks the double bond and reforms new ones. So, the reaction could either be a ring-closing metathesis or a cross-metathesis if there are other alkenes present. But since the question is about racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-closing metathesis. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis? Wait, no, ring-opening is more for cyclic alkenes. So perhaps the molecule is undergoing a ring-closing metathesis, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene isn't a cyclic compound. Oh, wait, perhaps the molecule is such that upon metathesis, it forms a ring. Let me think.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So when Grubbs is added, the double bond could undergo metathesis. Let me imagine where the possible breaks and reforms could happen.

In metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond into two metal alkylidene complexes, and then those can recombine. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is a straight-chain molecule with a double bond between C1 and C2, the metathesis can cause different products based on where the exchange occurs.

Wait, but in this case, since it's a four-membered chain (because pent-1-ene is five carbons, so the double bond is at the first position), when metathesis occurs, perhaps it could form a ring. Let me see: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps during metathesis, the two ends (the two CH2 groups) could form a ring. So, maybe the catalyst breaks the double bond and then the ends connect in a way that forms a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis isn't ring-closing but rather just a redistribution. Wait, but Grubbs catalyst is good for ring-closing as well. So, perhaps the molecule can form a cyclic product.

Wait, let's count the carbons. The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is five carbons. So, if the metathesis forms a ring, perhaps a four-membered ring (like a cyclobutane derivative) or a five-membered ring.

Wait, when the double bond is between C1 and C2, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, if the catalyst causes the two ends to connect, perhaps the CH2 from the far end could connect to the CH2 next to the double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes.

Wait, for olefin metathesis, the general process is that two alkenes exchange partners. But in this case, perhaps the same molecule is undergoing an internal metathesis. So, maybe the molecule will form a ring by connecting two ends.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. So, the molecule is:
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If I break the double bond into two carbene or metal complexes, perhaps the ends can exchange partners. Let me imagine the possibilities.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would facilitate the formation of a ring by connecting two ends of the molecule. So, in this case, perhaps the metathesis will form a four-membered ring or a five-membered ring.

Wait, four-membered ring would imply that two CH2 groups would form a ring. Alternatively, maybe a five-membered ring.

Wait, but the original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, if the catalyst causes the metathesis between the two ends, perhaps the double bond could break, and the ends connect in a way that forms a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could undergo a cross metathesis with itself, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the possible products. The question asks how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. So, ethene would be a byproduct perhaps, but we're to exclude it.

So, during metathesis, the original double bond breaks, and new alkenes are formed. Let's think about all possible alkenes that can form.

In this case, 3-methylpent-1-ene, when treated with Grubbs, might form a ring or other alkenes. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring-closing metathesis, forming either a cyclopentene or a smaller ring. Let's see:

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it could form a ring by connecting the CH2 at the end with the CH2 near the double bond.

Wait, but the positions need to be such that the ring formed is the most stable. Let me think: if the ends are connected, say, between C1 and C5, forming a five-membered ring. But the current structure is straight, so to form a five-membered ring, the ends need to be connected.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a four-membered ring? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine breaking the double bond and then reconnecting in a way that forms a ring.

But maybe it's easier to think about possible products. Let me think about all possible alkenes that can form from this molecule upon metathesis.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs catalyst is used, the double bonds can undergo redistribution. So, the initial double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, the double bond could form between different pairs of carbons.

Let me list all possible double bonds that can form in the molecule.

Original structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Possible new double bonds:

- Between C2 and C3: CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH-CH3? No, that's not possible because the original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, perhaps if the double bond shifts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, in metathesis, the bonds are broken and reformed between different carbons. So, the product can have a different arrangement. Let me think.

Wait, in metathesis, the catalyst cleaves the double bond into two metal carbene complexes, which can then recombine in different ways. So, perhaps the two ends can exchange partners.

So, in this case, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The possible new alkenes could be formed by different combinations.

Wait, perhaps the product could be a different alkene, like 2-methylpent-2-ene or something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ring. For example, a five-membered ring would require the ends to connect. So, if the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, to form a five-membered ring, the CH2 at the end (C5) would connect to the CH at C2.

Wait, let me see. If the CH2-CH3 (C5) connects to the CH-CH2 (C2), that would form a ring. So, the ring would have five members: the original C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 connected back.

Wait, but no, because for a five-membered ring, the chain would need four bonds between the two connecting points. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs is used, the double bond can undergo a shift. So, the initial double bond is between C1 and C2. Maybe after metathesis, the double bond could be between C2 and C3, or between C3 and C4, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a ring formation, like cyclopentane derivative.

Wait, perhaps the most straightforward way to approach this is to consider all possible products of ring-closing metathesis.

So, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me imagine the two ends of the molecule. The double bond is at the beginning, so perhaps the molecule can form a ring by connecting the end (C5) to a position further up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in the formation of a cyclopentene derivative.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not visualizing the structure properly. Maybe I should draw it out.

So, structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, perhaps the double bond moves, or a ring is formed.

Wait, another angle: the Grubbs catalyst would cause the metathesis to occur between the two ends. So, if the molecule has a double bond at the end, Grubbs might cause it to form a ring.

So, the molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the catalyst causes the end (CH3-CH2-) to connect with the CH2= part, then perhaps a ring forms.

Wait, so breaking the double bond, the catalyst would have two ends: one from the CH2= and the other from the CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps the two ends can rearrange. So, the CH2-CH3 and the CH2- parts might form a new double bond.

Wait, I'm not quite getting it. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

When Grubbs is used, it's possible to get different products based on the positions where the metathesis occurs. So, in this case, the starting material is a five-carbon molecule with a double bond at the end. Grubbs can cause the ends to form a ring.

So, the possible ring products could be a four-membered ring or a five-membered ring.

Wait, but a four-membered ring would require connecting the ends in such a way that there are four atoms in the ring. So, for example, from C1 to C4, that would be four atoms (C1, C2, C3, C4), forming a four-membered ring. But wait, that would require the chain to be four carbons long, which it is not. Let me see.

Wait, the molecule is five carbons long. So, if the catalyst causes the first and fourth carbons to connect, that would form a four-membered ring (C1, C2, C3, C4 connected). Alternatively, connecting C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring.

Hmm.

Let's imagine that the metathesis forms a ring. So, the product would be a cyclic alkene.

If the ring is a four-membered ring, the product would be cyclobutane derivative, but with substituents. If it's a five-membered ring, the product would be cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, but let's count the possible products.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so perhaps the product could have different stereoisomers.

Wait, but the question is how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction can form more than one product, depending on where the metathesis occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis occurs in such a way that the same molecule can form different alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the initial molecule can form two different alkenes. Let me think: from 3-methylpent-1-ene, after metathesis, perhaps the double bond can shift to between C2 and C3, or between C3 and C4, etc.

Wait, but in Grubbs, you can get different products based on where the metathesis occurs.

Let me think about the possible products:

1. The molecule could form a five-membered ring, which would be cycloalkene.

But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has five carbons. So, if you connect C1 and C5, perhaps you get a five-membered ring. Wait, but that would require the chain to be long enough. Let me count:

If the initial structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, and you connect the ends, it would form a ring with five members: CH2-CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 (but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the ring as formed from the two ends of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis breaks the double bond and recombines the ends, leading to a new structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene derivative. Let me imagine that. So, the product would have a five-membered ring with a double bond, and a substituent (methyl group) attached.

Alternatively, maybe it forms a smaller ring, like a cyclobutene.

Wait, but let's think about the possible products in terms of the number of carbons. The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is five carbons. So, if a ring is formed, the ring would have between four and five carbons.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could produce two different alkenes. For example, if the double bond shifts to a different position, creating either 2-methyl-... or another structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of more than one product, such as a larger ring and a smaller ring, or different alkenes.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products.

If Grubbs catalyst causes the ring-closing metathesis, the product would be a cyclic alkene. The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene (five carbons), so when it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it would form a cyclopentene with a substituent.

Wait, the substituent would be the methyl group from the original molecule. So, the product would be 2-methylcyclopentene or 3-methylcyclopentene, depending on where the substituent ends up.

Wait, another point: the starting material is racemic, so it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But since Grubbs is a chiral catalyst? Or is it achiral? Wait, Grubbs catalyst itself is usually achiral, so the reaction may not proceed with any specific stereochemistry. But wait, no, the reaction can have some stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is racemic, so maybe the products will have different stereoisomers, but the question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are multiple due to different regioselectivity.

Wait, perhaps the reaction can form two different alkenes.

Let me think about the possible alkenes that can be formed from 3-methylpent-1-ene via metathesis.

Option 1: The double bond remains in the same position, but perhaps the molecule forms a ring, leading to a cyclic product.

Option 2: The double bond shifts, leading to a different alkene structure.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs can perform both ring-closing and cross metathesis. Since this is a single molecule, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic product. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule can form two different cyclic products, depending on where the connection happens. For example, connecting to form a four-membered ring or a five-membered ring.

But wait, a four-membered ring would require a connection between the first and fourth carbons. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one possible product because the substituents can end up in different positions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible alkenes.

If the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, after metathesis, perhaps the double bond can form in different positions.

But in metathesis, the catalyst can break the double bond and then the resulting ends can recombine in different ways. So, perhaps the product could have the double bond between C2 and C3, or between C3 and C4, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a mixture of different alkenes, each with different substituents.

Wait, another approach: the possible products of Grubbs metathesis on 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Grubbs can cause the exchange of the ends, so perhaps it can form a new alkene by reconnecting the ends in a way that brings together different carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-methylcyclopentene.

Wait, maybe the product is a single product, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the question is how many possible products are there, excluding ethene. So, perhaps the answer is more than one.

Wait, perhaps the reaction can form two different products, each with a different structure.

But I'm not quite getting it. Let me think about the possible alkenes.

The starting molecule has a double bond at C1-C2. The possible new double bonds after metathesis could be between C2-C3, C3-C4, or C4-C5. But wait, can the double bond form at those positions?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a larger ring, so the product is a cyclopentene, which is a ring with five members, one double bond.

So, in that case, how many different cyclopentene products could form? Well, the substituents would determine that.

Wait, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which has a methyl group on C3. So, when the ring forms, the methyl group would be attached to the ring in a specific position.

But the ring could form in such a way that the methyl group is on a specific carbon of the ring.

Wait, if the ring forms connecting C1 and C5, then the ring would have five members, and the substituent (methyl) would be on C3. So, the product would be 3-methylcyclopentene.

Alternatively, if the ring forms a different way, perhaps the substituent ends up on a different position, leading to another product.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position doesn't vary, leading to only one product.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so perhaps the product could have two enantiomers, but they are considered the same product because they're stereoisomers, not different compounds.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products, so if the product is a single compound, it's one product, regardless of any possible stereoisomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces two different alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the product can form a four-membered ring and a five-membered ring, leading to two different products.

But then, how would the four-membered ring form?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible rings:

Option 1: A four-membered ring, like cyclobutene with substituents.

Option 2: A five-membered ring, cyclopentene with substituents.

So, the product could be either, leading to two possible products.

But wait, I'm not sure if both are possible. Alternatively, perhaps only one ring size is favored.

Wait, but Grubbs tends to favor the formation of the more stable rings, which are usually five or six-membered. So, a five-membered ring would be more likely.

But if both are possible, then it's two products.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, another approach: let's count the possible alkenes produced.

If the double bond can form between different pairs of carbons, each possible double bond position would give a different product.

So, the possible double bonds in the molecule after metathesis could be between:

- C1 and C2 (same as starting material, but perhaps not a product as it's the same)
- C2 and C3
- C3 and C4
- C4 and C5

Wait, but for each possible double bond, there might be a different product.

But wait, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If metathesis occurs, perhaps the catalyst can break the double bond and allow the ends to form new double bonds.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about possible products.

In this case, Grubbs would break the double bond, and the two parts can recombine in various ways.

So, the initial molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

When Grubbs is applied, the catalyst breaks the double bond, making two metal carbene complexes. Then, these can recombine in different ways.

So, the possible new alkenes could form between different positions.

Alternatively, the same molecule could recombine into a ring, which is a new product.

So, let's consider that:

1. The molecule could form a ring, which would be a new product, say, a cyclopentene with a methyl group.

2. It could form a different alkene without a ring, such as 2-methylpent-2-ene.

But how many alkenes can form?

Wait, perhaps I should consider all possible alkenes that can be formed by connecting the ends in different ways.

Another approach: the number of possible products is determined by the possible ways the molecule can undergo metathesis. Each possible way leads to a different product.

But I'm not entirely certain, so perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about the possible products.

Wait, I think that when 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes ring-closing metathesis with Grubbs, it forms a cyclopentene derivative. But the substituents would determine how many different products are formed.

Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene is a straight-chain molecule with a methyl group on the third carbon. So, when the ring forms, the methyl group would be on the third carbon of the cyclopentene, which would make it 3-methylcyclopentene.

But then, would that be the only product? Or are there others.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can also form a different product, such as 2-methylcyclopentene, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, leading to different stereoisomers. But since Grubbs is an achiral catalyst, it may not favor any particular stereochemistry, leading to a racemic mixture of that product. But the question is about the number of products, not their stereochemistry, so that wouldn't increase the count.

Wait, but if the ring closes in two different ways (leading to different ring positions for the substituent), then that would give two products. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position is fixed, so only one product forms.

So, I'm getting a bit stuck on whether the product is a single compound or multiple.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead shifts the double bond, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the double bond can shift to between C2 and C3, forming 2-methylpent-2-ene, or between C3 and C4, forming another structure.

But in that case, how many different alkenes can form?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to two different alkenes, each with a different structure.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the problem is multiple-choice, with options from A to D. The options are 4, 8, 6, and 2.

Wait, perhaps the number of products is 2, making the answer D) 2.

But I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. When treated with Grubbs, the possible products are either a ring or a different alkene.

If the ring forms, it's cyclopentene with a methyl group. But the position of the methyl group depends on where the ring closes.

Wait, let's imagine the molecule:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the metathesis occurs between the first and fifth carbons, the ring would have five members. The structure would be cyclopentene with a methyl group on one of the carbons.

But which carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring formation leads to the methyl group being on the adjacent carbon to the ring's double bond.

Wait, but I'm not getting it. Perhaps the number of possible products is 2, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can form two different alkenes—so D) 2 is the answer.

Wait, but another thought: the starting material is a racemic mixture. So, perhaps when the metathesis occurs, each enantiomer would form a different product. But since the product is the same compound, it wouldn't increase the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can form two different alkenes, each with different substituents or positions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes. For example, the double bond could form between C2 and C3 or between C3 and C4, leading to two different products.

So, that would give two products, so the answer would be D) 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to four different products, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible alkenes that can form.

The original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, possible alkenes could be:

1. 2-methylpent-2-ene: structure would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis doesn't form a ring but instead forms a different alkene, such as 3-methylpent-2-ene.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that the starting material can form two different alkenes via different metathesis pathways, leading to two products.

So, the total number of products (excluding ethene) would be two.

So, the answer would be D) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, a transition metal catalyst commonly used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the redistribution of carbon-carbon double bonds by breaking and reforming them, often leading to the formation of new alkenes or cyclic products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene**:  
   The molecule is a five-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl group attached to C3. Its structure is:  
   $$\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}-\text{CH}(\text{CH}_3)-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_3.$$

2. **Grubbs Catalyst and Metathesis**:  
   Grubbs catalyst can induce both ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and cross-metathesis. In this case, the focus is on the possible products of metathesis, excluding ethene.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - **Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM)**:  
     The molecule can undergo RCM, forming a cyclic product. Connecting the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5) would result in a five-membered ring, specifically **3-methylcyclopentene**.  
   - **Alternative Alkenes**:  
     The double bond can also shift to different positions, forming alkenes such as **2-methylpent-2-ene** or **3-methylpent-2-ene**, depending on the specific recombination of the molecule.

4. **Exclusion of Ethene**:  
   Ethene (a byproduct of metathesis) is explicitly excluded from the count of possible products.

5. **Racemic Mixture Consideration**:  
   While the starting material is racemic, Grubbs catalyst is achiral, and the reaction does not favor stereoselectivity. Thus, the stereochemistry of the products does not increase the count of distinct products.

6. **Counting Products**:  
   Based on the analysis, the reaction can produce two distinct products:  
   - A five-membered cyclic product (3-methylcyclopentene).  
   - A non-cyclic alkene (e.g., 2-methylpent-2-ene or 3-methylpent-2-ene).  

   These represent the two possible products formed from the reaction, excluding ethene.

### Conclusion:
The number of possible products formed from the reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, excluding ethene, is **2**.

**Answer: D**
