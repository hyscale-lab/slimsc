Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), right? So that looks like the equation of a circle in 2D. Because x² + y² = 4 would be a circle of radius 2. But here, the denominator is 4 minus that. So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, and the metric blows up. That suggests there's a singularity at x² + y² =4.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So it's like a hyperbolic space, but embedded in a particular way.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the setup. The metric here is given in terms of x and y coordinates. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional space, like a surface embedded in higher dimensions, but described by these coordinates.

In 2D Riemannian geometry, the area element is usually something like sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant should be the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². So the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, no, wait. The metric is written as ds² = (32/(4−x²−y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the coefficients of dx² and dy² are the same, which means this is a conformally flat metric. So the determinant g is (32/(4−x²−y²))².

But when calculating the area, we integrate the area element sqrt(g) over the region where the metric is defined. Wait, but wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal and both components are the same, the area element would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, no, wait. Because the metric is expressed as [32/(4−x²−y²)] (dx² + dy²), the metric tensor g_ij is diagonal with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4−x²−y²), and g_xy = 0, and the same for g_yx. So the determinant is (32/(4−x²−y²))². So the square root of the determinant is 32/(4−x²−y²).

Wait, no, wait a second. The determinant for a diagonal metric is (g_xx)*(g_yy), because it's 2x2. So (32/(4−x²−y²)) * (32/(4−x²−y²)) ) equals (32²)/(4−x²−y²)^2. So the sqrt of that would be 32/(4−x²−y²). So the area element is [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the area would then be the integral of [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy over the region where 4−x²−y² > 0, because the denominator must be positive to have real coordinates. So the region is x² + y² < 4. So the integration limits are a circle of radius 2.

But wait, that seems a bit odd because if I integrate over a finite area, I might get a finite result. But let me set up the integral in polar coordinates, which might simplify things. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me separate the integrals:

A = ∫₀^2π dθ ∫₀^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

The integral over θ is straightforward: it's 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫₀^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²).

Hmm, substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr. So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is 32 * [ - (1/2) ∫ (1/u) du ) ].

= 32 * [ - (1/2) ln|u| ) ] + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. Wait, but when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches zero. So the integral is from u=4 down to u=0.

Wait, but let me rewrite the integral limits correctly. When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the substitution would be:

∫ (from r=0 to r=2) [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) = ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [32 ( (-du/2) ) / u ].

Which is equal to ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [32 * (-1/2) (1/u) du ]

= ∫ (4 to 0) [ -16 (1/u) du ]

= ∫ (0 to 4) 16 (1/u) du → because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

Wait, no: Let me think again. The substitution gives:

u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So when r =0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (32) * ( - du/(2u) )

So that's:

32 * ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-1)/(2u) ) du ]

Wait, wait, the substitution gives:

∫ [32 r dr/(4−r²)] = ∫ [32 ( (-du/2) ) / u ]

So that's 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Which is same as -16 ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

But integrating from a higher limit to a lower is the same as negative of integrating from lower to higher:

-16 [ ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du ] → because ∫ (4→0) = - ∫ (0→4) → so:

= -16 [ - ln(u) from 0 to 4 ]

Which is -16 [ (-ln(4) + ln(0) ) ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So this becomes -16 [ (-ln 4) + (-infty) ) ].

Hmm, that would imply that the integral is divergent. Because as r approaches 2, u approaches 0, and 1/u approaches infinity.

Wait, but that suggests that the integral ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] from 0 to2 diverges. If that's the case, the area would be infinite.

Wait, but that's confusing. Because the metric describes a pseudosphere. I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, let me think. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its total Gaussian curvature is negative, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area of such a surface would actually be infinite. Because, in hyperbolic space, the area grows exponentially as you move away from a point.

Wait, but in the metric given, the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. The integral over r from 0 to 2 (since beyond that, the denominator becomes negative, making the metric imaginary). So the region is a disk of radius 2. But in the denominator, when r approaches 2, the area element becomes very large.

Wait, so as r approaches 2, the area element becomes infinite, making the area integral divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The metric is given as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Let me see what the Gaussian curvature is for this metric. Because for a pseudosphere, the curvature is negative.

The formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates (since this is a conformal metric) is K = - (1/(2r^2)) (Δ ln r), where r is the conformal factor. Wait, maybe I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, for a metric of the form ds² = E (dx² + dy²), where E is a function, the Gaussian curvature K is given by K = (-1/(2E)) * Δ(ln E), where Δ is the Laplacian.

Wait, let me compute E here. E = 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So E = 32/(4 - r²).

Now, compute the Laplacian of ln(E):

Δ(ln E) = Δ( ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) )

ln(32) is a constant, so its Laplacian is zero. So Δ(ln E) = Δ( -ln(4 - r²) )

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of a radially symmetric function f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr). So:

d/dr [ln(4 - r²)] = (1/(4 - r²)) * (-2r) )= (-2r)/(4 - r²).

So df/dr is (-2r)/(4 - r²).

Now, (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr) ) = (1/r) d/dr [ r * (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ]

= (1/r) d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ]

Let me compute this derivative:

d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-2)(2r)(4 - r²) ) - (-2 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, that's using the quotient rule: d/dr [numerator/denominator] = (num’ * denominator - numerator * denominator’) / denominator^2.

Numerator is -2 r². Denominator is 4 - r².

Numerator’ = -4 r.

Denominator’ = -2 r.

So putting it together:

[ (-4 r)(4 - r²) ) - ( (-2 r²)(-2 r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Compute each term:

First term: (-4 r)(4 - r²) = -16 r + 4 r³.

Second term: (-2 r²)(-2 r) = 4 r³.

So the numerator becomes:

(-16 r +4 r³) - (4 r³) ) = -16 r + 0 = -16 r.

So the derivative is (-16 r) / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, multiply by (1/r) because of the Laplacian:

(1/r) * [ (-16 r) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ] = (-16) / (4 - r²)^2.

So Δ(ln E) = (-16)/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by ( -1/(2 E) ) * Δ(ln E) ).

Substituting E = 32/(4 - r²) and Δ(ln E) = (-16)/(4 - r²)^2.

So K = [ -1/(2 * (32/(4 - r²)) ) ] * [ (-16)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Let me compute this step by step:

First, 2 * (32/(4 - r²)) ) is 64/(4 - r²).

So 1/(2 E) ) = (4 - r²)/(64) → since E =32/(4 - r²), 1/E is (4 - r²)/32. So 1/(2 E) is (4 - r²)/(64).

So K = ( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * [ (-16)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

= [ (4 - r²) * (-16) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^2) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The (4 - r²) in numerator cancels with one from the denominator, leaving (4 - r²).

So we have (-16) / [64 (4 - r²) ) ] = (-16)/(64 (4 - r²)) ) = (-1)/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, that gives K = (-1)/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, but that suggests that the Gaussian curvature varies with r. Hmm, but a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula for K. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't that of a pseudosphere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the Laplacian. Let me go back.

Wait, the Laplacian of ln(E) is the Laplacian of ln(32/(4−r²)).

Which is the same as the Laplacian of ln(32) - ln(4−r²).

The Laplacian of a constant is zero, so I only need to compute the Laplacian of -ln(4−r²).

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of f(r) is (1/r) d/dr [ r df/dr ].

So f(r) = -ln(4−r²). So df/dr = (-1/(4−r²)) * (-2 r) )= (2 r)/(4−r²).

Then, r df/dr = r*(2 r)/(4−r²) ) = 2 r²/(4−r²).

Now, d/dr [ 2 r²/(4−r²) ) ].

Using the quotient rule again:

numerator = 2 r² → d/dr =4 r.

denominator=4−r² → d/dr=−2r.

So derivative is [ (4 r)(4−r²) ) - (2 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4−r²)^2.

Compute numerator:

4 r (4 - r²) + 4 r³ = 16 r −4 r³ +4 r³=16 r.

So the derivative is (16 r)/(4−r²)^2.

Multiply by (1/r) from the Laplacian:

(1/r) * (16 r)/(4−r²)^2 ) =16/(4−r²)^2.

So Δ(ln E) = 16/(4−r²)^2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was negative. Oh, wait, because f(r)= −ln(4−r²), so the Laplacian is positive. Let me recheck.

Wait, f(r) = -ln(4 - r²). So df/dr = (2 r)/(4−r²).

Then, r df/dr = (2 r²)/(4−r²).

d/dr [r df/dr ] = [ 2*(2r)(4−r²) + 2 r²*(2 r) ] / (4−r²)^2 ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

Compute derivative of 2 r²/(4−r²):

d/dr [2 r²/(4−r²) ] = [4 r (4−r²) + 2 r² (2 r) ] / (4−r²)^2.

Wait, because numerator is 2r², denominator is 4 - r².

So using quotient rule: [ (4 r)(4 - r²) + (2 r²)(2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Expanding:

4r*(4 - r²) = 16 r −4 r^3.

2 r² * 2 r =4 r^3.

Total numerator: 16 r −4 r^3 +4 r^3=16 r.

So derivative is 16 r / (4−r²)^2.

So the Laplacian is (1/r) * (16 r)/(4−r²)^2 )=16/(4−r²)^2.

So Δ(ln E) =16/(4−r²)^2.

So now, K = ( -1/(2E) ) * Δ(ln E).

E is 32/(4−r²).

So 1/(2E) = (4−r²)/(64).

So K = (4−r²)/(64) ) * (16)/(4−r²)^2 )

Simplify:

(4 − r²) cancels one (4−r²) from denominator.

So K = (16) / (64 (4−r²)) ) ) = (1)/(4 (4−r²)).

So K = 1/(4 (4−r²)).

Hmm, so the curvature depends on r, which shouldn't be the case for a pseudosphere, which has constant curvature. So perhaps this isn't a pseudosphere's metric. Or maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, but the question states that this is a pseudosphere. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm not calculating the curvature correctly. Alternatively, perhaps this is not a pseudosphere but some other surface.

Wait, but regardless, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the metric's properties. The metric ds²= 32/(4−x²−y²) (dx² + dy²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric becomes singular. That suggests that the surface has a point at infinity or a cusp.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this metric describes a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane has negative curvature and infinite extent, its area is infinite. So the area would be infinite, which is option D.

Wait, but the question specifies a pseudosphere, which is a finite-area surface. Hmm. Or wait, maybe the pseudosphere as a surface of revolution is a finite-area, infinite-length curve. So perhaps in the context of this question, the area would be finite.

Wait, but the calculation earlier suggested that the area integral diverges, leading to an infinite area. So the area would be infinite.

So looking back at the options:

A) 0 → No, that doesn't make sense.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That seems to be a function, not a constant.

C) 4π(x² − y²) → Also a function, not a number.

D) +∞ → That would make sense if the integral diverges.

So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, where the conformal factor is \( E = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The region of definition for the metric is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must remain positive to ensure the metric is real. This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( (x, y) \)-plane.

To compute the area, the area element in a conformally flat metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = E \, dx \, dy.
\]

Thus, the area is:

\[
A = \int \int E \, dx \, dy = \int \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The limits of integration are \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \) and \( \theta = 0 \) to \( \theta = 2\pi \). The area integral is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), which corresponds to \( r \to 2 \). This indicates that the area integral diverges, and the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is a function of \( x \) and \( y \), not a constant.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is also a function of \( x \) and \( y \), not a constant.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Answer: D
