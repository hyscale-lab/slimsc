Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the question gives me phase shifts δ0 to δ4, each in degrees. The values are 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula involves the sum over all l of (2l +1) * e^{i δ_l} * (sin δ_l) / (something with the Legendre polynomials... right, the formula is something like f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] / (k r) * P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number and r is the distance. But wait, in this problem, we're looking along the incident beam direction. Oh right, when θ is 0 degrees, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l since that's a property of Legendre polynomials. So the scattering amplitude simplifies a lot in that direction.

So for θ=0, f(0) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (k r). But wait, the problem mentions to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. Oh, so we only consider l=0 to l=4. Because higher l's (like l=5 and beyond) are ignored.

Wait, but wait, the phase shift δl is given for l=0 to 4. So for each l, we have δl= values given. So l=0: δ0=90°, l=1: δ1=67°, l=2: δ2=55°, l=3: δ3=30°, l=4: δ4=13°. So we sum from l=0 to 4.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let me think about f(θ). The scattering amplitude f can be written as f = sum (2l+1) [ e^{iδl} sin δl ] P_l(cosθ) / (k r). But when θ=0, P_l(1) is 1. So f(0) is sum (2l+1) e^{iδl} sin δl / (k r).

But the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. Each term is (2l+1) [e^{iδl} sin δl ] / (k r). Let me compute each term's imaginary part.

Wait, e^{iδl} is cos δl + i sin δl. So when multiplied by sin δl, it becomes cos δl sin δl + i sin^2 δl.

So each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin^2 δl / (k r). Because the real part is (2l+1) * sin δl cos δl / (k r).

So the imaginary part of f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δl / (k r).

But wait, what is k? The wave number k is given by (2π/λ), where λ is the wavelength. But wait, the electrons have 50 MeV of energy. I think I need to compute k in terms of the electron's momentum.

The energy of an electron is given by E = (p^2)/(2m) + rest energy. Wait, electrons are relativistic here because 50 MeV is a significant fraction of their rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV). So we can't ignore relativistic effects.

But calculating k might get a bit involved. Let's think: The momentum p of the electron is sqrt(2mE), but wait, that's non-relativistic. Since E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass energy (0.511 MeV), relativistic effects are significant.

So the correct approach is to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Given E = 50 MeV, m c^2 = 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than m c^2, so we can approximate.

So solving for p: p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c.

Let me compute that. E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV. So E^2 is (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2. (m c^2)^2 is about 0.261 MeV^2. So E^2 is approximately 2500.0, so E^2 - (m c^2)^2 is approximately 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So p = sqrt(2499.739) / c ≈ sqrt(2500) is 50, but wait, sqrt(2499.739) is approximately 49.99739 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 49.99739 MeV/c.

But wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c). Oh, but I'm not sure about the units here. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, but perhaps it's better to compute it using actual units.

Wait, let me recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So if p is in MeV/c, then k is p / (ħ c) * (ħ c in MeV fm unit) ?

Wait, let me think: k = p / (ħ c) * (ħ c in units of MeV fm). Because 1/(ħ c) has units of fm^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute k in terms of 1/fm.

So p is approximately 49.99739 MeV/c. Then, k = p / (ħ c) = (49.99739 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = (49.99739) / (197.33) fm^{-1}.

Let me compute that: 49.99739 ≈ 50, so 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2538 fm^{-1}. So k ≈ 0.2538 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but the actual calculation:

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c ≈ sqrt(50² - (0.511)^2) / c ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / (ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50/(197.33) fm^{-1} ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Wait, more accurately:

50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2534.

So k ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Now, the term (k r) in the denominator comes from the scattering amplitude formula. Wait, but wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length (since it's a measure of cross-section, which is area per unit solid angle, but f is in units of length). So in the formula f(θ)= sum [ ... ] / (k r), so the denominator is k r. So (k r) must be dimensionless, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for f is f(θ) = (1/(2m)) sum ... but perhaps it's better to recall that in the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = ( (e^{2})/(4π ε0 k) ) * ... but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) / (k r), and when θ=0, it's sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (k r).

But wait, if r is the distance from which the scattering is observed, but in this problem, perhaps the amplitude is expressed per unit length, so r isn't part of the formula. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula for the scattering amplitude. From scattering theory, the partial-wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] / (2ik) P_l(cosθ), but wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [e^{2i δ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, that seems more precise. So, for the imaginary part, perhaps we can write:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [sin(2 δ_l)] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, because e^{2i δ_l} - 1 = e^{i 2 δ_l} -1 = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l) -1.

So the imaginary part would be (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l) / (2k) * P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention to calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So cosθ=1, and P_l(1) is 1 for all l.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, but wait, the given phase shifts are δo, δ1, etc., which are the δ_l's for each l.

So let's compute each term:

For each l, compute (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l) degrees, then sum and multiply by 1/(2k).

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So all higher l's beyond 4 are ignored.

Wait, but in the formula, the sum starts from l=0 to infinity, but we're only considering up to l=4. So for l=5 and beyond, their δ_l is considered zero, or not included.

So let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.

Compute (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l degrees) in radians.

Wait, sin function in calculations is in radians, so I need to convert degrees to radians.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute using degrees, but no, that's unlikely. So better convert degrees to radians.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses the small angle approximation, but I don't think so because the phase shifts are in the 90 to 13 degrees range.

So, for each l:

l=0:
δ0=90°, 2δ0=180°
sin(180°) = 0 → term is (1) * 0 = 0

l=1:
δ1=67°, 2δ1=134°
sin(134°) = sin(180-46) = sin(46°) ≈ 0.7193
(2*1+1)=3 → 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579

l=2:
δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°
sin(110) = sin(70) ≈ 0.9397
(2*2+1)=5 → 5 * 0.9397 ≈ 4.6985

l=3:
δ3=30°, 2δ3=60°
sin(60)=√3/2 ≈0.8660
(2*3+1)=7 →7*0.8660≈6.062

l=4:
δ4=13°, 2δ4=26°
sin(26)≈0.4384
(2*4+1)=9 →9 * 0.4384 ≈3.9456

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0
l=1: ~2.1579
l=2: ~4.6985
l=3: ~6.062
l=4: ~3.9456

Sum = 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = let's add them step by step.

2.1579 +4.6985 = 6.8564
6.8564 +6.062 = 12.9184
12.9184 +3.9456 =16.864

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Then, Im f(0) = sum/(2k) → sum is 16.864, 2k is 2*0.2534 ≈ 0.5068 fm⁻¹.

So Im f(0) = 16.864 / 0.5068 ≈ let's calculate that.

16.864 / 0.5068 ≈ approximately 33.27 fm.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Dividing 16.864 by 0.5068:

0.5068 ×33 =16.7244. 16.7244 is less than 16.864 by 0.1396.

0.1396 /0.5068 ≈ 0.275.

So total is 33.275. Approximately 33.27 fm.

But wait, the options don't have anything near 33. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, my calculation gives approx 33 fm, but none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part in the direction of the incident beam (θ=0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but perhaps I forgot a factor. Because in the formula, I thought that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k), but maybe that's not correct.

Wait, let me re-derive it. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ) / (k r).

Wait, no, earlier I thought the formula for f is f(θ)= sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) / (k r).

But actually, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, so f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

So the imaginary part is Im [ f(θ) ] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) Im [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Im [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] = Im [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1 ] = sin(2δ_l).

So Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, so that part was correct. So the sum is 16.864 as before, and 1/(2k) is 1/(2 * 0.2534) ≈ 1/(0.5068) ≈1.973 fm.

So 1.973 fm multiplied by 16.864 gives 1.973 *16.864 ≈ approximately 33.3 fm.

Hmm, but again, the options don't include 33.3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k. Let me recheck that.

The energy is E=50 MeV. The rest energy m c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So the total energy squared is E²= (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2. The rest energy squared is (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261.

So p² c² = E² - (m c²)^2 ≈2500 -0.261=2499.739 MeV².

p = sqrt(2499.739)/c ≈49.997 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / (ħ c).

What's ħ c in MeV fm units? ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 49.997/(197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct. So 1/(2k)= 1/(2 *0.2534) ≈1.973 fm.

Hmm, then 1.973 *16.864 ≈33.3 fm.

But the options don't have this number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift values. Let me recheck the given phase shifts.

The problem states δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13 degrees.

So for each l:

l=0: δ0=90°, 2δ0=180°, sin=0 → term=0.

l=1: δ1=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134)= sin(46)=approx 0.7193 → (2+1)=3, 3*0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2: δ2=55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)=sin(70°)=approx 0.9397 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.866 →7 *0.866≈6.062.

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ=26°, sin(26)≈0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Hmm, seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the formula uses δ_l instead of 2δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I should use sin δ_l instead of sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let's try that approach. If Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k).

So for each l:

l=0: 1 * sin(90) =1 → term=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.22495≈2.0246.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0246=13.3821.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.973 fm. So 13.3821 *1.973 ≈ let's compute.

13 *1.973=25.649.

0.3821 *1.973≈0.753.

Total≈25.649 +0.753≈26.402 fm.

Hmm, that's about 26.4 fm. Looking at the options, the closest is D) 251.271 fm, which is way larger. So not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, in the formula for f, the denominator is (2ik), so perhaps in the imaginary part, the denominator is (2k), but perhaps I forgot a factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the amplitude is given as (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}, and the formula for f is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me find a reference formula.

Upon checking, the scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part of f is then (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

So, in the initial approach, I think the formula is correct.

So the sum is 16.864, 1/(2k) is 1.973 fm.

16.864 *1.973 ≈33.3 fm.

Hmm, but options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula where the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Let me try that.

Sum for each l:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 sin(67)≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 sin(55)=5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9 sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum =1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Now, 13.382 divided by (2k)=0.5068 fm⁻¹.

So 13.382 /0.5068 ≈26.4 fm.

But the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k. Let me recompute k from the beginning.

E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

E² =50^2=2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c^2)^2=0.511^2≈0.2611 MeV^2.

So p² c²=2500 -0.2611=2499.7389 → p=√2499.7389 /c ≈49.997 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k = p/(ħ c) = (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = (49.997/197.33) fm⁻¹.

Compute 49.997/197.33: 197.33 ≈200, so 50/200=0.25. So 49.997/197.33≈0.2534.

So k≈0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

49.997 / 197.33 = let's compute.

197.33 * 0.25 =49.3325.

So 0.25 gives 49.3325. Since 49.997 is 0.6645 more than that.

So 0.6645 /197.33 ≈0.003367.

So k≈0.2534 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2 *0.2534)=1/0.5068≈1.973 fm.

Hmm, I think that's correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 33.3 fm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, not the imaginary part. No, the question clearly asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, maybe the formula uses sin δ_l, not sin 2δ_l.

Wait, let's try that. So, Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Sum is 13.382 as before.

13.382 *1.973 ≈26.4 fm. Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (2l+1) sin δ_l, but without the 2δ_l part. So perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k r), but earlier I thought the formula is with 2δ_l.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but that would be without the 1/(2k) factor.

Wait, let me think about units. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (fm), which would match if the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k).

Because each term has (2l+1) (dimensionless) * sin(2δ_l) (dimensionless) → so sum is dimensionless, then divided by (2k) (1/fm) → gives fm.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't have that value. So I must have missed something.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm. That's about 251 fm. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10^3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me think: k is in fm⁻¹.

Wait, the momentum p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p/(ħ c) → p in MeV/c, ħ c in MeV fm. So the units are (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) = 1/(c fm).

Wait, but c is in fm per second? No, let me think about the units properly.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s, but in natural units, c=1, but perhaps that's complicating. Alternatively, since we're using ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, the units are correct for k.

Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, so ħ c has units of energy * length, which is MeV fm.

So when you divide p (in MeV/c) by ħ c (MeV fm), you get (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) = 1/(c fm * c) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the units here. Let me think in terms of dimensional analysis.

p has units of MeV/c.

ħ c has units of MeV fm.

So k = p/(ħ c) → (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) = (1/c) / fm → but since c is in units of (fm/s?), perhaps I'm getting tangled up here. Maybe it's better to proceed with the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in terms of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers to see if that changes anything. But I think that's complicating things.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think again about the formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula for the total cross-section, which is ∑ (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l) / k, but that's for the total cross-section, not the amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude's imaginary part is given by (2l+1) sin δ_l, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude is f = (e^{2 i δ} -1 ) / (2ik) * something.

Wait, for l=0, the partial wave amplitude is (e^{2i δ0} -1 ) / (2ik), so the imaginary part would be [ sin(2 δ0) ]/(2k).

Similarly, for each l, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2 δl)/(2k).

Wait, but in that case, the sum would be sum (2l+1) sin(2 δl) / (2k).

So that's what I did earlier, leading to ~33 fm.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the imaginary parts of each partial wave, without being divided by 2k. That would make the sum 16.864, and if k is 0.2534, then 16.864 / 0.2534 ≈66.5 fm. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by k instead of dividing.

Wait, if I have 16.864 * k, with k=0.2534 fm⁻¹, that would be 16.864 * 0.2534 ≈4.276 fm⁻¹. No, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) divided by (k), not 2k.

So, for the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.382. Divided by k=0.2534 → 13.382 /0.2534 ≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recompute the sum using more precise sine values.

l=0: 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°). 134° in radians is (134 * π)/180 ≈2.34 radians. sin(2.34)= approximately 0.7193.

l=2:5 * sin(110°)=5 * 0.9396926=4.69846.

l=3:7 * sin(60°)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660254=6.062178.

l=4:9 * sin(26°). 26° in radians is ~0.4537 radians. sin(0.4537)=0.4383711.

9 *0.4383711=3.94534.

Sum is 0 +2.1579 +4.69846 +6.062178 +3.94534= let's add them:

2.1579 +4.69846=6.85636.

6.85636 +6.062178=12.918538.

12.918538 +3.94534=16.863878.

So the sum is approximately 16.863878.

Then, 16.863878/(2k)=16.863878/(2*0.2534)=16.863878/0.5068≈33.3 fm.

Hmm. So the correct answer according to my calculation is about 33.3 fm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the scattering amplitude without the 1/(2k) factor, i.e., f = sum (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

Wait, the formula I'm using is f(θ) = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) / (k r).

But I'm not considering r. Wait, in scattering experiments, perhaps the amplitude is normalized per unit length, so r is taken as 1. Or perhaps the formula in the problem doesn't include r, making the denominator just k.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) / (2k).

In that case, the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) / (2k).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), then multiply by 1/(2k).

So, given that, 33.3 fm is the result, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute it more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (mc^2)^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV, mc^2=0.511 MeV.

p² c² =50² -0.511² =2500 - 0.261121=2499.738879.

p= sqrt(2499.738879) MeV/c ≈49.997388 MeV/c.

k =p/(ħ c) =49.997388 MeV/c /197.33 MeV fm.

So 49.997388 /197.33 = let's compute.

197.33 *0.25 =49.3325.

49.997388 -49.3325=0.664888.

0.664888 /197.33 ≈0.003367.

So k=0.25 +0.003367=0.253367 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2*0.253367)=1/0.506734≈1.9732 fm.

Now, sum is 16.863878.

16.863878 * 1.9732 ≈33.29 fm.

Hmm, still the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c. I used 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps the exact value is different.

The value of ħ c is approximately 197.327 MeV fm. So using 197.327, perhaps the calculation would change slightly.

So p=49.997388 MeV/c.

k=49.997388 /197.327 ≈0.25336 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sum was miscalculated. Let me recompute the sum using more precise sine values.

l=0: 0.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°. sin(134°)=sin(46°)=0.7193398.

3 *0.7193398=2.1580194.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)=sin(70°)=0.9396926.

5 *0.9396926=4.698463.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°, sin=√3/2=0.8660254.

7 *0.8660254=6.0621778.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°, sin(26)=0.4383711.

9 *0.4383711=3.9453399.

Sum:

2.1580194 +4.698463=6.8564824.

6.8564824 +6.0621778=12.9186602.

12.9186602 +3.9453399=16.8640001.

So sum is 16.8640001.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9732 fm.

16.864 *1.9732 ≈33.29 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum without the (2l+1) terms. That would be sum sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to4.

But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the real part instead. But the question is clear about the imaginary part.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in the initial formula. Another possibility is that the formula uses sin(δ_l) without the 2.

Wait, if we compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, then:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.920504=2.761512.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.819152≈4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Sum:1 +2.761512=3.761512 +4.09576=7.857272 +3.5=11.357272 +2.02456=13.381832.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9732 fm.

13.381832 *1.9732 ≈26.4 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the impact of the target's properties, but the problem doesn't mention any other factors, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: perhaps the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin δ_l, summed over all l, without any division.

Sum is 13.381832.

But that would give 13.381832 fm, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Another thought: Maybe the formula involves the scattering length, which is the l=0 term.

Wait, the scattering length a is given by a= (1/k) cot δ0. But in our case, δ0=90°, so cot 90=0 → a=0.

But that's a side note; perhaps it's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by f= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k).

Which would be 13.381832 * (1/0.25336)=13.381832 /0.25336≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different expression. Maybe the amplitude is f= sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

But then, the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, let's compute that.

l=0: 1 * sin²(90)=1 → term=1.

l=1:3 * sin²(67)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55)=5*(0.81915)^2=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Multiply by 1/k=1/0.25336≈3.947 fm.

9.1023 *3.947≈35.94 fm.

Still not matching any of the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. None of the approaches I've tried match the given options. But perhaps I'm missing a crucial point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the total scattering cross-section, which is ∑ (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l) /k.

But the question is about the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section. But let's compute that just in case.

For each l:

l=0: (1)(1 - cos90)=1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos67°)=3*(1-0.3907)=3*(0.6093)=1.8279.

l=2:5*(1 - cos55)=5*(1-0.5736)=5*0.4264=2.132.

l=3:7*(1 - cos30)=7*(1-0.8660)=7*0.134≈0.938.

l=4:9*(1 - cos13)=9*(1-0.9744)=9*0.0256≈0.2304.

Sum:1 +1.8279=2.8279 +2.132=4.9599 +0.938=5.8979 +0.2304≈6.1283.

Cross-section would be 6.1283/k =6.1283/0.25336≈24.2 fm².

But this isn't relevant to the problem, which asks for the imaginary part of the amplitude.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the sum of the imaginary parts without dividing by 2k, leading to 16.864, which is approximately 16.864 *1.973 ≈33.29 fm.

But again, no options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for k. Let me think: when E=50 MeV, what's k?

Alternative approach: Use relativistic energy-momentum relation correctly.

E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV, mc²=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) / c = sqrt(2500 - 0.261) /c ≈49.997388 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ c) = (49.997388 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = (49.997388)/(197.33) fm⁻¹≈0.25336 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a non-relativistic approach? Let's try that.

Non-relativistic: E= p²/(2m).

So p = sqrt(2mE).

m is the electron mass, which is about 0.511 MeV/c².

E=50 MeV.

So p= sqrt(2 *0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV) = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k=p/(ħ c)=7.15/(197.33)≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

But that would make 1/(2k)=1/(2*0.0362)=14.36 fm.

Now, sum for 2δ_l approach:16.864 → 16.864 *14.36≈242 fm.

Hmm, that's closer to option B (355) or D (251), but not quite.

Alternatively, sum for sin δ_l approach:13.382 *14.36≈192 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but the given options are in the hundreds. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is in units of inverse meters, not femtometers. 1 fm =1e-15 m. But that would make the numbers even larger, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything in natural units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so k is in inverse fm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin 2δ_l.

Which would give sum=13.382, then 13.382 * (1/(2k))=13.382 *1.973≈26.4 fm.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c. For example, 197.33 MeV fm is correct, but perhaps the problem uses 197.33 MeV * 1e-15 m, but that's the same as fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use (2l+1) * tan δ_l instead of sin δ_l or sin(2 δ_l). Let me try that.

tan δ_l for each l:

l=0: tan90→infinite, but since δ0=90°, tan90 is ∞, which would make the term infinite. That can't be right. So l=0 term is problematic. But in reality, for δ=90°, sin δ=1, so perhaps that's handled differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses e^{i δ_l} -1, which would have Im part sin δ_l.

But no, that would lead to the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given the time I've spent and the calculations, the correct answer according to my calculations is approximately 33.3 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is f= (sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / (k r), and the problem ignores all terms except for the first few. But even so, I don't see a way to get to the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the differential cross-section instead of the amplitude. The differential cross-section is |f(θ)|², but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of f.

Hmm.

Another possibility: maybe the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/k), not (1/(2k)).

In that case, sum is 13.382, 1/k=1/0.25336≈3.947 fm⁻¹.

13.382 *3.947≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, but without the denominator, leading to 13.382 fm, which is not an option.

I'm stuck. Given that, I'll have to pick the closest option, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is roughly half of 355.351.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum more accurately.

Wait, sum for 2δ_l:

l=0: 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134)=3*0.7193398=2.1580194.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.9396926=4.698463.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*0.8660254=6.0621778.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4383711=3.9453399.

Sum: 2.1580194 +4.698463 =6.8564824 +6.0621778 =12.9186602 +3.9453399=16.8640001.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9732 →16.864 *1.9732 ≈33.29 fm.

Again, no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) * (1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k).

But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the sum without the (2l+1) factors, but that would give a sum of sin(2δ_l), which is:

l=0:0.

l=1: sin(134)=0.7193 →0.7193.

l=2: sin(110)=0.9397 →0.9397.

l=3: sin(60)=0.866 →0.866.

l=4: sin(26)=0.4384 →0.4384.

Sum=0 +0.7193 +0.9397 +0.866 +0.4384=2.9634.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9732 →2.9634 *1.9732≈5.86 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer according to my calculations is approximately 33.3 fm, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately twice 88.837, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option C, which is approximately 177.675 fm. If my calculation of 33.3 fm is correct, but the option is about half of that, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2 times the sum, leading to 66.5 fm. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that is approximately 33.3 multiplied by 5.333, which would be 177.675, which is option C.

Hmm, but I don't see a reason for that factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for ħ c. Let me check: ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm, yes. But perhaps the exact value is 197.327, which would change k slightly.

But even with that, the change is minimal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f= sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, and the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which would be:

l=0:1*(1)^2=1.

l=1:3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5*(0.81915)^2=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Multiply by 1/k=3.947.

9.1023 *3.947≈35.94 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, but I can't see how to get there from my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately twice 177.675.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert MeV to eV in the calculation of p.

Wait, no, because all values are in MeV, so units should cancel out correctly.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be around 33.3 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.333 times 33.3 fm. But I can't think of a reason for that factor.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the sum in terms of sin δ_l instead of sin(2δ_l), leading to sum=13.382, and 13.382 * (1/k)=13.382 *3.947≈52.8 fm. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm. Let me see if 251.271 divided by 33.3 gives me a familiar factor. 251.271 /33.3≈7.546, which is approximately 2π/ (something), but not a clear factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 33.3 * 5.333. So perhaps the formula I should have used is sum (2l+1) * (1 - cos δ_l), but that doesn't lead to that number.

Hmm, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Since my calculation leads to 33.3, which is not an option, and the closest option in terms of being a multiple is option C) 177.675, which is about 5.33 times 33.3, perhaps that's the intended answer.

But without a clear reason, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/k).

So sum=13.382, 1/k=3.947 fm⁻¹.

13.382 *3.947≈52.8 fm.

No, that's not option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k).

Which would be 16.864 *3.947≈66.5 fm.

Still, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, as it is approximately the sum 16.864 multiplied by 10.58, but I don't have a reason for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the sum with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the scattering length, which is a= (1/k) cot δ0.

But δ0=90°, cot 90=0, so a=0.

But that's not directly helpful.

In conclusion, I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't include the correct answer. However, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, though I can't see how it would be derived.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic electron scattering, given the phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of partial waves, and the imaginary part is derived using the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated as $k = \frac{p}{\hbar c}$, with $p$ derived from the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ and $mc^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$, $p \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV/c}$, and $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$. Thus, $k \approx 0.2534 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$.

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude involves summing over the contributions from $l = 0$ to $l = 4$:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

For each $l$:
- $l=0$: $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0$, contribution = $0$.
- $l=1$: $\sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193$, contribution = $3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579$.
- $l=2$: $\sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397$, contribution = $5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985$.
- $l=3$: $\sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660$, contribution = $7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.0620$.
- $l=4$: $\sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384$, contribution = $9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456$.

Summing these contributions gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.0620 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
\]

Substituting into the formula for $\text{Im } f(0)$:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{16.864}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.2534} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.5068} \approx 33.3 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. A detailed re-evaluation of the formula, including alternative interpretations of the phase shifts and potential missing factors, was conducted. However, none of the adjustments yielded a value consistent with the options. The closest option, based on the possibility of a missing factor or misinterpretation, is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately five times the calculated value. Despite the discrepancy, this is the most plausible choice among the given options.

Answer: C
