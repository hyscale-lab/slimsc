Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various power laws, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So if distance is r, then plx is 1/r. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, right? And the formula I remember is distance in parsecs (d) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (d = 1/plx). So if plx is small, the distance is large, which makes sense.

So the given relationship is number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r (since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d = 1/r if r is in parsecs), substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Let me compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait a second. Let's double-check that.

Wait, if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx^5 = (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. So, as distance increases, the number of stars per unit volume increases as r^5? Hmm, that seems high. Wait, but wait, the question says how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. So for each unit increase in r, N increases by a factor of r^5. So if r increases, the number of stars in a region increases as r^5.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because as you go further away, the density of stars should decrease, right? Because each star would appear fainter and cover a larger area. Wait, but wait, the question is about the number of stars, not their brightness. So if you're looking at a certain region of the sky, how many stars are there as a function of distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a specific volume. Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, the number of stars in that region varies as 1/plx^5. So as parallax decreases (because r increases), the number of stars increases. Because plx is smaller, so 1/plx^5 becomes larger. So more stars when plx is small, which is when r is large.

So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars per unit distance (per unit r) would be proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because as r increases, the number of stars should probably increase but maybe not so steeply. But according to the math, it's N ∝ r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So that's the answer. But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think about the relationship between distance and the number of stars. If the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, and volume is r^3, but that's in a uniform distribution. But here, the given relationship is different.

Wait, the given is that N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

So for a given region, if you go to a larger distance, you're seeing more stars. That's because when you look further, you're covering a larger volume, but maybe in this specific case, it's varying as r^5. So per unit r, the number is increasing as r^5. So the correct answer would be option B: ~ r^5.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this relationship into the given proportionality, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This means the number of stars in the region increases with distance as \( r^5 \). Among the provided options, the correct choice is \( \sim r^5 \).

Answer: B
