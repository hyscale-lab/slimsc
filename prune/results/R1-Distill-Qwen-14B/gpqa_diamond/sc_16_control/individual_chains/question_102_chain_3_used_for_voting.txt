Okay, so I have this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So the setup is that someone has identified a new ligand and receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to see what happens when these two proteins interact during development. 

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular (so probably two in the membrane?), and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand and the receptor are both in the same vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. I remember that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can enable the translation of the second gene in a bicistronic mRNA. So initially, the mRNA would be translated for the ligand, then the IRES allows ribosomes to translate the receptor.

Now, the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I think loxP sites are used for recombination with Cre. So if Cre is present, it would recombine and remove the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed. 

So, when the vector is transfected into cells, without Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed because the stop is before mCherry. But the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed because the stop cassette is in between. But wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor's ORF. Wait, no, the vector is ligand (CBA promoter) with loxP-stop-loxP and mCherry, then the IRES, followed by receptor and eGFP with another stop cassette. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the vector is constructed as: CBA promoter drives the ligand. After ligand, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Then mCherry. Then, IRES, followed by receptor, then another stop cassette with lox2272, and eGFP. 

So without Cre, the stop cassettes block expression beyond them. So ligand would be expressed because the promoter is before it. The mCherry is after the stop, so it wouldn't be expressed unless the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be blocked by the second stop. 

But when Cre is introduced (like in a Cre-expressing cell or mouse), the Cre would recombine the lox sites. For the first cassette (loxP), Cre would excise it, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a fusion, perhaps. And for the second cassette (lox2272), Cre would excise that, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a fusion. 

But wait, the construct is used in primary astrocyte culture. So maybe they transfected the vector into astrocytes, which don't normally express Cre. So in that case, the stops would remain, and only the ligand would be expressed, but perhaps not the receptor or eGFP. But wait, the question says that they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wt background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. 

SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre mice would express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, so Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like the cells where the receptor and ligand are normally expressed. 

So when they breed their mouse model, which has the bicistronic vector, with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre will excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the ligand (with mCherry) and the receptor (with eGFP) should be expressed. 

Then, they visualize the offspring under a confocal microscope. They expected to see eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. But they don't see a green signal. So why isn't the eGFP being expressed or detected? 

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct seems to be for coexpression in the same cell, so if they're in the same cell, then they shouldn't be paracrine. But maybe this doesn't affect the expression of the GFP. So maybe this isn't the issue.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so the antibody might not detect it in the Western blot. Wait, but the question says they did a Western blot after transfection and saw signals proportional to actin. So perhaps the expression is detected, but in the mouse, maybe the GFP isn't being expressed. Because the Western blot would check for the protein levels, but in the mouse, they're using fluorescence. Hmm, perhaps the issue is in the expression in the mouse.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocyte culture. So in that case, the cells would not have Cre (since they're not the SOX10-Cre mice), so the stops would be in place. The ligand would be expressed (since the stop is after it, but in the vector, the ligand is upstream; wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the stop is after the ligand. So without Cre, the mCherry would be behind the stop; so the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry wouldn't. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would have a stop before them, so they wouldn't be expressed. So when they do the Western blot, perhaps only the ligand is expressed. But the question states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they would have antibodies against ligand and receptor, I suppose. 

Wait, but in the mouse, when the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), the stops should be removed, allowing both the ligand (with mCherry) and the receptor (with eGFP) to be expressed. So in the mouse, the neural crest cells should express both. But in the confocal, they didn't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. 

Looking at the options again:

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. That would cause a frameshift, making a nonfunctional protein. But if the construct has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP in frame, then Cre would excise the stop and allow them to be expressed together. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed, so the Western blot might not show the receptor either, because the ORF would be messed up. But if the frame is wrong, the antibody against the receptor might not detect anything, but in the initial Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin. Maybe the ligand was expressed but not the receptor in the transfected cells. But in the mouse, perhaps the frame is correct, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because of a stop codon in the frame. 

Alternatively, the IRES element after the ligand might not be working correctly. But the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so it's likely that the ligand is correctly expressed. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the mRNA would be translated for the ligand, then the IRES would allow the ribosome to translate the receptor. 

Another possibility: the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 site isn't recombining. Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different sites recognized by Cre. So in the vector, the first stop is between ligand and mCherry, using loxP. The second stop is between receptor and eGFP, using lox2272. Cre would have to recombine both sites. So when Cre is active (like in the SOX10-Cre mouse's neural crest cells), the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, as well as the receptor and eGFP. 

But if the lox2272 site isn't recombining, then the stop remains, and the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. So why wouldn't the lox2272 sites recombine? Well, perhaps the Cre used isn't specific for lox2272. Or perhaps the vector uses a different Cre variant. Wait, the first stop is loxP, and the second is lox2272. I believe that Cre can recombine both, but perhaps the strain of Cre (like SOX10-Cre) uses a Cre that can't recognize lox2272. Or perhaps the vector's lox sites are arranged incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the construct was designed such that the lox2272 is in a way that Cre can't open it. 

Wait, lox2272 is a variant that's only recognized by Cre in the presence of certain conditions, like in the presence of certain mutations or when the Cre is a specific variant. Or perhaps the vector has lox sites in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox2272 is in the same orientation as loxP, then Cre would excise the stop. But if it's in the reverse, then maybe it doesn't. Alternatively, perhaps the construct doesn't allow for the correct excision, leaving the stop in place. 

So if the lox2272 isn't excised, then the stop remains between receptor and eGFP. So the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. But wait, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the stop is in between, the receptor would be expressed as a truncated protein without eGFP. But would the receptor be expressed at all? Because the stop is after the receptor ORF. Wait, no, the stop is after the receptor. So the ORF is receptor followed by stop, then eGFP. So without the stop being removed, the receptor would be expressed (since it's before the stop), but the eGFP wouldn't. 

Wait, no, in the construct, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor's coding sequence is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the stop isn't removed, then the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, and the eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, if the receptor is expressed, the antibody would detect it. But in the mouse, in the live tissue, they look for eGFP fluorescence. If the stop isn't removed, then eGFP isn't expressed, so no fluorescence. But why wouldn't the stop be removed? Because perhaps the Cre isn't able to recombine the lox2272 site. 

Wait, the SOX10-Cre is a common Cre line, which I believe uses ordinary Cre, so it should recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites. But maybe the vector has multiple lox sites, and something went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites were in the same orientation, causing the gene to be excised instead of allowing the expression. 

Another option is that perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, leading to a premature stop codon, so the protein isn't expressed. So option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be correctly translated, leading to no expression. But if the frame is wrong, the receptor would also be messed up. So in the Western blot, would the antibody against the receptor detect anything? If the frame is wrong, the receptor might not be expressed correctly, and the antibody (which is against the overexpressed protein) wouldn't detect it. But the question says that after transfection, the Western blot gives signals proportional to actin. So perhaps the ligand and receptor were expressed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the frame is wrong. But if the frame is wrong, the Western blot might not show the receptor either. 

Alternatively, perhaps the expression isn't happening because the promoter is missing. Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. So the promoter is present. So that's probably not the issue. 

Another possibility is that the vector is set up so that the receptor isn't expressed in the same cell as the ligand. But the question says they are in a bicistronic vector, so they should be co-expressed. 

Wait, the question states that the ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So the mRNA is polyadenylated after the receptor. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed because the stop is after it. The stop before the receptor prevents its expression. With Cre, the stops are removed, so both ligand and receptor are expressed. 

But in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the offspring should have Cre in the neural crest cells. So the stops are removed, and both ligand and receptor should be expressed. But the eGFP isn't showing up. 

Another angle: maybe the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But IRES is supposed to drive translation of the second gene. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't because the IRES isn't working. But would the Western blot show the receptor? No, because without the IRES working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed in the presence of Cre. But in the initial Western blot after transfection, which didn't have Cre, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But the question says that in the Western blot, they saw a signal proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins were expressed. Hmm, perhaps the Western blot was done under conditions where both were expressed, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP construct is faulty. Like, the eGFP isn't correctly inserted, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed. But the question states that the vector is designed correctly. 

Wait, the original setup: the vector is a bicistronic construct where ligand is first, followed by mCherry with a loxP stop, then IRES, then receptor, then another stop with lox2272, then eGFP. So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites are recombined, removing the stops. So ligand and mCherry are expressed as a fusion, and receptor and eGFP as a fusion. 

In the mouse, SOX10-Cre would cause Cre to be expressed in neural crest cells, leading to the excision of both stops. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed, with mCherry and eGFP as tags. 

But in the confocal, they don't see eGFP. So why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent the eGFP from being expressed, but would the receptor be expressed correctly? If the ORF is not in frame, the receptor's coding sequence might be messed up. So the antibody against the receptor (from the Western blot) would not detect it. But the question says that the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin. So perhaps the Western blot showed the ligand but not the receptor. But the question doesn't specify which protein was detected. 

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly translated because the frame is wrong. But the question is about why no green signal is observed. 

Another thought: the eGFP is on the C-terminus of the receptor. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, perhaps the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface, so it's not fluorescent. But the question states that the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein, which should be expressed on the cell surface. 

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the vector's design doesn't allow it. For example, the presence of multiple stop codons or incorrect reading frames. 

Wait, the stop cassettes have loxP and lox2272. If the Cre doesn't recognize the lox2272 correctly, the stop remains. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, the receptor would be detected (if the antibody is against it), but in the confocal, no eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot after transfection shows signals proportional to actin. So maybe the actin loading control is correct, and the blot shows the presence of the proteins. 

But if the eGFP isn't expressed, then the confocal wouldn't show green. So why isn't eGFP expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. 

Why wouldn't the stop be removed? Because the Cre isn't working, or because the lox sites aren't correctly recognized. Alternatively, maybe the vector wasn't properly integrated, leading to the construct not being present. But the mice are homozygous for the construct, which suggests the construct is present. 

Wait, another angle: the vector could be in a location where Cre isn't active. But the SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in neural crest cells, which are where the receptor and ligand are expressed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly spliced. But the question doesn't give any info about splicing. 

Another possibility: the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But IRES is supposed to drive the translation of the second gene. If it's not functional, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But then the Western blot would also not show the receptor. 

Wait, in the initial Western blot, after transfection, the signal is proportional to actin. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are expressed. But in the mouse, they are crossed with SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in the neural crest cells, leading to the expression of the eGFP. 

But the question states that in the mouse, they don't see eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why? Let's think about the fusion. The receptor is fused to eGFP. So the construct is receptor-eGFP. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the Western blot may show the receptor, but the eGFP isn't present. 

But the question says that the Western blot after transfection shows a signal proportional to actin. Which likely indicates that the proteins are expressed. 

Wait, perhaps the frame is correct, but when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. So the fusion is correct. But if the eGFP is not properly expressed, perhaps the gene is not correctly ligated. 

Alternatively, the enhancer for the promoter is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, not necessarily an enhancer. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So if the CBA promoter isn't active, the ligand wouldn't be expressed. But in the mouse, perhaps the CBA promoter is active, leading to ligand expression, but the receptor isn't. 

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not drive expression. But CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe enhancer isn't a big issue. 

Alternatively, perhaps the expression cassettes are in the wrong orientation. For example, the CBA promoter is driving the ligand, but the IRES is in the wrong orientation to drive the receptor. But the question says the IRES is upstream of the receptor, which is correct. 

Another angle: the presence of the mCherry and eGFP may cause some issues. Maybe the cells are dying due to overexpression, but the question doesn't suggest that. 

Wait, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. IRES elements require specific conditions, like a certain mRNA structure, to work. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed, even if the stop is removed. So in the mouse, the ligand would be expressed (because CBA is a strong promoter), but the receptor wouldn't, due to the IRES failure. 

In that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal. But the Western blot would show the ligand, but not the receptor. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin, which probably refers to the presence of the proteins. 

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is working, but the lox2272 site isn't being recombined. So the stop remains between receptor and eGFP. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. 

If the lox2272 isn't recombined, then eGFP isn't expressed. So the confocal doesn't show green. But why? Because the stop isn't removed. 

Wait, Cre's ability to recombine lox2272. I think that standard Cre can recombine both loxP and lox2272 sites. So the problem must be elsewhere. 

Another possibility: the vector is designed with the loxP and lox2272 in a way that when Cre is present, the eGFP is excised instead of expressed. For example, if the vector is arranged such that Cre recombination deletes the eGFP. But that's a more complicated scenario. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed in a way that the eGFP is not part of the expression cassette, but instead is a separate selection marker. But the question says that the receptor is fused to eGFP. 

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed in reverse. Let me re-examine the vector's structure. 

The vector is bicistronic, so the two ORFs are in the same mRNA. The 5' ORF is ligand, followed by mCherry with a loxP-stop. Then the IRES, then receptor, then eGFP with a lox2272-stop. 

In the absence of Cre, the mRNA would have ligand (expressed), then the stop before mCherry, so mCherry isn't expressed. The IRES would allow translation of the receptor, but the stop before eGFP would prevent its expression. 

When Cre is present, it recombines loxP and lox2272, removing the stops. So ligand and mCherry are expressed as a fusion, and receptor and eGFP as a fusion. 

But in the mouse, when Cre is active, the stops are removed. So both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed. 

If in the confocal, only mCherry is expressed, but not eGFP, perhaps the lox2272 wasn't recombined. But the mouse's Cre should do that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that eGFP is not being expressed because of incorrect frame. So when the lox2272 is recombined, the eGFP is in frame. But if the frame is wrong, then eGFP is not expressed, leading to no green signal. 

So looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent the eGFP from being expressed, leading to no signal. But why would the frame be incorrect? Because during the vector construction, the eGFP's ORF wasn't correctly placed after the receptor's. So after Cre excises the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be in the same frame, but if the frame is wrong, then the eGFP isn't expressed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a stop codon in the frame, preventing eGFP expression. 

So the most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to co-express a ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is controlled by an IRES element. The vector includes stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites, which are excised by Cre to allow co-expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins. After breeding mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice, no green fluorescence from eGFP is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the vector is designed for co-expression in the same cell, and paracrine interaction does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, the Western blot after transfection showed signals proportional to actin, indicating that the proteins were expressed. This suggests that the issue is not with trafficking but rather with expression of eGFP. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which should drive its expression. The receptor is controlled by an IRES, which does not require additional enhancers. There is no evidence in the question to suggest that the enhancer is missing or non-functional. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be correctly translated, leading to no fluorescence. This could occur if the vector was constructed incorrectly, placing eGFP out of frame with the receptor. This explanation aligns with the observation of no green signal in the confocal microscopy, as eGFP would not be expressed. This is the most likely reason for the lack of fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing the expression of eGFP and resulting in no green fluorescence under confocal microscopy.
