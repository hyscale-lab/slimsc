Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. They found one planet each, both Neptune-mass. The planets are in circular orbits. Using the RV method, which I remember stands for radial velocity. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

So, for planet #1, the spectral line has a periodic shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Hmm. The RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's mass and orbital period. I remember that the formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the star's motion caused by the planet.

The formula I think is something like K = (V) = (G * (M_p) / (M_star * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3))) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 AU)^(1/3) ) * (1 year) * (sin i), but maybe I'm getting some terms mixed up. Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the radial velocity and the orbital period.

Another approach: the RV method tells us that the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * (some function of the orbit's inclination, but since both are similar, maybe inclination is the same or can be considered the same). Wait, maybe it's K = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) ) ) * something... I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps a better way: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) )) ) * (sin i) / (1 AU)^(1/3) ), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), assuming that M_p is much smaller than M_star, which is the case here since both planets are Neptune mass and stars are sun-like.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the star's velocity would depend on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. So, if M_p is much less than M_star (which it is, Neptune is much less than Sun), then M_p + M_star ≈ M_star, so M_p/M_star is a small number. So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ).

So, K ∝ (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But in this problem, the two stars are identical, M_star is same for both, and the planets have the same mass as Neptune, so M_p is same for both. So M_p / M_star is same for both. So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). Because the other factors are the same.

Wait, but in the question, K is different between the two planets. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 is 7. So K_2 is larger than K_1 by a factor of 7/5.

But since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K_2/K_1 = (1/P_2^(1/3)) / (1/P_1^(1/3)) ) = (P_1 / P_2)^(1/3).

Wait, more precisely, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K_2 / K_1 = (1/P_2^(1/3)) ) / (1/P_1^(1/3)) ) = (P_1 / P_2)^(1/3).

Wait, let me rephrase: K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), because K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

So, K_2 / K_1 = 7/5. And according to the proportionality, K_2/K_1 = (P_1 / P_2)^(1/3).

So, let's set up the equation:

(7/5) = (P_1 / P_2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = P_1 / P_2

Hmm, 7/5 is 1.4, so 1.4^3 is about 2.744. So (7/5)^3 = 343 / 125 = approx 2.744.

So, 2.744 = P_1 / P_2 → P_2 = P_1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364 * P_1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So P_2 is longer than P_1 by a factor of (P_2 / P_1).

Wait wait, no. If I rearrange the equation, P_2 is (P_1 * 5^3)/(7^3) )^ (1/3) ?

Wait, wait, let me think again. The equation is (7/5) = (P_1/P_2)^(1/3).

Wait, let me take the two Ks. K_2 is 7, K_1 is5. So K_2/K_1 =7/5.

Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then (K_2)/(K_1) = (1/P_2^(1/3)) / (1/P_1^(1/3)) ) = (P_1 / P_2)^(1/3) =7/5.

So (P_1 / P_2)^(1/3) =7/5 → (P_1/P_2) = (7/5)^3 → 343/125 → approx 2.744.

So P_1 = 2.744 * P_2 → P_2 = P_1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364 * P_1.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. That would mean planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

Wait, no. Because if P_2 is shorter, then P_2 = 0.364 * P_1 → P_2 / P_1 = 0.364 → so the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So #2's period is shorter.

But the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?

Wait, that would be (P_2 / P_1). If P_2 is 0.364 * P_1, then P_2 / P_1 =0.364, so about 0.36 times longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So that's the answer.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3) ) )

But K is also proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), because:

K ∝ ( (M_p) / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the exponents. Let me think in terms of proportionality.

K ∝ (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Because M_p is same for both planets, and M_star same, then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So if K_2 =7 and K_1=5, (since K_2 > K_1), then 1/P_2^(1/3) > 1/P_1^(1/3) → P_2^(1/3) < P_1^(1/3) → P_2 < P_1.

So the ratio of periods is P_2 / P_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3.

Because K_2 = (1/P_2^(1/3)) * const → P_2 = (const / K_2)^3.

Similarly, P_1 = (const / K_1)^3.

So P_2 / P_1 = (K_1^3) / (K_2^3) ) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2 has a shorter orbital period. But the question is how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. So it's shorter, so the factor is ~0.36 times.

So the answer is option A, ~0.36.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Using the RV method, the semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets are similar in mass, the proportionality simplifies to \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \).

For planet #1, the RV semi-amplitude is \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for planet #2, it is \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}.
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods is related to the ratio of the semi-amplitudes by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
