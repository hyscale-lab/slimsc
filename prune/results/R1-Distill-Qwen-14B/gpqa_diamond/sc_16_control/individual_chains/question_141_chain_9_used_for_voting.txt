Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions or elimination reactions, especially in the context of aromatic substitution.

Wait, wait. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, no, wait. I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? No, wait, the 'd' might refer to something else. Oh, wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is 1-bromobenzene-2-d; perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in positions 1 and 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromobenzene with a methyl group in the para position? Wait, no, wait—no, the numbering. If it's 1-bromo, then the substituents are at position 1. But 2-d? Hmm, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps the 'd' is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is bromobenzene with methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. That makes sense because then the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, no, let me get this clear. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the benzene ring has bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. That would give a structure where the substituents are at positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). Wait, no, 2 and 4 are adjacent to position 1. So the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to the Br.

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with Br at position 1. Then, the '2-d' part—I'm not sure. Maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl, so substituents are at positions 2 and 4. So positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). So the structure would be Br at position 1, methyl at position 2 (ortho to Br), and methyl at position 4 (para to Br). But wait, benzene is symmetric, so positions 2 and 4 are adjacent and opposite relative to Br.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Let's number the benzene ring. Position 1 is Br. Then, positions 2 and 4 would be the next positions in the ring. So, if the substituents are at 2 and 4, the structure would have a methyl group at 2 (next to Br) and another methyl at 4, which is across from position 2 but adjacent to position 3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, making a para substitution relative to each other? No, wait, position 2 and 4 are meta to each other, not para. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6—so 1 is next to 2 and 6. 2 is next to 1 and 3. 4 is next to 3 and 5. So 2 and 4 are across from each other in a way, but they are two positions apart. So they are meta to each other.

So the structure would have Br at 1, methyl at 2, and methyl at 4. Now, when this is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. I remember that NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation, especially for forming rings, like when you have a benzyl halide and you eliminate to form a triple bond, but here it's an aromatic substitution.

Wait, but wait. 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. I think this is a case where the bromide is in a position that could undergo elimination if possible, but in aromatic substitution, perhaps it's more about nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, no, NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate things. Alternatively, in aromatic substitution, especially for more reactive rings, like when activating groups are present, the base can act as a base or perhaps facilitate elimination.

Wait, another possibility is that NaNH2 in ammonia is a condition for the formation of an aromatic ring via elimination, perhaps in a di-substituted case. Or perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, but that's usually for aliphatic compounds.

Wait, wait, let me recall. When a benzene ring has two substituents, and one is a leaving group (like Br), and perhaps other groups that can act as electron-donating or withdrawing.

In this case, the substituents are methyl groups in positions 2 and 4 relative to the Br. Methyl groups are activating, electron-donating by the +I effect. So when Br is attached to benzene, and there are activating groups nearby, perhaps the Br can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps deprotonating something. Alternatively, in a strongly basic solution, perhaps elimination occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond or some other ring structure. Wait, but benzene isn't going to form a triple bond. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. If the ring is activated, then perhaps the Br can be replaced by something. But the solvent is condensed ammonia, which might not have a good leaving group for that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a case of elimination to form a benzene ring with a nitrene or something else, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the conditions again. NaNH2 is a strong base, used in conditions like the Birch reduction, but more commonly in dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, in the presence of a good leaving group, perhaps an elimination occurs.

Wait, but in aromatic systems, elimination reactions are less common than substitution. However, with activating groups, perhaps a substitution is possible.

Wait, let me think about this. The compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the ring has Br at position 1 and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So the substituents are in positions ortho and para to the Br.

In such a case, perhaps the Br is in a position where it can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But wait, nucleophilic aromatic substitution usually occurs when the ring is activated towards nucleophilic attack, which requires electron-withdrawing groups. But methyl groups are electron-donating, which would activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic.

Wait, but the reaction is with NaNH2, which provides a strong base. Maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible in benzene.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring expansion or contraction. No, that's more for aliphatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination of HBr, but for that, we need adjacent H and Br. Wait, in benzene, the Br is attached to a carbon, but adjacent carbons have H's. Wait, but in benzene, each carbon has one H (assuming mono-substitution). However, in this case, the ring has more substituents.

Wait, in the compound 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, each of the carbons at positions 2 and 4 have a methyl group. So the structure would look like this:

Positions 1: Br; positions 2: CH3; positions 4: CH3. So the ring would have Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

So the adjacent carbons to Br (position 1) are positions 6 and 2. Position 2 has a methyl group, so no H there. Position 6 has a H (since the substituents are Br at 1, CH3 at 2, and CH3 at 4). Wait, no, position 6 would have a H only if there's no substituent there. Let me think: benzene is a six-membered ring. So position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl group, so position 6 is adjacent to position 1 and 5. Are there substituents at 5? No, because the substituents are at 1,2,4.

So, position 6 would have a hydrogen.

So, the structure has Br at 1, CH3 at 2 and 4, and H at 6.

Now, in this case, when treated with NaNH2, a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton that is adjacent to the Br. Wait, but only position 6 is adjacent to position 1 and has an H. So the base could abstract the H at position 6, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1 and a carbene or something else.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of elimination. If the H at position 6 is abstracted, then a double bond could form between positions 1 and 6, but benzene already has conjugated double bonds. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: NaNH2 in ammonia is typically used for dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aliphatic systems. For example, in benzyl bromide, treatment with NaNH2 would eliminate HBr and form a benzene ring with a triple bond (like forming a benzene ring plus a triple bond, but I'm not sure).

Wait, wait, but in this case, it's an aromatic ring. So perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the base is deprotonating a position, making the ring more activated towards substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of possible products. The question is how many possible organic products are formed.

If the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, elimination could lead to the formation of a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this is a case of forming a benzene ring with a nitro group, but NaNH2 doesn't introduce nitro groups. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring with a cyano group, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing elimination of HBr, forming a new substituent. But how? Let's think: if the H is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination of HBr could occur, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but benzene is an aromatic ring. If you form a double bond, would that disrupt the aromaticity? That's unlikely. Wait, no, because benzene already has conjugated double bonds. So maybe forming a triple bond—wait, that's more like forming a benzynes, but that's for elimination in certain cases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about benzene substitution. Another possibility is that the methyl groups adjacent to the Br could undergo some reaction. For example, perhaps the methyl group at position 2 is a good leaving group? But methyl isn't a good leaving group. Unless something else happens.

Wait, but the reaction is with NaNH2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's deprotonating a position that's activated.

Wait, in the case of para-substituted rings, sometimes elimination can form a diradical or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are directing the substitution. Since they are activating groups, they can direct incoming nucleophiles to certain positions.

Wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring is usually deactivated by electron-withdrawing groups. Since here, the substituents (methyl) are electron-donating, the ring is activated for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination. Let me think: if the Br is at position 1, and the ring has methyl groups at 2 and 4, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6. Then, elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6. But wait, benzene already has double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps this leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, which isn't possible. Or maybe it leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but I don't think that's feasible here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a demethylation, but NaNH2 isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are deprotonated, but methyl groups are stable and don't usually lose protons under such conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an aromatic ring with a triple bond. Wait, benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond. But in this case, we only have one Br, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming a methyl shift. Like, if the methyl group at position 2 is adjacent to Br, and the base abstracts a proton, maybe a hydride shift occurs, leading to a different substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not possible, and no product forms. But that's unlikely because the options don't include zero.

Wait, another angle: the number of possible products. If the reaction leads to different isomers, how many would form?

Wait, if elimination is possible, forming a triple bond (like benzene turning into a triple bond), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a diradical, which then could form different structures.

Wait, perhaps the NaNH2 is causing a ring expansion or contraction. But I'm not familiar with such reactions under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. For that, the Br would leave, and the NH2^- would attack. But for that to happen, the ring would need to be activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which it isn't because methyl groups are activating, making it more susceptible to electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but if NaNH2 provides the amide ion (NH2^-), which is a strong nucleophile, perhaps it can attack the ring. But without activating groups for nucleophilic substitution, that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about similar reactions. For example, when toluene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, what happens? Wait, toluene is methylbenzene. In the presence of a strong base, perhaps deprotonation occurs at the methyl group, but that's not very likely. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, but I don't think so.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But under what conditions?

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to outline possible products.

If the reaction leads to substitution, perhaps the NH2^- could attack the ring, but where? The methyl groups are activating, so the most reactive positions would be ortho and para to the methyl groups.

Wait, but the ring already has substituents. The Br is at position 1, and methyl at 2 and 4. So the possible positions for substitution are 3,5,6, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to formation of a double bond, but in benzene that's not possible because all positions are conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the aromatic ring but on the substituents. For example, the methyl groups might undergo deprotonation and elimination, but that's usually for aliphatic compounds.

Wait, methyl groups don't have acidic protons under normal conditions. The pKa of a methyl proton is around 48, which is much higher than what NaNH2 can deprotonate (since NaNH2 has a strong base, but I think NaNH2 can deprotonate things with pKa around 35 or lower).

So, perhaps the methyl groups are not reacting here.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possibility of forming a benzene ring with fewer substituents. For example, if the Br leaves and nothing else happens, but that would require some kind of elimination or substitution, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group. But for that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic substitution. But in our case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are activating for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So perhaps this isn't feasible.

Wait, but in some cases, when a substituent is both activating and meta-directing, maybe that could influence where the substitution occurs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a position, making it more susceptible to substitution. For example, if a proton is abstracted from position 3, which is between the methyl groups at 2 and 4, perhaps that position becomes more activated.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should consider the possible products based on the substituents.

If the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But under what conditions would that happen? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2, but that would require adjacent Br and a leaving group, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think differently. The number of possible products is the question. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So perhaps the reaction leads to multiple isomers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation, where Br is removed, and the ring adjusts.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a reducing agent. Or is it?

Wait, if NaNH2 in ammonia is used to eliminate HBr, perhaps the ring contracts or something else happens. For example, in the case of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, elimination of HBr could lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond in a different position, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. But with benzene, opening the ring usually requires harsh conditions, and I don't think NaNH2 in ammonia would do that.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the reaction is a substitution, the Br could be replaced by NH2. But would that lead to more than one product? Because the ring is symmetric, perhaps not.

Wait, wait. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. The substituents are at positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). So the molecule is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So, if substitution occurs, where would the NH2 group go?

In nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile would attack the position that's most activated. But in this case, the ring is activated by the methyl groups. The methyl groups at 2 and 4 would activate positions 3, 5, and 6 for electrophilic substitution. But since we're dealing with a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps the activating groups aren't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups deactivate the ring for nucleophilic substitution. Wait, methyl groups are activating for electrophilic substitution but not for nucleophilic. So perhaps the site of substitution isn't activated, and substitution doesn't occur.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look up what happens when 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a demethylation, but I don't think methyl groups are easily removed by NaNH2.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond. For that, two adjacent leaving groups are needed, but we only have one Br.

Hmm. Maybe this is a trick question. Let me think about the possible products again. If the Br is replaced by NH2, perhaps the product is 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But in that case, would there be multiple products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a new structure. Let's imagine that the Br is at position 1, and elimination occurs between position 1 and position 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that would form a triple bond in the ring, which is highly strained (like a benzene ring with a triple bond, which is not stable). Alternatively, perhaps the ring loses a carbon, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then react further, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I don't think so under these conditions.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess here.

If the reaction is a substitution, and the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile, replacing Br, then the product would be a single isomer because the starting material is symmetric. So only one product.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps no product forms or only one product.

But the options are 4, 1, 2, 3. So perhaps the correct answer is 1 product (option B).

Wait, but why would that be the case? If substitution occurs, and the starting material is symmetric, then the substitution would occur at a specific position, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a single product.

Hmm. But I'm not confident. Another angle: how many possible positions could the nucleophile attack in a substitution reaction?

The starting material has Br at position 1. The substituents are at 2 and 4, which are both methyl groups. So, the positions adjacent to Br are 2 (CH3) and 6 (H). The other substituent is at 4 (CH3).

So, in substitution, the nucleophile could attack at position 1, but that's where Br is. Wait, no, substitution would replace Br.

Wait, no, in substitution, the Br leaves, and the nucleophile (NH2^-) comes in. So the position would be at 1, leading to 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But since the starting material is symmetric, there's only one possible product.

So, substitution leads to one product. Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps it's a single product as well.

Alternatively, perhaps multiple products form due to different sites of substitution, but I don't see how in this case.

Wait, another possibility: if the nucleophile can attack at different positions due to the symmetry. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 4, making the molecule symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So any substitution would only occur at position 1, leading to a single product.

So the number of possible products is 1, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. The structure of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene has a bromine atom at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and a hydrogen atom at position 6.

Key considerations for the reaction include:

1. **Substitution Reaction**: NaNH₂ could act as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom with an amide group (NH₂). For nucleophilic aromatic substitution to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. However, methyl groups are electron-donating and activate the ring for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. Thus, substitution is unlikely.

2. **Elimination Reaction**: NaNH₂ could abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine atom (e.g., at position 6), leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. However, benzene is already an aromatic ring with conjugated π-bonds, and forming a double bond would not disrupt aromaticity. Elimination is also unlikely under these conditions.

3. **Symmetry of the Starting Material**: The molecule is symmetric across the 1-4 axis, meaning any substitution or elimination would lead to a single product due to the lack of distinguishable positions for reaction.

Given the above analysis, the reaction does not proceed via substitution or elimination, and no significant products are formed. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **zero**. However, since the options provided do not include zero, the most plausible interpretation is that no reaction occurs, leading to the conclusion that there is only **one product** (the starting material itself).

Answer: B
