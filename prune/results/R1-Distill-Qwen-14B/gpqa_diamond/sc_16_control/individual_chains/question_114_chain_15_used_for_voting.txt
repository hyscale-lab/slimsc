Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem has two parts, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let me look at each reaction separately.

First reaction:
Butan-2-one (which is another name for 2-butanone) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, what's that product? Let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I'm thinking nucleophilic addition. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ion. So in a ketone, the carbonyl is attacked by the CN- nucleophile. But since the carbonyl is in a ketone, it's less reactive than aldehydes, but still can do. So the product would be a cyanohydrin. The structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no. Let me think: when a ketone like (CH3)2CO reacts with CN-, it adds across the carbonyl, making a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons.

Butanenitrile is four carbons. Wait, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)C(OH)CN connected to another CH2? Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN? No, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's four carbons? Wait, nitrile is -CN. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane has four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But the product's structure would have a hydroxy and a methyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but that's longer than four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let me think about the reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN as the cyanohydrin. But wait, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? Because the carbon chain would be three carbons. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, that's four carbons. Did I get that wrong?

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a different mechanism. Oh wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN, it forms the cyanohydrin (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the question says the product is butanenitrile. Hmm. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents. So the first step is adding NaCN to the ketone. So for the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and something else, A. Wait, but in the presence of an acid catalyst perhaps? Because often in such additions, like in the formation of cyanohydrins, an acid catalyst is used. Or wait, maybe a base?

Wait, no. Wait, the addition of HCN to ketones typically forms a cyanohydrin. But in the presence of an acid, is that correct? Or is it without? Let me think. The addition of HCN to ketones is usually done in an aqueous acidic solution. Because HCN is a weak acid, and to get the CN- to attack, maybe you need to deprotonate it. So perhaps you add HCN with a catalyst, like H3O+ (acid). So in the first reaction, NaCN is providing CN- and maybe the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+.

Wait, but the reaction is written as butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the catalyst or another reagent. So, for the addition of CN- to the ketone, in a nucleophilic addition, you might need an acid catalyst. Wait, but in some cases, such as the formation of cyanohydrins, you can do it under acidic conditions. So perhaps A is H3O+.

But another option is that if you have a base like NaHSO3, but wait, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weak base maybe? Or perhaps it's acting as a base in some way. Alternatively, sometimes in such reactions, H2SO4 is used as a catalyst, but in the options, I don't think that's present. So for the first step, A could be H3O+.

So the first part of the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → product. So that's option A or B, since options C and D have NaHSO3 as A.

But then, moving on to the second reaction. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxy group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the product is a carboxylic acid, with the same substituents.

So that's the nitrile being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. Under what conditions does that happen?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids with strong oxidizing agents. Common methods include using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. For example, in aqueous HCl with heat. Alternatively, using other strong oxidizing agents like K2Cr2O7 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent B is given, and it's used with H2O. So perhaps B is an acid, like HCl, which would help in the oxidation.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. Option C has B as HCl. Let's see.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction: the starting material is a nitrile, and it's converted into a carboxylic acid. So the oxidation would require an acidic environment. So H+ (like from HCl) is present.

So for the second part, reagent B is HCl. Because it's adding H2O as well, so perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

Wait, but wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to give carboxylic acids. So using HCl as the acid catalyst, with water, and perhaps heat.

So for the second reaction, B would be HCl.

Putting it together: in the options, the first part (reagent A) is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The second part (reagent B) should be HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → this fits.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → but then A would be NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about.

So let's think again about the first reaction. If A is H3O+, then the first step is adding CN- under acidic conditions to the ketone, forming the cyanohydrin.

Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^- ions. What would that do? HSO3^- is a weak base, maybe. Wait, but in some cases, HSO3^- can act as a base, but in other cases, perhaps it's used for something else. Wait, but in the presence of a nitrile, maybe not. Alternatively, sometimes HSO3^- is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, but that's under different conditions.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin. So I think the first step requires an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+. So in the first part, reagent A is H3O+.

So options A and B have A as H3O+. Then, for B, in the second reaction, we need HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl.

So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Another possibility: in the first reaction, perhaps NaHSO3 is acting as a source of H+ as well. Because NaHSO3 in solution would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^- which can further dissociate into H+ and SO3^2-? Or not? Wait, HSO3^- is a weak acid, so in water, it donates a proton to form H2O and SO3^2-.

Wait, but HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H2SO4, but stronger than HCN maybe. So if A is H3O+ (which is H+), that would provide the acid.

Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3, perhaps it's acting as the acid. Because HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating a proton. But in that case, the solution would be acidic.

So maybe both A and NaHSO3 are possible acid sources. So which is correct?

Wait, but I'm trying to remember the conditions for the formation of cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an aqueous solution of HCN with an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+.

So for the first reaction, the reagents would be NaCN (to supply CN-) and an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

So that would make A = H3O+.

Then, looking at the options, which have A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

That points to option A.

Wait, but let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is a nitrile and a hydroxyl on the same carbon. So 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When oxidized, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. How is that done?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions with strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 in HCl and heat. So B would be HCl, which is in option A.

So putting it all together, reagent A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So the correct option is option A.

Wait, let me make sure. Option A is: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Yes. So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which undergoes nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. This reaction forms a cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is typically required to facilitate the addition of CN⁻ to the carbonyl group. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (option A) is a suitable acid catalyst, while **NaHSO₃** (option C) is less likely to serve this purpose effectively.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

In this reaction, the nitrile group (-CN) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically requires strong oxidizing conditions, often involving an acid catalyst. **HCl** (option A) provides the necessary acidic environment for the oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. **CH₃COOH** (option B) is not strong enough to drive this reaction efficiently.

### Conclusion:
For the first reaction, **H₃O⁺** is the appropriate reagent (A), and for the second reaction, **HCl** is the correct reagent (B). This matches **option A**.
