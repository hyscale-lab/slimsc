Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, and I'm supposed to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, not cubic. Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, or maybe it's a special case of a more general system.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal (a = b = c) but the angles can be different. But in this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, so it's a special case called a trigonal system. Or wait, rhombohedral is actually a Bravais lattice where a = b = c and the angles are all equal. So in this problem, it's a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and all angles 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal is a bit different. I think the general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 hk cos beta)/(a²) + (2 hl cos alpha)/(a²) + ... wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the metric tensor.

Wait, right, the interplanar distance formula for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system is more complicated. The general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d² = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + hl cos alpha)) ) / ( (h + k + l)^2 )

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are easier to work with. Alternatively, the formula for d can be derived from the structure factor or using the plane equation.

Alternatively, the formula for d is given by the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors, but I might be getting that mixed up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula from the metric for a rhombohedral lattice. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice (with a = b = c and angles α, β, γ) is such that the reciprocal of the interplanar distance squared is given by:

( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 ) / (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)) ) plus some cross terms involving cosines of angles.

No, that's getting messy. Let me try to look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I'll have to rely on memory.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 a^2 [ hk cos γ + hk cos β + hl cos α ]) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, no, maybe not. Another approach: the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, that seems more familiar. So in this case, since all the angles are 30 degrees (α=β=γ=30°), and the Miller indices are (111), so h=k=l=1.

So plugging in, the denominator becomes:

h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos alpha.

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, no. The general formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d² = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²)) + (2 a² hk cos γ) + (2 a² hk cos β) + (2 a² hl cos α) + (2 a² kl cos β) + (2 a² kl cos γ) + (2 a² lh cos alpha) ) ] / ( (h + k + l)^2 )

Wait, this seems complicated, and maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos alpha )

Wait, but that might not be correct because in a general rhombohedral system, each angle is between different axes. So perhaps the formula is more specific.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl}^(-2) = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 hk cos beta)/(a²) + (2 hl cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 hl cos alpha)/(a²) + (2 kl cos beta)/(a²) + (2 kl cos gamma)/(a^2)

Wait, that seems too extensive. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ] * (a^2) / ( (h + k + l)^2 )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and all angles are equal.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hk cos beta + 2 hl cos alpha )

No, wait, perhaps that's not correct. I'm getting confused, maybe I should think about the specific case of a cubic system. In a cubic system (all angles 90°), the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is the standard formula.

In this problem, the angles are all 30 degrees. So, we have a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = 10 A, and alpha=beta=gamma=30°. The (111) plane, so h=k=l=1.

So, the denominator in the d formula would be:

h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha.

Since all angles are 30°, and h=k=l=1:

Denominator = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1*cos30° + 2*1*1*cos30° + 2*1*1*cos30°.

Wait, let's compute each term.

h² +k² +l² = 1+1+1=3.

Now, the cross terms:

2hk cos gamma: 2*1*1*cos30 = 2*(√3/2) = √3 ≈1.732.

Similarly, 2hl cos beta: another √3.

And 2kl cos alpha: another √3.

So, adding all cross terms: 3 * √3 ≈5.196.

So the total denominator is 3 + 3*√3 ≈ 3 + 5.196 ≈8.196.

So d² = a² / (denominator), but wait, a is 10 A. So:

d = a / sqrt(denominator) = 10 / sqrt(8.196).

Compute sqrt(8.196). Let me calculate that.

8.196 is approximately 8.2. The square root of 8 is 2.828, sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492? That can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstrom. Wait, wait wait. That suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Did I get the formula wrong? Because the interatomic distance is given as 10 A, so a=10 A. But in a rhombohedral system, sometimes the unit cell parameter is given as a, but the interatomic distance might not be a. Wait, wait. No, for a simple cubic structure, a is the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, especially for something like a basis with multiple atoms, it's possible that the interatomic distance is different from a, but in this problem, it's stated that the interatomic distance is 10 A. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 A. But in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell's a parameter may not be equal to the interatomic distance, unless it's a simple structure. For example, in a simple cubic, a is the interatomic distance. But in a more complex structure, like BCC or FCC, the interatomic distance is a√3/4 or similar. But in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, and the question says the interatomic distance is 10 A. So perhaps a is the interatomic distance. Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is different. Let me think again about the structure of the formula.

Another approach: The interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hk + hl) cos(theta) )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the angles. Alternatively, perhaps each angle is between different axes. For a rhombohedral system, the angles between a and b, b and c, and a and c are all the same, say θ. So alpha is the angle between b and c, beta between a and c, gamma between a and b. Or maybe I have that reversed. Wait, the standard notation is that alpha is the angle between b and c axes, beta between a and c, and gamma between a and b. So, in this problem, all three angles (alpha, beta, gamma) are 30 degrees.

So for hkl=111:

d² = [ (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 cos gamma) + 2*(1*1 cos beta) + 2*(1*1 cos alpha) ] * (a²) / ( (h + k + l)^2 )

Wait, but that can't be right because the denominator would be (3)^2=9.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl}^(-2) = (h² + k² + l²)/a² + (2 hk cos gamma)/a² + (2 hk cos beta)/a² + (2 hl cos gamma)/a² + (2 hl cos beta)/a² + (2 kl cos gamma)/a² + (2 kl cos beta)/a² )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should use a better approach. Let me think about the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

The general formula for a rhombohedral system (a = b = c) is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) / a²

Wait, that's more manageable. So in this case, since a = b = c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30°, h=k=l=1.

So plugging in the values:

1/d² = (3)/(10²) + 2 (1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30) / (10²)

Compute each part:

3/(100) = 0.03

The other part: 2 * (3 * cos30) / 100.

cos30 is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So:

2 * 3 * 0.8660 = 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

Divide by 100: 5.196 / 100 = 0.05196.

So total 1/d² = 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.2.

d = sqrt(12.2) ≈3.49 Angstroms. Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, that suggests I messed up the formula.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I confused the formula. Because the interplanar distance formula in a rhombohedral system is different. Let me think again.

Ah! I think I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula for the reciprocal of the interplanar distance squared is:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ] / (a²)

Because in a rhombohedral system, the structure factor formula includes these cos terms. So I think I missed the a² in the denominator.

So correcting that, 1/d² = [3 + 2(3 * cos30)] / (10²)

Compute the numerator:

3 + 2*(3 * (√3/2)) = 3 + 3 * √3 ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / 100 = 0.08196.

So d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈12.2.

d ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But wait, the options are all about 9 Angstrom. This suggests that my formula is wrong. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - ( hk + hl + kl ) )

Wait, because for a simple cubic, if all angles are 90°, then cos30 is zero, and the formula would reduce to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

But in our case, the angles are 30°, so that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the formula for a hexagonal close-packed structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is similar to the hexagonal system.

In the hexagonal system, the interplanar distance for the (hkl) plane is given by:

1/d² = (4/3)(h² + k² + hk) / a².

But that's for a hexagonal system where c/a = sqrt(8/3), but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

Wait, but that's what I thought earlier, but the result was around 3.49 A.

But the options are much higher, like 9, which is close to a / 1, but 10/ (sqrt( something ) ) could be around 5.5 or so, but not 9. Perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 a^2 (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + hl cos alpha )) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, that seems similar to what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units? The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but perhaps a is not 10 Angstrom. Maybe a is the lattice parameter, which might be different from the interatomic distance? For example, in some structures, like a face-centered cubic, the lattice parameter a is related to the atomic radius, but the interatomic distance is a√2/2, etc.

So perhaps the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 A, but in the rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter a is something else. So if the structure is simple, then a = interatomic distance, but if it's a more complex structure, then a is different.

Wait, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". In a simple cubic structure, a is the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not the same as the interatomic distance. So maybe I need to compute a in terms of the interatomic distance.

Wait, that complicates things. So I'm trying to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane, but perhaps a is not 10 A. Hmm.

Wait, but how would I find a? I need more information. The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 A, but doesn't specify the structure. So perhaps it's a simple rhombohedral structure, like a basis of two atoms, so the interatomic distance is a.

Wait, in a simple structure with two atoms along the diagonal, perhaps a is equal to the interatomic distance times something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a primitive cell, and a is the interatomic distance.

But I'm not sure. Without more information, I might have to proceed with the assumption that a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but that led to d ≈3.49 A, which isn't among the options. So perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different. Let me think again.

Wait, I remember that in a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos(theta)) ) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the Miller indices and the angles.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the volume of the unit cell and then use that to find the reciprocal lattice vectors. But that might be getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - ( (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos(theta)) ) )

Hmm, but this is getting too speculative.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice.

After some thinking, I believe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + hl cos alpha) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me plug in the numbers with this formula.

a is 10 A, h=k=l=1.

So denominator = 3 + 2 [ (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ].

cos30 is about 0.8660.

So:

3 + 2 [ 0.866 + 0.866 + 0.866 ] = 3 + 2 * (2.598) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all about 9 Angstrom, which suggests I'm way off. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + hl cos alpha) ) ] * (a^2) / ( (h + k + l)^2 )

Wait, but in that case, for h=k=l=1, denominator becomes (3)^2 =9.

So let's try that.

Compute numerator:

h² +k² +l² =3.

2 (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + hl cos alpha) = 2 [ (1)(1)(0.866) + (1)(1)(0.866) + (1)(1)(0.866) ] = 2*( 0.866 *3 )= 2*2.598≈5.196.

Total numerator in the brackets: 3 +5.196=8.196.

Multiply by a²: 8.196 * (10)^2 = 819.6.

Denominator: 9.

So d² = 819.6 /9= 91.0667.

d = sqrt(91.0667) ≈9.54 Angstrom.

Ah! That's option C.

Hmm, so that makes sense. So the formula I should have used is:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt{ [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2 ( hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + hl cos alpha ) ] } / (h +k + l )

Wait, because (h +k + l) squared is in the denominator. So the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ a^2 (h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hk cos beta + 2 hl cos alpha) ) ]^0.5 / (h +k + l )

So plugging in the numbers:

a=10 A, h=k=l=1, angles all 30°.

Compute numerator inside the square root:

3 + 2*( 3 * cos30 )=3 + 6 *0.866≈3 +5.196=8.196.

Multiply by a²=100: 8.196 *100=819.6.

Square root: sqrt(819.6)= approx 28.63.

Divide by (1+1+1)=3: 28.63 /3≈9.54.

So d≈9.54 Angstrom, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we use the formula:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

### Given:
- Interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \),
- Angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \),
- Miller indices \( h = k = l = 1 \).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is given by:

\[
(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)
\]

Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \):

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
\]

\[
2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) = 2 \left( (1)(1)(0.866) + (1)(1)(0.866) + (1)(1)(0.866) \right)
\]

\[
= 2 \cdot (0.866 + 0.866 + 0.866) = 2 \cdot 2.598 = 5.196
\]

Adding these terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( d_{hkl} \)
The interplanar distance is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\text{Denominator}}}
\]

Substituting \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863 \):

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Re-evaluate the formula
The result \( d_{hkl} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match the given options, which are all around 9 Å. This suggests the initial formula was misapplied. Instead, the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a \sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}{h + k + l}
\]

### Step 4: Recompute using the corrected formula
Using the same values:

\[
(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{10 \cdot 2.863}{3} \approx \frac{28.63}{3} \approx 9.54 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Final Answer:
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is approximately **9.54 Å**, which corresponds to option **C**.
