Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

First, I need to identify the structure of the starting compound. The compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, cyclopentenol would have a five-membered ring with an -OH group and a double bond. The numbering would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (since it's cyclopent-1-enol). And there are two methyl groups on carbon 4. So, the structure would be a cyclopentane ring where carbon 1 has a double bond to carbon 2, and carbon 4 has two methyl substituents, and there's an -OH group on carbon 1 as well? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in enols, the structure has an adjacent double bond and an alcohol group. For cyclopent-1-enol, the OH would be on carbon 1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2? Or is it between C2 and C3? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the enol form is when the double bond is adjacent to the alcohol group. So for cyclopent-1-enol, the structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH group on C1? Or perhaps on C2. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Cyclopentane ring with five carbons. Enol structure. So, the enol has a double bond next to the -OH. So, for cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, and the double bond is C1-C2. So, the structure is a ring with the double bond between 1 and 2, and the OH on 1. But wait, that's adjacent to the double bond, which makes sense for an enol. So, yes.

Wait, but wait again. The IUPAC name is cyclopent-1-enol. The enol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group on C2. Because in enols, the structure is H2C=CH-OH, but in a ring. Wait, no, maybe not. Actually, the enol form is where the alcohol is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. So, cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C1 or C2. Wait, I think the numbering is such that the double bond starts at the lower possible number. So, if the OH is on C1, then the double bond would be between C1 and C2, making the name 1-enol. Alternatively, if the OH is on C2, the double bond could be between C1 and C2, but that would also be 1-enol.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about it. The enol form is when the carbonyl group is converted into an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So, for example, cyclopentanone would have the carbonyl on C1, and in the enol form, the carbonyl becomes a CH(OH) group, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So, the structure would have an OH on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

So, the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol would be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine (Br2) is a dienophile in some cases, but more commonly, it's a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions, but here, the question is about the addition. Alternatively, bromine in a nonpolar solvent would undergo addition to double bonds via an electrophilic addition mechanism.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is an enol, which is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So, in this case, the molecule is an enol, which is a conjugated system of double bond and hydroxyl group.

But when you have a dienol, like 1,3-diene with an alcohol group, but in this case, it's a cyclopentenol, a five-membered ring with a double bond.

So, the reaction of an enol (like cyclopentenol) with bromine typically leads to dihydroxybromination or dibromination, or possibly other reactions. Alternatively, the enol can undergo bromination at the double bond.

Wait, but wait again. Enols are more reactive than ketones because the enol form is resonance-stabilized. So, the double bond in the enol is more electron-rich because of the adjacent hydroxyl group, which can donate electron density via resonance.

So, when Br2 reacts with an enol, it would add across the double bond. Bromine is an electrophilic addition reagent. So, the reaction would be an addition of Br2 to the double bond.

In a typical addition of bromine to an alkene, each Br adds to opposite sides, leading to a dibromide. But since the starting material is an enol, the reaction could proceed via a similar mechanism.

Wait, but wait: the enol has a conjugated system. So when Br2 adds to the double bond, the addition would be vicinal dibromide. So, the product would have two Br atoms added across the former double bond.

But wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. After adding Br2, the double bond C1-C2 would become C1-Br and C2-Br, but perhaps with some stereochemistry.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that some options have dibromides, and others have mono-brominated compounds.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Options B and C have mono-bromo products.

Wait, so why would the reaction give a mono-brominated product instead of a dibromide?

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive, and the reaction might lead to a different outcome, such as a bromohydrin formation. Wait, but that usually occurs when water is present. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds in a conjugate addition or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the enol can undergo a ring-opening or some other reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the enol could undergo a conjugate addition of Br2. Conjugate addition would add Br across the conjugated system, but in this case, the enol is a five-membered ring, so maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an electrophilic addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. So, the product would have two Br atoms added across C1 and C2, which were the positions of the double bond.

But looking back at the options, both options A and D are di-bromo derivatives. The difference is in the stereochemistry: A is 1R,2S; D is 1R,2R.

So, which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more complex and involves the hydroxyl group. Wait, bromine could also react with the alcohol group, but that's less likely since the double bond is more reactive.

Alternatively, the reaction might involve a bromohydrin formation, but I think that requires a different condition, such as a base, perhaps. Alternatively, the Br might add to the double bond, leading to a dibromide, but the OH might influence the addition.

Wait, but the enol form can also tautomerize to the ketone form, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. So, the structure is: a five-membered ring, with C1 bearing the OH, double bond C1-C2, and C4 having two methyl groups.

When Br2 adds to the double bond, which is between C1 and C2, each Br adds to each carbon. Because Br2 is a di-electrophile, the addition would be anti. So, the Br atoms would add to opposite faces, leading to a vicinal dibromide. The configuration would depend on the geometry of the starting double bond.

Wait, but what is the geometry of the starting double bond? The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is in the ring, which is a cyclopentene ring with substituents. So, is the double bond in a cis or trans configuration?

Wait, in a cyclopentene, the double bond is generally in the ring without much substituents, so the geometry can vary. But in this case, since the substituents are in a specific position, perhaps the double bond has a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but no, the starting material's double bond is in a ring. So, the substituents around the double bond are on the same face or opposite? Let me think about the structure: C1 has the OH, double bond to C2. C4 has two methyl groups, which are on the same carbon. So, the ring is arranged so that when looking at the ring, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the OH on C1, and C4 has two methyl groups. 

But regardless of that, the addition of Br2 would proceed through a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate, leading to anti addition. So, the Br would add to opposite faces, leading to a trans dibromide. So, in the product, the two Br atoms would be on opposite sides of the ring.

Wait, but in the options, A and D are both 1,2-dibromo. So, what about the stereochemistry?

In the starting material, the double bond is in the ring. Let's imagine the ring: if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on C1 are the OH and perhaps a methyl group? Wait, no, the methyl groups are on C4. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the chair-like transition state.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the chair conformation. But cyclopentane rings are usually puckered, not chair-like. Wait, cyclopentane is a five-membered ring with each carbon in a roughly equivalent position, so the transition state for the bromonium ion would be such that the two Br add anti.

So, the product would have each Br on adjacent carbons, and in a trans configuration.

Wait, but the options A and D are both 1,2-dibromo. So, let's look at their configurations. Option A is (1R,2S), which is trans. Option D is (1R,2R), which is cis.

Wait, but when Br adds across a double bond, the addition is anti, leading to a trans arrangement. So, in the case of cyclopentene, the addition of Br2 would give a trans dibromide. So, the Br would be on opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration.

Wait, but in a ring, the positions can be a bit tricky. Let me imagine the ring. If the starting double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1, then when Br adds, the Br on C1 would be on the same side as the OH, and the Br on C2 would be on the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Let me consider the cyclopentane ring as a five-membered ring. C1 is connected to C2 and C5. C2 is connected to C1 and C3. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the ring is C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C1.

The OH is on C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4.

Now, when Br2 adds to C1 and C2, each Br adds with anti stereochemistry. So, the Br on C1 will be added from one face, and the Br on C2 from the opposite face.

So, the configuration at C1 and C2 will be trans to each other.

Considering the ring structure, the substituents (Br) will end up on opposite faces, leading to a trans arrangement. Thus, the product would have the Br on C1 and C2 in a trans configuration.

Looking back at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which would be trans. Option D is (1R,2R), which is cis.

Wait, but how do the R and S configurations work here?

Let me consider the C1 and C2 centers. Each would have four substituents: for C1, the substituents are Br, OH, the ring (two adjacent carbons), and the methyl group on C4? Wait, no, C1 is connected to C2 (with Br), C5, and the OH and a hydrogen? Wait, the original compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the structure is:

- C1: double bond to C2, OH group, and connected to C5 and another substituent? Wait, in the cyclopentene, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents. So, C1 has double bond to C2, and has an OH group and a single bond to C5. Similarly, C2 has double bond to C1 and single bonds to C3 and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure correctly. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the ring is cyclopentane, with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. The two methyl groups are on C4.

So, the structure of the starting material:

C5 is connected to C4 and C1. C4 has two methyl groups, so perhaps it's attached to C3 and C5, and the two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the ring as:

Positions:
C1: double bond to C2, OH group, and single bond to C5.
C2: double bond to C1, and single bonds to C3 and another group (maybe a hydrogen?).
C3: single bonds to C2 and C4.
C4: two methyl groups and connected to C3 and C5.
C5: connected to C4 and C1.

So, when Br2 adds to the double bond between C1 and C2, each Br adds to C1 and C2, with anti stereochemistry. The addition would proceed with Br adding to C1 and C2 from opposite sides.

Now, let's think about the configuration of each carbon after addition.

At C1, after addition, the substituents are Br, OH, C2, and C5.

At C2, substituents are Br, C1, C3, and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but no, initially, C2 only has a single bond to C3, and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but in the enol, the structure is C1=C2-OH, but wait, no, the enol form is an alcohol next to a double bond.

So, in the starting material, C1 has double bond to C2 and an OH group. So, the structure is:

C1: double bond to C2, OH, and single bonds to C5 and another group (maybe a H).

C2: double bond to C1, single bonds to C3 and perhaps a H.

So, when Br2 adds, each Br adds to C1 and C2, with opposite stereochemistry.

Now, when the Br adds, what's the configuration? Let me consider the addition. The bromonium ion forms, and the Br adds from the opposite side.

So, for C1, which initially has the OH group, the addition of Br would be from the opposite side of the OH group. Similarly, for C2, the Br would add from the opposite side of the substituent that's on the same side as the initial substituent.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the bromonium ion. The double bond opens to form a bromonium ion, and the Br's add from opposite sides. So, if the initial double bond is trans, the addition would be anti.

But perhaps the key point is that the two Br's are added in a trans configuration.

Now, considering the possible diastereomers in the options, options A and D are both 1,2-dibromo, but with different configurations.

Option A: (1R,2S) → this would be a trans configuration because the Br's are on opposite sides.

Option D: (1R,2R) → a cis configuration.

Since the addition is anti, the product should have the trans configuration. So, the correct configuration would be (1R,2S) if the Br's are on the opposite sides.

Wait, but how do I assign R/S configurations?

Let me assign priorities. For C1:

Substituents are Br (highest priority), OH (next), C2, and C5.

Wait, the priority order is based on atomic number. So, Br is higher than O, which is higher than C.

So, for C1:

1. Br, 
2. OH (O), 
3. C2 (as a CH group),
4. C5 (as another CH group).

The arrangement around C1 would be Br, OH, and two CH groups.

To determine the configuration (R or S), we arrange the substituents in order of priority. The highest priority is Br, then OH, then the two CH groups. The OH is on a specific position, and the Br is added from the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.

At C1:

Substituents in order of priority:

1. Br (highest)
2. OH (O)
3. C2 (which is connected to C3, which is connected to C4 with two methyl groups. So, the substituent is a CH2 group perhaps? Or a CH group? Hmm, maybe I should think about the substituents as chains.

Wait, perhaps for C1, the substituents are:

- Br (1)
- OH (2)
- C2 (3, since it's a CH- group)
- C5 (4, also a CH- group)

Wait, but the substituents are arranged in a particular way. Let me imagine looking along C1's axis.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to assign the configuration using a model.

Assume that after addition, the Br on C1 is on the front, and the Br on C2 is on the back. But wait, the addition is anti, so if Br adds to C1 from the front, Br on C2 would add from the back.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br on C1 is in a certain direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomer formed would depend on the approach of the bromine.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product structure.

The product is a vicinal dibromide, where the two Br atoms are trans to each other. So, the configuration would be such that the two Br's are on opposite faces.

Now, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which implies that the two Brs are trans. Option D is (1R,2R), which would be cis.

So, if the addition is anti, the product should be (1R,2S), which is option A.

But wait, another thought: the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. When the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are arranged such that the methyl groups are on C4.

In the reaction, when Br adds, the ring's substituents (like the methyl groups on C4) may influence the approach of bromine. But perhaps that's beyond the scope for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at the dibromide but undergoes some other process, like oxidation or elimination.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the enol's acidity. Enols are more acidic than alcohols because of resonance stabilization of the deprotonated form. But in this reaction, Br2 is the reagent, which is more of an electrophile, not a base.

So, the reaction is most likely an electrophilic addition of Br2 to the double bond, leading to a dibromide.

But looking at the options, options A and D are dibromides, while B and C are mono-brominated. So, why would the reaction give a mono-bromide?

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo a conjugate addition with Br. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps bromine adds as a bromonium ion, but then the ring might open in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromohydrin. But that usually requires water and a base, which aren't mentioned here.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the hydroxyl group affects the addition. For example, the enol could add Br across the double bond, and the OH group could influence the regiochemistry or stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more likely to proceed through a cyclic bromonium intermediate, leading to a trans addition.

So, if the product is a vicinal dibromide, the correct option would be either A or D.

But let me think again about the configuration. When bromine adds to a double bond, the Br's add anti, so the configuration would be trans. So, the product should have Br's on opposite sides.

Now, considering the structure of the product, the substituents on C1 are Br, OH, and two ring carbons. The substituents on C2 are Br, two ring carbons, and perhaps a hydrogen.

The stereogenic centers are at C1 and C2 because each has four different substituents.

At C1: substituents are Br, OH, C2, C5.

At C2: substituents are Br, C1, C3, and a hydrogen perhaps.

Wait, but in the starting material, C2 is sp² hybridized, but after addition, it becomes sp³ with four substituents.

So, each of C1 and C2 becomes a stereogenic center.

Now, when the Br adds, the configuration will depend on the approach of the Br.

Assuming that the starting double bond is in a certain geometry, the addition will lead to a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has the OH on C1 and the double bond between C1 and C2. So, if the double bond is in a certain position, the addition of Br would lead to the Br's being on opposite sides.

But without knowing the exact geometry, perhaps the product will have a trans configuration, leading to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), which would be the case for option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomer is determined by the methyl groups on C4. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: looking at the options, option B and C have mono-brominated products. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as an addition but as some other substitution or electrophilic attack on the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the OH group is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond, making the enol more reactive. So, perhaps bromine could add to the double bond, but maybe the OH group is also a site for bromine attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the OH group is replaced by Br. But that would require an acid catalyst, perhaps, and a good leaving group. But in this case, the starting material is an enol, which may not easily undergo substitution without such conditions.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a pinacol-like rearrangement, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Another possibility: the enol could react with bromine in a way to form a bromoketone. Wait, in the presence of certain conditions, enols can undergo oxidation to form ketones, but I'm not sure how bromine would fit into that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an electrophilic attack leading to a bromohydrin, but I'm not sure. Bromohydrin formation usually requires a base to deprotonate the enol, forming a conjugate base which then attacks Br2.

Wait, but in the absence of a base, the reaction would proceed as an addition to the double bond.

So, perhaps the major product is the dibromide, either A or D.

Now, looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, cyclopentanone would imply a ketone structure, which would be the tautomer of the enol. So, if the enol reacts, perhaps the product is a ketone with a bromine.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed process where the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, and then the ketone reacts with bromine. But bromine typically doesn't add to ketones unless under specific conditions like those used in the haloform reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the OH is replaced by Br, but that would require a good leaving group, which OH isn't unless protonated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the double bond is more reactive, leading to the addition of Br2, and then the OH group is somehow oxidized or loses a proton.

But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with bromine in a conjugate addition, leading to the formation of a bromoketone. Wait, conjugate addition (Michael addition) usually involves adding a nucleophile to the beta position, but Br2 isn't a nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me rethink the possibilities.

Enols can undergo bromination in the presence of certain conditions, but perhaps more commonly, the reaction is an addition across the double bond.

So, the major product should be a dibromide, either option A or D.

Between A and D, the configuration depends on the addition sterechemistry.

In anti addition, the Br's are on opposite sides, leading to (1R,2S) configuration, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the same configuration, (1R,2R), but that would be if the addition were syn, which is not typical for bromine.

So, option A would be the product of anti addition.

But wait, another consideration: the ring's structure.

In a cyclopentane ring, the addition of Br to C1 and C2 in a trans fashion would lead to a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, if the two Br's are on opposite faces of the ring, then the configuration would be trans. So, for C1, if the Br is on the top face, and the OH on the bottom, then the Br on C2 would be on the bottom face, leading to a trans arrangement across the ring.

But how does that translate into R and S configurations?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound, but since the molecule is chiral, it's not meso.

Wait, wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The presence of two methyl groups on C4 makes that carbon symmetric, so the molecule might not be chiral. Hmm, but the product after addition would have two Brs on adjacent carbons, which could make each of those carbons chiral centers.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric with two methyl groups on C4, then the two chiral centers (C1 and C2) could be mirror images, leading to a meso compound. So, maybe the product is a meso compound, meaning the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making the R and S configurations cancel each other out.

Wait, for example, in tartaric acid, the two chiral centers can be R,R; S,S; or R,S (meso).

If that's the case, perhaps the product is a meso compound, which would have a specific configuration.

In that scenario, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which would be a meso form if the molecule is symmetric. Similarly, option D is (1R,2R), which would not be meso.

So, if the product is a meso compound, then option A would be the correct answer.

But wait, the methyl groups are on C4, which is across the ring from C1 and C2. So, the symmetry would depend on whether the substituents on C4 make the molecule symmetric.

Looking at the structure, the two methyl groups are on C4, which is opposite to the C1-C2 double bond. So, the ring is symmetric with respect to the plane passing through C4 and the center of the ring.

Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C4 and the center, making the product a meso compound if the Brs are added in a way that the configurations are mirror images.

So, if C1 is R and C2 is S, then across the plane of symmetry, each would be mirror images, leading to an overall achiral (meso) compound.

So, the product would be a meso compound, which would correspond to option A.

Alternatively, if the Br's were added in a way that both are R, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry and would be chiral, which would correspond to option D.

But in this case, since the starting material has symmetry (due to the two methyl groups on C4), the addition of Br2 would lead to a meso compound, making option A the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't meso. Wait, perhaps the addition doesn't make it meso because the substituents are in a certain arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the starting material's symmetry leads to the product being a racemic mixture, but in this case, perhaps the reaction only forms a single diastereomer due to the ring's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction yields a single diastereomer because of the ring's constraints.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Options:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol → meso form.

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone → mono-bromide, ketone.

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone → bromo on C4.

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol → diastereomer.

So, considering the reaction, if Br adds to the double bond, the product is a dibromide. So, options A and D are dibromides.

If the reaction is a ketone formation, then options B and C are possibilities.

But why would the reaction form a ketone? The starting material is an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. But in the presence of Br2, perhaps the enol adds Br across the double bond, leading to a di-bromide.

But another possibility: the enol could react with Br2 in a substitution, replacing the OH with Br. But I don't think that's likely without a good leaving group and possibly an acid catalyst.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is the oxidation of the enol to the ketone, but that would require an oxidizing agent, not Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrin formation, where Br adds to one end and OH to the other. But that requires a base to deprotonate the enol.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the reaction of an enol with bromine, the most likely product is the dibromide formed via electrophilic addition.

Now, considering the sterochemistry and the symmetry, the product is a meso compound, so the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, another angle: maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a bromoketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the enol reacts to form a ketone, and then the ketone undergoes bromination. But ketones typically don't react with bromine unless under specific conditions like the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which is for alpha-bromination. But that requires a peracid or other conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol adds Br across the double bond, leading to a di-bromide. So, the product would be a di-bromide.

Thus, the major product is a di-bromide, either A or D.

Given that the addition is anti, the product is (1R,2S), which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, an enol with a double bond between C1 and C2, an OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. The reagent, bromine (Br₂), is an electrophile that typically reacts with alkenes via anti-addition to form a vicinal dibromide. The enol's conjugated system increases the reactivity of the double bond, making it more susceptible to bromination.

When Br₂ adds to the double bond, a bromonium ion intermediate forms, leading to anti-addition of the two bromine atoms across the double bond. This results in a vicinal dibromide with the bromine atoms on opposite sides of the ring. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the anti-addition mechanism, which favors a trans configuration.

The starting material has a plane of symmetry due to the two methyl groups on C4, and the product retains this symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the product is a meso compound, where the chiral centers at C1 and C2 are mirror images of each other. The meso compound corresponds to the (1R,2S) configuration, as indicated in option A.

Options B and C suggest mono-brominated products, which are unlikely because the reaction conditions favor addition to the double bond rather than substitution or oxidation. Option D represents a (1R,2R) configuration, which would not be consistent with the anti-addition mechanism or the symmetry of the molecule.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
