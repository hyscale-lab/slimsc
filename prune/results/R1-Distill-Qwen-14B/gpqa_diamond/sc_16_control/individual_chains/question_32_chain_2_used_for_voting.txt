Alright, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Okay, the question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus here is probably a heavy one, but wait, the question says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons make 6 nucleons.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I think this is a relativistic energy problem. So, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. Let me write it down:

v = 0.96c
beta = v/c = 0.96

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)
So, beta squared is (0.96)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

So, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? Same for a neutron, about 939 MeV/c². But wait, actually, the exact mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², and a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². But maybe for simplicity, I can approximate both to around 938.3 MeV each.

Wait, but wait, there's another approach. The mass of Li-6 can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0175693 u. Hmm, yeah, I remember that from the periodic table. One atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So let's calculate the rest mass energy.

So, the mass m = 6.0175693 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u. Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.0175693 * 931.5 is approximately 16.355. So total is roughly 5589 +16.355 ≈ 5605.355 MeV, which is 5.605355 GeV. Wait, wait, 6.0175693 *931.5: let me compute it accurately.

Wait 6 *931.5 is 5589. 0.0175693 *931.5 = 0.0175693 *900=15.81237; 0.0175693 *31.5=0.55467. So total is 15.81237 +0.55467= 16.36704. So 5589+16.36704=5605.36704 MeV, which is 5.605367 GeV.

So, the rest mass energy is about 5.605 GeV. Wait, but wait, wait. No, the mass is given in atomic mass units, but the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly different from the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy. But in this calculation, perhaps we can just take the atomic mass as the rest mass. So m ≈ 6.0175693 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

So m c² is 6.0175693 * 931.5 MeV = let me compute that more accurately.

6.0175693 * 931.5 = let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589. Then 0.0175693 *931.5. Let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.0075693*931.5≈7.063. So 9.315 +7.063=16.378. So total is 5589 +16.378=5605.378 MeV, which is 5.605378 GeV. So approximately 5.605 GeV.

So the rest energy is about 5.605 GeV. Now, the total energy E is gamma times m c².

We have gamma as approximately 3.5714, and m c² is 5.605 GeV. So E= gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.605 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3 *5.605 is 16.815. 0.5714 *5.605: Hmm, 0.5 *5.605 is 2.8025, 0.0714*5.605≈0.402, so total about 3.2045. So 16.815 +3.2045=20.0195 GeV. Wait, but wait, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 3.5714 multiplied by 5.605:

Compute 3.5 *5.605 = 19.6175.

Then 0.0714 *5.605: 0.07 *5.605 = 0.39235, 0.0014*5.605=0.007847. So total 0.39235+0.007847=0.4002. So 19.6175 +0.4002 =20.0177 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately with exact numbers. Let's see: 3.5714 *5.605.

Let me write it as (3 + 0.5714) *5.605 =3*5.605 +0.5714 *5.605.

3*5.605 =16.815.

0.5714 *5.605: Let's compute step by step.

0.5 *5.605=2.8025

0.0714 *5.605: 5.605 *0.07 =0.39235; 5.605 *0.0014=0.007847.

So 0.39235 +0.007847=0.400197.

So 2.8025 +0.400197=3.202697.

Adding to the 16.815 gives 16.815 +3.202697=20.017697 GeV.

So about 20.0177 GeV. Wait, but wait, the options are given with four decimal places. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, my calculation gives about 20.0177 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132) but not exactly. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in gamma calculation. Let me recheck beta and gamma.

Beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28≈3.57142857.

Ah, wait, but let me compute 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) more accurately.

sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = sqrt(1 -0.9216)=sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, maybe I should compute the product more accurately. So gamma is 3.57142857... and m c² is 5.605378 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.605378.

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

3.57142857 times 5.605378.

Let me break it into parts.

3 *5.605378 =16.816134.

0.57142857 *5.605378.

Compute 0.5 *5.605378 =2.802689.

0.07142857 *5.605378.

Let me compute 5.605378 *0.07 =0.39237646.

5.605378 *0.00142857.

Wait, 0.00142857 is approximately 1/700, so 5.605378 * 0.00142857 ≈5.605378 *0.00142857 ≈0.0080005.

So adding the two parts: 0.39237646 +0.0080005 ≈0.40037696.

So 0.5 part is 2.802689, 0.07142857 part is 0.400377. So total for 0.57142857 part is 2.802689 +0.400377=3.203066.

Adding to the 16.816134 gives total E=16.816134 +3.203066=20.0192 GeV.

Wait, so approximately 20.0192 GeV. But the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's higher than my calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Let me check the atomic mass of Li-6.

Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.0175693 u. So, when I calculate m c², 6.0175693 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.0175693 *931.5.

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.0175693 *931.5=?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.0075693 *931.5= let me compute that.

931.5 *0.007 =6.5205.

931.5 *0.0005693= approximately 0.528.

So 6.5205 +0.528=7.0485.

So 9.315 +7.0485=16.3635.

So total is 5589 +16.3635=5605.3635 MeV, which is 5.6053635 GeV.

So m c² is 5.6053635 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6053635.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6053635.

Break it down:

3 *5.6053635 =16.8160905.

0.57142857 *5.6053635.

Compute 0.5 *5.6053635=2.80268175.

0.07142857 *5.6053635.

Calculate 5.6053635 *0.07 =0.392375445.

5.6053635 *0.00142857.

Wait, 0.00142857 is 1/700. 5.6053635 * (1/700) = 5.6053635 /700 ≈0.008007662.

So add 0.392375445 +0.008007662=0.400383107.

So 0.5 part is 2.80268175, 0.07142857 part is 0.400383107. Sum is 3.203064857.

Adding to 16.8160905 gives 16.8160905 +3.203064857 =20.019155 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0192 GeV.

But the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 20.0192 GeV. The closest is option C (20.132), but that's about 0.11 GeV higher. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the mass of the nucleus. Wait, when you have a nucleus, the mass is not exactly equal to the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. But in this case, when calculating the rest mass energy, perhaps I should have considered the exact atomic mass, including electrons. Wait, but no, the nucleus would consist of protons and neutrons, so the electrons would not be part of the nucleus. Wait, but wait, the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons? No, no, wait, the nucleus doesn't include electrons. The atom includes electrons, but the nucleus is the protons and neutrons.

Wait, so perhaps my calculation of the rest mass of the nucleus is correct as 6.0175693 u. But maybe the value I used for u to MeV is slightly off. Let me check: 1 u is approximately 931.494 MeV/c². So I used 931.5, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96^2))=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation requires more precise computation without approximating gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, but I think that's already precise.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is that the formula for the energy is actually gamma multiplied by m c², but perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes in particle physics, the energy refers to kinetic energy, but in collider physics, it's usually the total energy.

Wait, the question says 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c.' So I think the energy given is the total energy, not just the kinetic. Because the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c², and the total is gamma m c².

So unless the problem is asking for kinetic energy, but the question is about the energy of the collider, which is usually the total energy.

Wait, the options don't have the correct value. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mass is not 6 u? Let me think again: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass is the sum of their masses minus binding energy. Alternatively, using the exact mass given by the atomic mass, which includes electrons.

Wait, no. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0175693 u, and a Li atom has 3 electrons. So the nucleus's mass would be 6.0175693 u minus 3*(electron mass). The electron mass is about 0.00054858 u. So 3*(0.00054858)=0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.0175693 -0.00164574=6.01592356 u.

So m =6.01592356 u.

Then, m c²=6.01592356 *931.5 MeV/u.

So let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.01592356 *931.5= let's compute.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00592356 *931.5= about 5.519.

So 9.315+5.519=14.834.

So total is 5589+14.834=5603.834 MeV=5.603834 GeV.

So the rest mass is now 5.603834 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603834.

Compute this.

3.57142857 *5.603834.

Break it down: 3 *5.603834=16.811502.

0.57142857 *5.603834.

Compute 0.5 *5.603834=2.801917.

0.07142857 *5.603834.

Compute 5.603834 *0.07=0.39226838.

5.603834 *0.00142857= approx 0.008002.

So 0.39226838 +0.008002≈0.400270.

So 0.5 part is 2.801917, 0.07142857 part is 0.400270. Sum is 3.202187.

Adding to 16.811502 gives total E=16.811502+3.202187=20.013689 GeV.

Approximately 20.0137 GeV.

Hmm, again, the options don't have this. So I'm confused because none of the options match around 20 GeV except option C (20.132 GeV) which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately without approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the rest mass. Let me check the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

The standard atomic weight of Li-6 is 6.0175693 u. But when considering the nucleus (only protons and neutrons), the mass is atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. The atomic mass includes the electrons, right? So for a neutral lithium atom, it has 3 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.0175693 u minus 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is 0.0005485799 u. So 3 times that is 0.0016457397 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.0175693 -0.0016457397=6.01592356 u.

So m c²=6.01592356 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

6.01592356 *931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.01592356 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.00592356 *931.494= let's compute:

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00092356 *931.494≈0.858 (since 0.0009 *931.494≈0.838, and the rest 0.00002356 *931≈2.19).

Wait, 0.00092356=9.2356e-4.

Compute 9.2356e-4 *931.494.

= (9e-4) *931.494 + (0.2356e-4)*931.494.

9e-4 *931.494=0.8383446.

0.2356e-4 *931.494= approx 0.2356 *0.931494≈0.2195.

So sum is 0.8383446 +0.2195≈1.0578446.

So total for 0.00592356 *931.494 is 4.65747 +1.0578446≈5.7153146.

So 0.01592356 *931.494 is 9.31494 +5.7153146≈15.0302546 MeV.

Wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait: 0.01 *931.494 is 9.31494 MeV.

Wait, no, 931.494 is in MeV per u. So 0.01 *931.494 MeV=9.31494 MeV.

Similarly, 0.00592356 *931.494 MeV is approximately 5.7153 MeV.

So sum is 9.31494 +5.7153=15.03024 MeV.

Wait, but wait, 0.01592356 is approximately 0.01592356 u, so 0.01592356 *931.494 MeV/u = approximately 15.03024 MeV.

So total m c² is 5588.964 MeV +15.03024 MeV=5603.99424 MeV=5.60399424 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.6040 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6040 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6040.

Let me compute 3 *5.6040=16.812.

0.57142857 *5.6040.

Compute 0.5 *5.6040=2.802.

0.07142857 *5.6040: 5.6040 *0.07=0.39228, 5.6040 *0.00142857≈0.008001.

So 0.39228 +0.008001=0.400281.

So 0.5 part is 2.802, 0.07142857 part is 0.400281, sum is 3.202281.

Adding to 16.812: 16.812 +3.202281=20.014281 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0143 GeV.

Wait, the options don't include this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me check.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

So (3.57142857 -1)=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.6040 GeV = ?

2 *5.6040=11.208.

0.57142857 *5.6040= ?

0.5*5.6040=2.802.

0.07142857 *5.6040=0.400281.

So sum is 3.202281.

So total K=11.208 +3.202281=14.410281 GeV.

But the question is about the energy of the collider, which is typically the total energy, not the kinetic. So the total energy would be around 20.014 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the atomic mass calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using the mass of the lightest nucleus, like using the mass of a proton plus neutrons, not considering the exact isotope's binding energy. But I think the correct approach is to use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact value without approximations. Let me try to compute 3.57142857 *5.6040.

3.57142857 × 5.6040.

Let me compute it as (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.6040.

3 ×5.6040 =16.812.

0.57142857 ×5.6040 = ?

Compute 5.6040 ×0.5 =2.802.

5.6040 ×0.07142857 ≈5.6040 × (1/14) ≈0.4002857.

So sum is 2.802 +0.4002857=3.2022857.

So total E=16.812 +3.2022857=20.0142857 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0143 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, 20.0143 is closest to option C (20.132), but that's 0.1177 GeV higher. Did I perhaps miscalculate gamma?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of gamma.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

That's correct. So maybe the issue is with the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0175693 u. Let me recompute m c² using 931.494 MeV/u.

So m c² =6.0175693 *931.494 MeV.

Compute this:

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0175693 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.0075693 *931.494.

Compute 0.007 *931.494=6.520458.

0.0005693 *931.494= approx 0.5284.

So sum is 6.520458 +0.5284=7.048858.

So 9.31494 +7.048858=16.363798 MeV.

So total m c² =5588.964 +16.363798=5605.327798 MeV=5.605327798 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.605327798 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.605327798=16.81598339.

0.57142857 *5.605327798.

0.5 *5.605327798=2.8026639.

0.07142857 *5.605327798= ?

Compute 5.605327798 *0.07=0.392372945.

5.605327798 *0.00142857≈0.00800235.

Sum: 0.392372945 +0.00800235=0.400375295.

So 0.5 part is 2.8026639, 0.07142857 part is 0.400375295. Sum is 3.203039195.

Adding to 16.81598339 gives E=16.81598339 +3.203039195=20.019022585 GeV.

So approximately 20.0190 GeV.

Wait, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again about the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the kinetic energy. Let's compute that.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.605327798 GeV.

Compute:

2 *5.605327798=11.210655596.

0.57142857 *5.605327798= same as before, 3.203039195.

So K=11.210655596 +3.203039195=14.41369479 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this either. So maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) and not the sum. Let me think. For Li-6, it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. The mass of each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass would be 6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV. But earlier calculations using exact atomic masses gave around 5.605 GeV. So if someone uses 5.628 GeV for m c², then E would be 3.5714 *5.628=?

3.5714 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628≈0.403.

So sum is 2.814+0.403=3.217.

Total E=16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

That's very close to option C (20.132 GeV). Hmm, that's getting close. So perhaps the problem uses the approximate mass of 6 nucleons at 938 MeV each, leading to m c²=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.5714 *5.628.

Compute 3.5714 *5.628.

Hmm, more accurately:

3.5714 *5.628 = ?

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628.

Compute 0.07 *5.628=0.394.

0.0014 *5.628=0.00788.

Sum: 0.394+0.00788=0.40188.

So 0.5 part is 2.814, 0.0714 part is 0.40188. Sum is 3.21588.

Total E=16.884 +3.21588=20.1 GeV.

That's approximately 20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. So perhaps the intended approach was to approximate the mass as 6 *938 MeV, leading to 5.628 GeV, and then E=gamma * m c²=3.5714 *5.628≈20.1 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation with precise atomic mass gives 20.019 GeV, which is not an option, but the intended approach uses the approximate mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in considering the nucleus's mass. Let me check.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0175693 u. The exact mass of the nucleus is 6.0175693 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Electron mass is 0.0005485799 u per electron, so 3 electrons would be 0.0016457397 u.

So the nucleus's mass is 6.0175693 -0.0016457397 =6.01592356 u.

Now, m c²=6.01592356 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute this:

6.01592356 *931.494.

Let me compute this accurately:

6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.01592356 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.00592356 *931.494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00092356 *931.494= approx 0.858.

So 4.65747 +0.858=5.51547.

So 0.01592356 *931.494=9.31494 +5.51547=14.83041 MeV.

So m c²=5588.964 +14.83041=5603.79441 MeV=5.60379441 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60379441.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5.60379441.

Let's compute it step by step.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.60379441.

Hmm, let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.00379441≈0.013485.

So sum is approximately 2.14285714 +0.013485=2.15634214.

Adding to the 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.15634214=20.013485 GeV.

So approximately 20.0135 GeV.

But again, this doesn't match any option. So perhaps the intended approach was to approximate the rest mass as 6 *938=5.628 GeV, leading to E=3.5714 *5.628≈20.1 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma was calculated incorrectly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the error is in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the problem is using the rest mass energy without considering the binding energy, i.e., using the sum of individual nucleon masses.

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass of proton: ~938.272 MeV/c².

Mass of neutron: ~939.565 MeV/c².

So total rest mass is 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = let's compute.

3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total=2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m c²=5.633511 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute this:

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511=?

Compute 5.633511 *0.07=0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857= approx 0.008047.

So sum is 0.39434577 +0.008047=0.40239277.

So sum for 0.57142857 part is 2.8167555 +0.40239277=3.21914827.

Adding to 16.900533 gives E=16.900533 +3.21914827=20.119681 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.120 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Perhaps the slight difference is due to more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

So, given that the options are rounded to four decimal places, option C is the closest. But wait, according to the exact calculation using the atomic mass, the energy is about 20.014 GeV, which isn't an option. But using the sum of nucleon masses gives about 20.1197 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without subtracting the electrons' mass, i.e., using the atomic mass directly as the rest mass. Let me try that.

Using atomic mass of Li-6 as 6.0175693 u, so m c²=6.0175693 *931.494=?

6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.0175693 *931.494=16.36 MeV.

So total m c²=5605.324 MeV=5.605324 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.605324.

3 *5.605324=16.815972.

0.57142857 *5.605324=3.203039.

So total E=16.815972 +3.203039=20.019011 GeV.

Again, not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The intended approach might be to calculate gamma as 3.5714 and m c² as around 5.6 GeV, leading to E≈20 GeV, but the exact calculation gives around 20.014 GeV. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps there's an error in the options, but among the given options, option C is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the relativistic energy formula but with beta as 0.96, leading to gamma of 3.5714, and m c² as, say, 5.604 GeV, giving E=20.014 GeV. But this is not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me compute that.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.5714, so gamma-1=2.5714.

Multiply by m c²=5.605324 GeV.

2.5714 *5.605324=?

2 *5.605324=11.210648.

0.5714 *5.605324=3.20304.

Sum is 11.210648 +3.20304=14.413688 GeV.

No, that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the rest mass of the entire atom, including electrons, but that would be larger than the nucleus. Let me see.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0175693 u. Including electrons, the rest mass is 6.0175693 u *931.494 MeV/u=5605.327 MeV=5.605327 GeV.

But then E=3.5714 *5.605327≈20.019 GeV.

Again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96c but in the lab frame, and perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reference frame. No, the problem states the speed is 0.96c, so I think the calculations are correct.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, based on the approximate approach of using the sum of nucleon masses, leading to E≈20.1 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done with beta = 0.96 and using gamma = 3.5714, and m c²=5.6 GeV, leading to E≈20 GeV, but the options may have a typo.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132. Let me compute 3.5714 *5.605378 (the earlier m c² value) precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.605378.

Let me compute it as 3.57142857 ×5.605378 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.605378 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.005378= approx 0.019265.

So sum is 2.14285714 +0.019265=2.16212214.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.16212214=20.01926499 GeV.

So E=20.01926499 GeV, which is approximately 20.0193 GeV.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation results in 20.132 GeV, which is option C. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation of gamma?

Wait, beta is 0.96, so gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is being treated as 6 *938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. So E=3.5714 *5.628=20.1 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV).

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the approximate rest mass.

Thus, the answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), and \( m c^2 \) is the rest energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( \beta = 0.96 \), we compute:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.0175693 \, \text{u} \). Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest energy is:
\[
m c^2 = 6.0175693 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5605.378 \, \text{MeV} = 5.605378 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.605378 \, \text{GeV} \), the total energy is:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.605378 \approx 20.0192 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy \( E \approx 20.0192 \, \text{GeV} \) does not exactly match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations in the rest mass or rounding differences in the problem setup.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
