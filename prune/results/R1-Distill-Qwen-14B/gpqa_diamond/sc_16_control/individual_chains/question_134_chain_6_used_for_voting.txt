Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to figure out the enthalpy change when these are mixed. Wait, but wait—HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other, right? That makes sense because acid-base reactions typically release heat, so the enthalpy change should be negative, indicating exothermic.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol) per mole of H+ from the acid. But wait, let me make sure—oh right, for strong acids and bases, it's approximately that value. Since HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, the neutralization should be pretty much complete and exothermic.

But wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. Each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. So that's something to consider. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 can provide two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2OH^-.

So the idea is to figure out how much acid and base we have in terms of H+ and OH- ions, then determine the limiting reactant, and calculate the total moles of H+ that are neutralized.

Let me jot down the details:

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = volume (L) * molarity. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 mol HCl gives 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. But H2SO4 is diprotic and strong, so it donates 2 H+ ions per molecule. So moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so moles of OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- to form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

So the total moles of H+ available are 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

The total moles of OH- available are 0.2 mol.

So the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. The OH- is the limiting reactant here because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 mol of OH- will react, and there'll be some H+ left over.

Wait wait, but maybe I should think about which acid's H+ is being neutralized. Wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid, each gives one H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each gives two. So when H2SO4 is present, perhaps each mole contributes two H+.

But when mixing the acids and the base, the total H+ is the sum of H+ from both acids.

So, the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 mol OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

So how much H+ is left? 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol. But wait, for the enthalpy of neutralization, only the H+ that reacts contributes to the heat released.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases about -57 kJ (or -13.6 kcal) if using kJ, or I think more accurately, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is taken as -57 kJ per mole of H+ (for strong acid and strong base). So for 0.2 mol H+ neutralized, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, C is -3.80 kcal, D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait a second, but wait the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. So the calculation needs to match the units.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the enthalpy per mole is in kcal. Because sometimes people use different units. Let me think, 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. So if each mole of H+ gives around -13.6 kcal, then 0.2 mol would be 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72 kcal. Wait, but that's positive, but the reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change is negative. So 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Hmm, option A is -2.72 kcal. But wait, that's the same as I get.

But wait, another perspective: The neutralization reaction would involve one mole of acid and one mole of base, but considering how many H+ and OH- they contribute.

Wait, but let me think again. The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH- to form 0.2 H2O. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, as I thought earlier, 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So none of the options directly match except perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, but wait another point: Did I account for all the H+ correctly? Let me recount.

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL *0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL *0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So moles of H+ available: 0.28 mol.

Moles of OH-: 0.2 mol. So OH- is limiting.

So 0.2 mol H+ will react with 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative) → -11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps the question expects me to calculate in kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should convert kJ to kcal. Because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ ≈ 0.2388 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal. That would match option A. But wait, no, because 0.2 mol *57 kJ is 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's the same as the first calculation. So the enthalpy would be -11.4 kJ or approximately -2.72 kcal.

But looking at the options, A is -2.72 kcal, and D is -16.0 kJ. So which unit is the question expecting?

The question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization', and the options have both units. So perhaps I should pay attention to the units in the options.

Option D is -16.0 kJ. How could that happen? Am I missing something in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let's recheck.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct. So the reaction is:

H+ (0.28 mol) + OH- (0.2 mol) → H2O (0.2 mol).

So 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react.

If each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ, then 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, but that's in kcal. Alternatively, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic, but the neutralization might involve two H+ per H2SO4.

Wait, but in the reaction, whether it's HCl or H2SO4, each H+ contributes the same. So the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

But wait, another idea: Maybe the limiting reagent isn't OH- but something else. Let me think, the reaction between the acids and the base would involve all the OH- reacting with the H+.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will completely dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the H+ from both acids is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ is in excess, so all OH- will react, and 0.28-0.2=0.08 mol H+ remains.

So the neutralization involves 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, leading to 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (ΔH per mole of H+ neutralized). So if ΔH is -57 kJ/mol, that's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL *0.3 M=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- = 0.2.

So 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH-.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is -11.4 kJ, approximately. So looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match, but none of the others do except perhaps if I convert to kcal.

Wait, the problem states the options in different units. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 cal =4.184 J; 1 kJ=1000 J, so 1000/4184≈0.2388 kcal). So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 *0.2388 ≈2.719 kcal. So that's approximately 2.72 kcal, which matches option A.

But wait, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So the answer should be either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

But wait, 0.2 mol H+ reacting with 0.2 mol OH- would produce 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 *57 kJ=11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy is negative, so -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Wait, let me look again. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same as 11.4 kJ (since 11.4 kJ ≈2.72 kcal). So perhaps the correct answer is A?

But wait, why would the question present the answer in kcal? Maybe I should double-check the standard enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as about -57 kJ/mol (H+), which is  approximately -13.6 kcal/mol. Because 57,000 J /4184 J/cal ≈13.6 kcal.

So 0.2 mol H+ neutralized would be 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

But wait, I thought the enthalpy per mole was -57 kJ, so why are we considering 13.6 kcal per mole?

Yes, because 57 kJ is 57,000 J, and 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57,000 J /4184 J/kcal ≈13.6 kcal. So that's correct.

So 0.2 mol H+ would release 0.2 *13.6 =2.72 kcal. So negative, -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, in the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, and option B is -11.42 kcal. So which is correct?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, in the reaction, the moles of H+ consumed are 0.2, so the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. So option A.

But I'm a bit confused because some sources might use just 57 kJ as the standard value, but the calculation in kcal would lead to this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total volume and concentration, but I don't think that's necessary. The enthalpy of neutralization per mole is fixed, so it's only the moles of H+ that matter.

Wait, another approach: The total moles of H+ available are 0.28. The total moles of OH- are 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All OH- reacts, taking 0.2 H+.

So the reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Molar basis: 0.2 mol H+ reacting.

Each mole of H+ gives -57 kJ, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

In kcal, that's -11.4 kJ * (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ -2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. What about the H2SO4? Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's mixed with a base, does it release two H+ ions? Oh wait, yes, because it's a strong acid, so both H+ ions dissociate.

So no, that's already accounted for in the H+ calculation.

So the correct answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But looking at the options, another option is B) -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Wait, because 1 kJ is approx 0.239 kcal, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So perhaps I messed up the unit conversion earlier. Let me be precise.

Wait, 1 kcal = 4,184 J.

So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. Divided by 4,184 J/kcal ≈13.6 kcal.

So 57 kJ =13.6 kcal.

So 0.2 mol *57 kJ/mol =11.4 kJ → 11.4,000 J.

To convert J to kcal: 11,400 J /4,184 J/kcal ≈2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong diprotic acid):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so total \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

Next, we compare the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ to determine the limiting reactant. The reaction is:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]  
The limiting reactant is OH⁻ because \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH}^- < 0.28 \, \text{mol H}^+ \). Thus, all \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH}^- \) will react, neutralizing \( 0.2 \, \text{mol H}^+ \).

The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized. Using the smaller unit of \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \):  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.
