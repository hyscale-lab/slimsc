Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors that affect the probability of this happening.

The question says that both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, I suppose, since orbital period depends on the distance from the star (using Kepler's third law). Also, both have circular orbits, which simplifies things a bit.

The stars are interesting. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but they have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses—so Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. That probably affects the star's gravity and the planet's orbit.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula I vaguely remember is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, maybe it's approximated as R_star / a_planet.

But wait, that's the geometric probability, right? The chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for us to see the transit. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) divided by something else? Or maybe it's just (R_star / a_planet). No, wait, I think the formula is (R*/a) * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it's just R*/a. Wait, no, maybe it's (R* + R_p)/a, but since R_p is negligible, it's approximately R* / a.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The probability P is given by (R*/a) * (1 / (b)), where b is the impact parameter. Oh wait, no, the impact parameter is the perpendicular distance from the star's center to the planet's path. When b is less than (R* + R_p), we see a transit. But the probability that b is small enough is what matters.

The maximum impact parameter for a transit is a (semi-major axis) times sin(i), where i is the inclination angle. For a transit, sin(i) must be greater than R*/a. So the probability depends on the distribution of inclinations. The probability that sin(i) is greater than R*/a is equal to the solid angle where that condition holds divided by the total possible solid angle.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula. The transit probability P is given by (R*/a) * (1 / (1 - (R*/a)^2))^(1/2)) * (something else?), or perhaps it's (R*/a) multiplied by some other factor. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R*) / a, assuming that the star's radius is much smaller than the semi-major axis. But considering that both stars have the same radius, R*, the probability would then depend inversely on the semi-major axis a.

Wait, no. Because the probability also depends on the star's size relative to the planet's orbit. So a larger a (more distant planet) would have a smaller transit probability because the chance of the orbital plane being aligned is lower. Because, imagine a planet far away—its orbit is a larger circle, so the angle it makes with our line of sight needs to be just right for a transit, which is less probable.

But wait, the probability P for a transit is approximately (R*/a) * (something). Let me look for the exact formula. Oh, right, the transit probability is given by:

P = (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2))) )

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about a simplified version. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will produce a transit is approximately (R*/a), assuming a is much larger than R*. But since both planets have different a values, we can compare their probabilities based on R*/a.

Wait, no, the probability is actually (R*/a) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2)) ), which comes from integrating over the possible impact parameters. But when R*/a is small, this simplifies to approximately (R*/a) * (1 + (R*/(2a)) ), but maybe for small R*/a, it's about (R*/a) multiplied by a factor close to 1.

Alternatively, another source I've read before says the transit probability is (R*/a) divided by (sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2))), which is the same as (R*/a) multiplied by 1/sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2). So this can be rewritten as (R*/a) * (1 / sqrt( (a² - R*²)/a² )) ) = (R*/a) * (a / sqrt(a² - R*²)) ) = R* / sqrt(a² - R*²).

Wait, but I'm not seeing this correctly. Let me think about it again. I think the exact formula for the transit probability when the star's radius is R*, planet's semi-major axis is a, and the angle is random is:

P = (R* / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R* / a)^2)) )

But when R* is much smaller than a, this is approximately (R* / a) * (1) = R*/a. So the probability is roughly proportional to R*/a.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same radius, so R* is same for both. Therefore, the transit probability would be higher for the planet with a smaller a (semi-major axis), because R*/a is larger when a is smaller.

So first, I need to find the semi-major axes of the two planets. But how?

We have the orbital periods and the masses of the stars. Using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M*)) a³, where M* is the mass of the host star.

So, a³ is proportional to (G M* P²) / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M* P²)^(1/3).

Given that, let's compare the semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Planet_1: M*1 = 2 M*, P1 = P (say, P is the period of Planet_2, so Planet_1's period is P/3, since its period is three times shorter. Wait, no: the question says Planet_1 has a three times shorter period than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

So, a1³ ∝ ( M*1 * (P1)^2 ) = (2 M*) * ( (P/3)^2 ) = 2 M* * (P² /9 ) = (2/9) M* P²

a2³ ∝ ( M*2 * (P2)^2 ) = (1 M*) * (P^2) = M* P²

So a1³ / a2³ = (2/9 M* P²) / (M* P²) ) = 2/9

Therefore, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.6 roughly.

Wait, 0.222 is about 0.222, so cube root is around 0.6 because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1/a2≈ 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. Alternatively, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 *0.6.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222: 0.63^3 is 0.25 (since 0.6^3=0.216, 0.63^3 is about 0.25). Wait, no, 0.63^3 = 0.63 * 0.63 * 0.63 = 0.63 * 0.63 = about 0.3969, times 0.63 is ≈ 0.250. But 0.6^3 is 0.216, and 0.62^3 is 0.62 *0.62=0.3844, *0.62=0.238. Oh, that's very close to 0.222.

So 0.62^3 ≈ 0.238, which is a bit higher than 0.222. So maybe cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.605. Let's say 0.605. So a1≈0.605 a2.

Thus, a1 is approximately 0.605 times a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R* / a. Since both stars have the same radius, R*, the probability for Planet_1 is (R*)/(a1) and for Planet_2 it's (R*)/(a2). So the ratio of P1/P2 is (R*/a1)/(R*/a2) )= a2/a1 = 1/(a1/a2) )= 1/0.605 ≈ 1.652.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because a1 is smaller, a1/a2 is 0.6, so R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2. So the transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

Wait, but let me recheck. a1 is smaller than a2. So a1 = 0.6 a2. Thus, a1 is smaller. So R* / a1 is larger, because a1 is smaller.

So the transit probability is higher for Planet_1. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, the options are: options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred with probabilities 1.65x and 2.7x. So according to our calculation, the ratio is approximately 1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

So the correct option would be option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me recap:

- Planet_1 has period P/3, star mass 2M, Planet_2 has period P, star mass M.

- Using Kepler's third law, a³ ∝ M * P².

- So a1³ = (2 M) * (P/3)^2 = 2 M * P²/9 = (2/9) M P².

- a2³ = M * P².

- a1³/a2³ = (2/9) => a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.605 a2.

- Transit probability P ∝ R*/a.

- Both stars have same R*, so P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) = 1/(0.605)≈1.65.

Which is about 1.65 times higher for Planet_1. So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher.

So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1, making option C correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's Third Law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1: \( M_{*,1} = 2M_* \), \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
- Planet_2: \( M_{*,2} = M_* \), \( P_2 = P_2 \)

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{*,1} P_1^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2} = \frac{2M_* \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_* P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
The researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
