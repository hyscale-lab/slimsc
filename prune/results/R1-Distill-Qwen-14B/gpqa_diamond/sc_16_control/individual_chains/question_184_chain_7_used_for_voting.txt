Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. Let me start by understanding what the target molecule is.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, okay. Let me break that down. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The numbering might be a bit tricky. Let's imagine the substituents: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement? Or maybe it's more about the order of substitution.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, their positions are adjacent in a meta arrangement, but wait, position 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), but position 3 is next to position 2? Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 would be adjacent in a sort of meta... No, wait, position 1 is next to 2 and 6, position 2 next to 1 and 3, position 3 next to 2 and 4. So in this case, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, which would make them adjacent in a way that ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, all three are adjacent in a row, but actually, in a benzene ring, that's a vicinal arrangement for ethoxy and tert-butyl, and then the nitro is next to the tert-butyl. Hmm, but wait, that might not be possible because each substituent is in a different position.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out. Let's imagine the benzene ring. If position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, then position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions, which would be a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro (since 1 and 3 are meta), but ethoxy and tert-butyl are adjacent (ortho). So, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro, each in adjacent positions.

Now, the problem is to find the correct sequence of reactions starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different reaction sequence. Each step would involve various reagents, which I remember are typical for electrophilic substitution reactions.

Let me think about the steps needed. We need to add three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Starting from benzene, which is an aromatic ring without substituents.

The order of substitution is important because the directing effects of the substituents will influence where the next group adds. Benzene is activated and can undergo electrophilic substitution. Once a substituent is added, the next substitution's position is determined by the directing nature of that group.

Each substituent is either activating or deactivating and ortho/para or meta directing.

Let's consider each substituent:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group because the lone pairs on the oxygen can donate electrons through resonance. It directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions relative to itself.

- tert-Butyl group (C(CH3)3): This is a bulky, activating (since it's an alkyl group) and ortho/para directing.

- Nitro group (NO2): This is a strong deactivating, meta directing group. It makes the ring less reactive but still can undergo substitution under forcing conditions.

We have three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So, the order in which we add them will determine the positions.

But wait, the target molecule has all three substituents. So, the first substitution will determine where the next goes, and so on.

Let me think about how the substituents are added.

Option A: The steps are i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), v) dilute H2SO4, vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (possibly hydrolysis?), vii) NaOH/EtBr (maybe ethoxylation via SN2?), viii) Fe/HCl (possibly reduction?), ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?).

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let me think step by step.

First, I need to figure out the order of adding substituents. Since nitro groups are deactivating, it's better to add them after activating groups, because once a nitro group is present, the ring is deactivated, making it harder to add other groups unless activating groups are already present.

Wait, but nitration is a strong reaction. Let me think: the first substitution is adding one group, then the second substitution adds another, and the third adds the last.

So, the order could be:

- Add ethoxy group first, which is activating and directs ortho/para.

- Then add tert-butyl group, again activating, but the position would be influenced by the ethoxy group.

- Then add nitro group. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so maybe it's better to add it after the activating groups have been added.

Alternatively, perhaps adding nitro first is not a good idea because it deactivates the ring, making it harder to add the other groups. But the target has a nitro group, so it's necessary.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the activating groups first, then add the nitro group, but that's not possible because nitro is a strong deactivating group. Once you add nitro, the ring is deactivated, and adding other groups becomes difficult. So, perhaps it's better to add the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups first, then nitro.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added first, but that would require more forcing conditions for the subsequent substitutions.

But let me think more carefully. Let's plan the steps:

1. Add ethoxy group: OCH2CH3.

2. Add tert-butyl group.

3. Add nitro group.

But the problem is that the nitro group is meta directing, so if we have an ethoxy and tert-butyl group on the ring, adding nitro would be influenced by these.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Maybe the nitro group is added first, but that would require the benzene to undergo nitration.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents and their directing effects.

If I first add a nitro group (step 1: nitration), the ring becomes deactivating and meta directing. So, the next substituent would add in the meta position relative to nitro. Then, the third substituent would depend on the directing of the existing groups.

But wait, the target molecule has substituents at positions 1,2,3. If I first add nitro, then the next substituent would go meta to nitro, which is position 4, but that's not where ethoxy and tert-butyl are in the target.

Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, let's try adding ethoxy first.

Step 1: Ethoxylation. Benzene + ethoxy group via, say, an etherification reaction. How would that happen? Typically, you can perform a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't for ethers. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation can be done, but for ethers, perhaps it's better to use a different method.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, but to get an ethoxy group, maybe we need a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a SN2 mechanism. Oh, but benzene isn't a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a side chain alkylation after a leaving group is attached.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction on a nitration or sulfonation product. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl bromide and AlCl3. But wait, Friedel-Crafts typically doesn't work for very bulky groups, but ethyl is not that bulky. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to give more para substitution, but with a good activating group, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly activating group, like a nitro group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the substituents and their order.

Optionally, since we need three substituents, the order of addition will determine their positions. Let me think about directing effects.

First substitution: Let's say we add ethoxy as the first substituent. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para directing. So the next substituent will go either ortho or para to ethoxy.

Second substitution: Add tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para directing, where would it go? It depends on where the previous substituent is.

Wait, if ethoxy is at position 1, then the tert-butyl could be added at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But in the target, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, after ethoxy (position 1), tert-butyl (position 2) would be ortho to ethoxy. Then, the next substituent, nitro, would have to be added in a position influenced by ethoxy and tert-butyl.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So, the substitution after adding nitro would be challenging.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added third, because once it's there, the ring is deactivated, but maybe the other groups have already been added.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order affects where they go. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Add ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) at position 1.

2. Add tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) at position 2.

3. Add nitro group (NO2) at position 3.

But how does that happen? Let me think about each step.

After step 1: benzene becomes ethoxybenzene (phenetole). Now, ethoxy is activating, ortho/para directing.

Step 2: Adding tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to have issues with bulky groups because of carbocation rearrangements. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl group is added via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the tert-butyl group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that might not be feasible due to carbocation stability. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a directing group to add the tert-butyl.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the order. Let me try looking at the options.

Looking at the options, all four have a sequence of reactions. Let's think about what each reaction step does.

Option A: starts with t-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So that would add the t-butyl group. Then nitration, then sulfonation, etc. Hmm, but the order of substitution would have the t-butyl as first substituent.

Option B: same first step, t-butyl alkylation, then nitration. Then Fe/HCl, which may be a reduction step for nitro groups, but that would not make sense if you're adding more substituents.

Wait, perhaps each option's steps are a bit convoluted, so I need to figure out which sequence leads to the correct substituent positions.

Let me think about when each substituent is added.

In the target, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Suppose we first add the ethoxy group.

But wait, in the options, most start with t-butyl alkylation. Let me check each option:

Option A's steps:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add t-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → possibly hydrolysis or acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 substitution to replace a leaving group with ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction, maybe of nitro to amine.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Wait, but that seems like multiple nitrations. That might not be correct.

Option B:

i) t-butyl alkylation.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iv) nitration again.

v) diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps the nitration steps here are adding two nitro groups, which is not what we want.

Option C:

i) t-butyl alkylation.

ii) sulfonation.

iii) nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) diazotization.

vi) nitration.

vii) hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

This seems to involve adding multiple nitro groups again. Not sure.

Option D:

i) nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) t-butyl alkylation.

iv) nitration.

v) diazotization.

vi) sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, nitrating first, then reducing nitro to NH2, then adding t-butyl, then nitrating again. That would lead to two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So, the correct option should include nitration only once.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is adding two nitro groups, which is not correct. So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine each step.

The target molecule has:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1.

- tert-butyl (C(CH3)3) at position 2.

- Nitro (NO2) at position 3.

So, substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions, all adjacent in a row.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky because each substitution's position depends on the existing substituents.

Let me think about how each substituent would be added.

First, perhaps adding the ethoxy group at position 1, then the tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and then the nitro at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl, but meta to ethoxy). Alternatively, but the directing effects might make that difficult.

Wait, but each substitution after the first is influenced by all the existing substituents. So, after ethoxy and tert-butyl are added, the nitro group's position would be influenced by both.

But perhaps the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the tert-butyl. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let me consider that.

If the first substitution is nitration, benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Nitro is meta-directing. Then, adding ethoxy group would go into the meta position relative to nitro. Then, adding tert-butyl would be influenced by both nitro and ethoxy.

Wait, but in that scenario, the substituents would be in positions 1 (nitro), 3 (ethoxy), and 5 (tert-butyl), which is not the target.

Alternatively, perhaps adding ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, after ethoxy and tert-butyl are added, the ring has two activating groups. Adding nitro next would be influenced by these.

So, let's consider that.

Step 1: Ethoxylation. Benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl. Where would that go? Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para directing. So, the tert-butyl could go ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to ethoxy.

If we want the tert-butyl at position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1, then that would be possible. So, during step 2, adding tert-butyl at position 2.

Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2) groups.

Step 3: Nitration. The next substituent (nitro) would be directed by the existing groups. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para. tert-butyl is activating, ortho/para. But where is the best position for the nitro group to attach?

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so once added, it's hard to add more groups. So, perhaps the nitro group is added last.

But in our case, the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2) and next to ethoxy (position 1 is at meta to position 3? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4. So, if ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3, the positions are 1,2,3, which are ortho to each other.

But ethoxy is at 1, which is ortho to 2, which is tert-butyl. But nitro at 3 is ortho to 2 and meta to 1.

Hmm, but when adding nitro, the directing would be influenced by both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

In the presence of multiple substituents, the most activating group may have a stronger influence. Ethoxy and tert-butyl are both activating, so the incoming nitro group would be directed by whichever is more influential.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is more likely to add in a position that is activated by both substituents.

Wait, but ethoxy is para to itself. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the positions.

After adding ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2), the ring now has substituents at 1 and 2.

The next step is to nitrate. So, where would the nitro group go?

The existing substituents are activating, so nitration would occur at positions activated by either substituent.

The ethoxy group at 1 directs to 2 and 4. But position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl. So, the next possible positions would be 4 (para to ethoxy) and positions adjacent to tert-butyl.

The tert-butyl at 2 directs to 1 (taken), 3, and 6.

So, possible positions for nitration are 3,4,6.

But the target has nitro at position 3, so let's see if that is possible.

If the nitro group is added at position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl, which is activating. So, that might be feasible.

But wait, the nitro group is deactivating. So, after that, adding another group would be difficult, but in our case, we're done after three substituents.

So, the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation → position 1.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → position 2.

3. Nitration → position 3.

But the question is, what are the reaction steps needed to achieve this?

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them start with ethoxylation. Instead, they all start with t-butyl alkylation.

Wait, option A's first step is t-butyl alkylation. Then, nitration. So that would add nitro group at a position directed by t-butyl.

Wait, if the first substituent is t-butyl (position 1), then nitration would occur in positions 3 or 5 (meta to t-butyl), since t-butyl is ortho/para directing but bulky so may favor meta? Or maybe para.

Wait, but t-butyl is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur at ortho or para positions. However, due to steric hindrance, para might be more favorable. So, nitration would occur at position 4.

Then, the next substituent would be ethoxy. Where would it go? The existing substituents are t-butyl (position 1) and nitro (position 4). Nitro is deactivating, meta directing. t-butyl is activating, ortho/para. So, the incoming ethoxy would be directed by both.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group. How is it added? Perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation again, but that's unlikely because the ring is already substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is attached. For example, if a nitro group is present, perhaps it can be converted into a good leaving group, like with H2SO4 to form a nitronium ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a nitro group is replaced with ethoxy, but that would require the nitro group to be present.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding the t-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about each option again.

Option B: i) t-butyl, ii) nitration, iii) Fe/HCl, which is a reduction (maybe reducing nitro to amine?), iv) nitration again, which would add another nitro group. But the target has only one nitro group. So that's probably not the right option.

Option C: i) t-butyl, ii) sulfonation, maybe adding a sulfonic acid group. Then, iii) nitration. Then, iv) Fe/HCl (reduction), v) diazotization, vi) nitration again. Hmm, again multiple nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option D: i) nitration first, making nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro to amine?), then t-butyl alkylation. Then, another nitration. But that would add two nitro groups, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the positions.

Suppose the first substituent is t-butyl (position 1). Then, the ring is activated, so next nitration would add to position 3 (meta to t-butyl) or position 4 (para). But since t-butyl is bulky, perhaps para is less favored, so nitration is more likely to occur at position 3.

So, second step: nitration adds nitro at position 3.

Now, the ring has t-butyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, the next substituent is ethoxy. Where would it go?

The existing substituents are t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta).

In the presence of both, the activating group directs more. So, ethoxy would be directed by t-butyl. So, possible positions are ortho (position 2 or 6) or para (position 4 or 5? Wait, t-butyl is at 1, so para would be position 4.

But the target has ethoxy at position 2. Hmm, maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added via a different method, such as introducing a leaving group and substituting.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an SN2 reaction, replacing a leaving group like a nitro group. But that requires the nitro group to be in a position that can leave.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro groups, the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group, such as a nitrate ester, then replaced with ethoxy.

Wait, but that's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the nitro group is in place, using a directing group.

Alternatively, maybe the order is: t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but then after t-butyl and ethoxy, the nitro group would have to be added. Let me think.

First substituent: t-butyl at position 1.

Second: ethoxy group. Ethoxy is activating, so it would be added ortho or para to t-butyl.

t-butyl is at 1. Ethoxy could go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). In the target, it's at 2, so that's good.

Third: nitro group. Now, the ring has t-butyl (1) and ethoxy (2). Both are activating, ortho/para directors.

In this scenario, where would nitration happen? It would be directed by the most activating group. Both are activating, but perhaps the ethoxy group is more activating.

So, ethoxy at 2 would direct to 1 (taken by t-butyl), 3, and 6.

t-butyl at 1 would direct to 2 (taken), 4.

So, the possible positions are 3 and 4 and 6.

But the target has nitro at 3, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 2) and meta to t-butyl (position 1).

So, if after adding t-butyl and ethoxy, nitration occurs at position 3, that would fit the target.

But how do we add nitro after ethoxy and t-butyl?

Because both are activating, the ring is activated, so nitration is possible.

But let's think about the steps:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl (position 1).

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add ethoxy? Wait, but ethoxy is an ether. Friedel-Crafts typically adds alkyl or acyl groups. Adding an ether directly via Friedel-Crafts is not straightforward because it's not an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but benzene isn't a good nucleophile. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method, such as using a tosylate or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, perhaps after the nitro group is added, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking back, all the options involve multiple steps, including sulfonation, nitration, diazotization, etc.

Option A:

i) t-butyl alkylation.

ii) nitration.

iii) sulfonation.

iv) diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that seems to involve multiple nitration steps. Hmm.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to NH2.

iv) nitration → another nitro group.

v) diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/heat → hydrolysis (maybe to phenol?).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, this seems to involve adding two nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonation.

iii) nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) diazotization.

vi) nitration.

vii) hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Again, multiple nitration steps.

Option D:

i) nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) t-butyl.

iv) nitration.

v) diazotization.

vi) sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O/heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

This would involve two nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add t-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But looking at the options, perhaps option C does something similar.

Wait, another approach: The target has substituents at 1,2,3. Let me imagine the order of addition:

1. Add t-butyl (position 1).

2. Add ethoxy (position 2).

3. Add nitro (position 3).

So, the steps would involve adding t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy after t-butyl? Because benzene is now substituted with t-butyl, which is activating, so ethoxy could be added via Friedel-Crafts, but ethoxy is not an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's not feasible with benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a directing group. For example, if a nitro group is present, but in that case, the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after the nitro group is in place. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, which is not present in this case.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about each step's reagents and what they do.

Looking at option C:

i) t-butyl alkylation → adds t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So, adds a sulfonic acid group (SO3H). That's a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, nitro group added, directed by t-butyl and sulfonic acid.

Wait, but after adding t-butyl and sulfonic acid, the ring is highly deactivated, so nitration might not be feasible unless under very strong conditions.

Then, iv) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group. So, adding two would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is more about activating and deactivating groups.

Wait, let's think of the steps in option B:

i) t-butyl alkylation.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitration again.

But that would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is option B, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the actual reaction steps.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's imagine the positions in a benzene ring.

Positions 1, 2, 3.

We need to add ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

The order of addition should be such that each substituent is added in a position directed by the existing groups.

Let me plan the steps again:

1. Add ethoxy at position 1: The first substituent is ethoxy. This activates the ring, directs ortho and para.

2. Add tert-butyl at position 2: Ortho to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro at position 3: Which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

But how to add the nitro group in the third step.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring is activated, so nitration should be possible.

But looking at the options, none of them show ethoxylation as the first step. All start with t-butyl.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a key point. Perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, which can act as a leaving group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution of a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions.

Wait, in sulfonation, you add a sulfonic acid group (SO3H) which is a strong meta director and deactivating. If you then want to substitute that group, perhaps you can use a nucleophilic substitution, but that's typically difficult on aromatic rings unless the leaving group is activated.

Wait, but in some cases, sulfonic acid groups can be replaced under basic conditions with a good nucleophile, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is present. For example, if a nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, which might be more reactive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Grignard reagent, but that doesn't fit with the given options.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this differently.

Looking for an option where ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction, perhaps via an SN2 mechanism, which would require a good leaving group. For example, if a nitro group is present, perhaps it's converted into a nitro compound that can leave, allowing the substitution of an ethoxy group.

Wait, for example, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine, which can then be converted into a diazonium salt, which can be displaced by a nucleophile like ethoxide.

So, the steps would involve:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize to form diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxide.

But let me think about that.

Wait, but the order of substitution would be: tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, perhaps the substituents are added in the order: t-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

So, let's think:

1. t-butyl alkylation → position 1.

2. Nitration → position 3 (meta to t-butyl).

3. Reduction of nitro at 3 to amine.

4. Diazotization → form diazonium chloride.

5. Substitution with ethoxide: using NaOH and EtBr perhaps? Or maybe via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but that would involve substituting the amine group with ethoxy.

Wait, but t-butyl is at 1, nitro at 3. Then, nitro is reduced to amine. Diazotization would require cold conditions (0-5°C), and then the diazonium salt is treated with a nucleophile.

But in this case, the ethoxide would substitute the diazonium group, replacing it with OCH2CH3.

So, if the nitro group is at position 3, after reduction, it's an amine at position 3. Diazotization would form a diazonium salt at 3, which is then replaced by ethoxy.

But that would make position 3 ethoxy, which isn't what we want. Because in the target, position 3 is nitro.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is not reduced but is instead used as a leaving group. But I don't recall a reaction where a nitro group is directly substituted via SN2.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a good leaving group via sulfonation. For example, converting nitro to nitroso, which can then leave as a diazonium salt.

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a nitrate ester, which can leave as a good leaving group.

But I'm not certain about the exact steps.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring is deactivated by a nitro group. But I think that's unlikely because nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings requires strong activating groups, which a nitro group isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an activating group that directs to the desired position.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So, perhaps after adding ethoxy via some other method, like using a nucleophilic substitution.

But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's not part of the options.

Hmm. This is getting quite tricky. Perhaps I should think about the order of reactions and which option matches.

Looking back, the target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in positions 1,2,3.

So, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add t-butyl (position 1) via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy (position 2) via Friedel-Crafts (but that's not possible because ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide). Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's hard.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the nitro group is present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is converted into a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro, the nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, which can act as a leaving group.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Grignard reagent, but that's not one of the steps in the options.

Hmm.

Let me try to evaluate the options again.

Option C:

i) t-butyl alkylation.

ii) sulfonation → adds SO3H group.

iii) nitration → nitro group added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) nitration → another nitro group.

But the target requires only one nitro group, so this is probably not correct.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitration → another nitro.

v) diazotization.

vi) hydrolysis → maybe to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps in this case, after adding ethoxy, the ring would have t-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C: i) t-butyl, ii) sulfonate, iii) nitrate, iv) reduce, v) diazo, vi) nitrate.

But again, seems like multiple nitro groups are added.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the substituent positions again.

The target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, when adding substituents, the order would be ethoxy → t-butyl → nitro.

But how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the t-butyl and nitro groups are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is present, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, but that's deactivating, making it hard to add other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add nitro first, then ethoxy, then t-butyl.

But then, nitro is deactivating, so adding ethoxy would require a good directing group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add ethoxy, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But in the options, the first steps are t-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me see.

Option B: steps are:

i) t-butyl alkylation → t-butyl at position 1.

ii) nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to t-butyl).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitration → another nitro group added. Wait, that's two nitro groups, which is not correct.

So, probably not.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitration → nitro at position 3.

iii) sulfonation → sulfonic acid at position 5? Or where?

iv) diazotization → maybe of a nitro group.

Wait, but after nitration, adding a sulfonic acid group would be deactivating, making further reactions difficult.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But looking at the options, perhaps option C.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) reduce.

v) diazo.

vi) nitrate.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing how that would place the substituents correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should consider the directing effects and reaction sequences.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy via a substitution.

So, steps:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl at position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to t-butyl).

3. Now, to add ethoxy. But the ring has t-butyl (activating) and nitro (deactivating). The ethoxy group needs to be added ortho to t-butyl, which is position 2.

How to achieve that?

Perhaps the nitro group is converted into a leaving group, allowing substitution with ethoxide.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine, then converted into a diazonium salt, which can be displaced by ethoxide.

So, steps after adding nitro:

a) Reduce nitro (position 3) to amine.

b) Diazotize the amine to form diazonium chloride.

c) Displace with ethoxide (SN2), replacing the diazonium group with ethoxy.

But wait, that would place ethoxy at position 3, which is not what we want. We want it at position 2.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution at position 2, but that would require a leaving group there, which doesn't exist in this case.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: Each reaction step in the options, let's see which option leads to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

The target is 2-(t-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Looking at option B:

Step i: t-butyl alkylation → t-butyl at position 1.

Step ii: nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to t-butyl, as t-butyl is activating and ortho/para, but due to steric, maybe meta).

Now, the substituents are t-butyl (1), nitro (3).

Step iii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (NH2 at 3).

Step iv: nitration → another nitro group? But that's not desired.

So, option B's step iv adds another nitro, which is incorrect.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C:

i) t-butyl alkylation → 1.

ii) sulfonate → let's say adds SO3H at position 4.

iii) nitration → where? Now, the ring has t-butyl (1) and sulfonate (4). Sulfonate is deactivating, meta-directing. t-butyl is activating, ortho/para.

So, the incoming nitro group would be directed by the activating t-butyl and the deactivating sulfonate.

Which position would that be? Perhaps position 2 (ortho to t-butyl, as it's more activating).

So, nitro at position 2.

Then, iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine at 2.

v) diazotization → form diazonium at 2.

vi) nitration → another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one.

Option D:

i) nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-butyl alkylation → t-butyl at position 2 (since the amine is activating and directs ortho/para). So, t-butyl could be at position 2 or 4.

Assuming it's at position 2.

iv) nitration → adds another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me try to outline:

i) t-butyl alkylation → position 1.

ii) sulfonate → position 4.

iii) nitration → where? t-butyl directs to 2 and 4 (para). But 4 is already taken by sulfonate. So, nitro would be at 2.

Now, substituents are 1 (t-butyl), 2 (nitro), 4 (sulfonate).

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro at 2 to amine.

v) diazotization → form diazonium at 2.

vi) nitration → adds another nitro, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

But in any case, I'm getting stuck and perhaps I should make a choice based on elimination.

The target requires adding ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in the correct positions. The correct order of addition is likely t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. But how to achieve that.

In the options, option C has steps that include sulfonation and nitration, which may complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual steps in option B:

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitration → another nitro.

v) diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxy substitution via SN2.

viii) sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

But without a clear path, I'm going to have to make an educated guess.

Based on the target, the substituents must be added in an order that allows each to be properly directed. The t-butyl group is bulky and would likely be added first, then ethoxy in the ortho position, then nitro in the meta to t-butyl or ortho to ethoxy.

But in the options, the only one that starts with t-butyl and then nitration is option A, B, C, and D.

Wait, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, let me think: option B's steps.

i) t-butyl alkylation → t-butyl at 1.

ii) nitration → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine at 3.

iv) nitration → another nitro group, which is not correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

After much deliberation, I think the correct sequence is option B. Because after adding t-butyl and nitro, the reduction and subsequent steps may allow for substitution of the nitro group.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the order of adding substituents and the directing effects of each group must be carefully considered. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The synthesis must proceed in a sequence that allows each substituent to be added in the correct position, considering the activating or deactivating nature and ortho/para or meta-directing effects of the existing groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Starts with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, sulfonation, and other steps.
   - The sequence involves multiple nitration steps and does not clearly lead to the correct substitution pattern.
   - Likely incorrect due to the complexity and lack of clarity in achieving the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, reduction of nitro to amine, and another nitration.
   - The addition of two nitro groups is problematic, as the target molecule contains only one nitro group.
   - This sequence does not align with the target structure.

3. **Option C**:
   - Starts with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, and another nitration.
   - The inclusion of sulfonation and multiple nitration steps complicates the synthesis and does not clearly lead to the desired product.
   - Likely incorrect due to the introduction of additional groups.

4. **Option D**:
   - Begins with nitration, followed by reduction, tert-butyl alkylation, and another nitration.
   - This sequence introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule containing only one nitro group.
   - Additionally, the order of adding substituents does not align with the required positions.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions must involve adding the tert-butyl group first, followed by the ethoxy group, and finally the nitro group. However, none of the options perfectly match this sequence. Among the given options, **Option B** appears to be the closest, as it starts with tert-butyl alkylation and nitration, which are critical steps in the synthesis. Despite the ambiguity in achieving the exact target structure, Option B is selected as the most plausible choice.
