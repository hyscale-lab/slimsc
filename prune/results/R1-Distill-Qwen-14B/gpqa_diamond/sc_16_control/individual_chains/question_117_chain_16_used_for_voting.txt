Okay, so I have this chemistry question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different physical properties like rotation of plane-polarized light.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. The nitro groups are at 6,6' and the ester groups are at 2,2'. So, each ring has substituents in specific positions. I remember that biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for cis or trans isomerism around the single bond. But wait, does that lead to optical isomerism? Oh, right, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some form of internal asymmetry. In biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical, they can have cis/trans isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. But whether they exhibit optical activity depends on whether there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, in this case, with the nitro groups on both rings and the ester groups as well, does the molecule have a center of symmetry? Let's see, if the two rings are mirror images but connected, would that allow for enantiomers? Or would the molecule be symmetrical itself? Wait, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it can have enantiomers. For example, in diphenyl compounds, if the substituents are such that the two rings are mirror images but the arrangement isn't symmetrical, then they can have enantiomers. So, for 6,6' dinitro and 2,2' diester groups, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because the substituents are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond. Wait, in biphenyl, 1,1' means the two phenyl rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a substituent at 2 and another at 6. The nitro groups are on 6, and the ester groups on 2. So each ring has two substituents. Now, could this arrangement lead to cis or trans isomerism? Because the biphenyl can rotate, but if the substituents are in certain positions, it might not be able to rotate into a mirror image. Wait, but for optical isomerism, do they need a chiral center or just a lack of a plane of symmetry? Wait, no, optical isomerism is about the presence of enantiomers, which requires the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry. So if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can have enantiomers. For example, if the substituents on each ring are different, or their arrangement leads to a lack of overall symmetry.

But in this case, the substituents on each ring are the same. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If that's the case, it would not have optical isomerism because it would be achiral, maybe.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged such that one ring has a nitro and ester in a way that on the adjacent ring, it's mirrored. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So maybe this compound doesn't show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, let me write that out. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Or is it HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that molecule has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So, the question is, does this compound have a chiral center? The central carbon (carbon 2) has OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Let me count the substituents. Carbon 2: attached to OH, a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups? No, wait. Let me think. The structure would be:

O
|
O-OCH3
|
COOCH3

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (the ester group)
|
CH(OH)CH3 ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the correct structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the three substituents on the central carbon (carbon 2) are: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. Wait, no, the central carbon would have four substituents. Let me think: the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, noâ€”if it's 2-hydroxy, then the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So it's HO-CH2-CH2-COO-. But then the ester would be HO-CH2-CH2-COO-OCH3. Wait, but that's the structure. So the molecule would have a central CH2 group attached to OH and another CH2 group attached to the ester. Wait, no: the structure is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH2-OH ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, that would be beta-hydroxy something. Alternatively, maybe I need to look at whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: the central carbon is carbon 2. Its substituents are:

- One CH2 group (from the OH),
- One CH2 group (from the COOCH3),
- An OH group,
- And a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached. So maybe the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, but that would make the central carbon (CH2) attached to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH2 between the OH and the COOCH3. Each of those carbons is a CH2. So the carbon adjacent to the OH is CH2, which is connected to OH, the next CH2, and the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let's think about the chiral centers. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, is there a chiral center?

If the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the carbon with OH has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? No, because it's CH3-C(OH)-..., wait no, that would be a ketone, but wait, the ester is on another carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the three carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)
2: CH2
3: COOCH3

Wait, but that doesn't provide a chiral center. Because the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, no, each CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH) would have substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, carbon can't have five bonds. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. That would mean four substituents: two CH2 groups, OH, and COOCH3. Wait, but two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. So in this case, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, wait a minute. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: another approach. It's an ester, so the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', where R is the alkyl from the acid. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one attached to OH and CH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. So that's four substituents, but two are the same (the two CH2 groups). Therefore, the central carbon is not a chiral center. So this compound doesn't have a chiral center and thus can't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. If you look at the molecule, it's symmetric around the middle carbon because both sides are CH2 groups. So, it's a meso compound, which is achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about another possibility? What if the structure is such that the central carbon is a chiral center. Let me see: for example, if the molecule is CH3CHOHCOOCH3. Then, the central carbon (the one with OH) would have substituents CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2 group? No, wait, in that case, it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, which would have four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent CH. Wait, but CH is not a substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can have optical isomerism. If not, it can't. So for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, does it have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, making the central carbon CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and two CH groups. No, wait, let me look. If the structure is indeed CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is the CH, which is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent CH (from the COOCH3 side). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me count substituents again. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the carbon with OH is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (which is a group),
- and the next carbon (the one in COOCH3 is a carbonyl, so that's a double bond, so the adjacent carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O).

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the substituents on the central carbon. If the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

1. CH3 group (left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 group (right),
4. and the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (which is a double bond, so maybe that's not a substituent). Hmm, maybe this is incorrect. Alternatively, I think the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is symmetric. So no chiral center.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back to this.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. Two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. Benzophenone is symmetrical because both phenyl groups are the same. The central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's a ketone. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. Therefore, it cannot have optical isomerism because it's symmetrical, so no chiral centers or other features causing asymmetry.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CHCH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CHCH-COOCH3. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Wait, no: actually, fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. Wait, noâ€”maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H (cis), and fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H? No, no, that's succinic acid. Wait, let me clarify. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, where the two -COOH groups are on the same side. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the two -COOH groups are on opposite sides. So, the dimethyl ester would be the same. Now, does this compound have stereoisomerism? Well, it's a diastereomer if you have E and Z isomerism. Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, it's the trans (E) isomer. But does it exhibit optical isomerism? Wait, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of asymmetry. Fumarate ester is a symmetrical molecule? Wait, no. The ester has groups on both ends. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, no, fumarate is across the double bond. Let me think: the structure of fumarate is CH2=CH with COOCH3 on each end. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, the trans isomer. So the dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, and the double bond is trans. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
||
O

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again: fumarate is the trans diastereomer of the dicarboxylic acid. So, for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, no. Let's clarify: fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester is (E)-diepoxypropane? No, wait. Fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. No, perhaps it's better to draw it as CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be succinate, not fumarate. Fumarate is CH2=CH with COOCH3 on each carbon. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond? No, wait, no. Fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in the trans configuration. So, both COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the question is whether dimethyl fumarate can have optical isomerism. So, does this molecule have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry? In this case, the molecule is not symmetrical. Because the substituents on each end are the same (both COOCH3), but the double bond is E, so the arrangement is trans. But wait, since the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because if you imagine a plane bisecting the double bond, the two halves would mirror each other. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, noâ€”because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same. So, for example, each carbon is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3OOC group. Wait, perhaps on each end, the substituents are the same. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (which is the trans isomer) doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another perspective. Fumarate has a double bond with substituents on either end. If the substituents are the same on both ends, like COOCH3, then the molecule could be symmetrical. So, in that case, it's not chiral. But wait, isn't that the case for all symmetric alkenes with identical substituents on each end? Yes, that's correct. So, in this case, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Suppose the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have a double bond with identical groups on both ends, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, yes, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about if the substituents are different? Then, the molecule would have stereoisomerism, possibly leading to optical isomerism. But in this case, substituents are the same, so no.

So, let's recap each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Earlier, I was confused about whether this compound is symmetrical or not. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they mirror each other, the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral. But if the arrangement isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral. Hmm, I think in this case, the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Because the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', and the ester groups are on 2 and 2'. So the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I thought it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is symmetric, making it a meso compound. So no optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but none of the compounds show optical isomerism? But that can't be right, because the options don't have an option with all 'no's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) would have substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH (from the next carbon). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the adjacent CH (from the COOCH3 side, which is a carbonyl, so perhaps it's not a substituent).

Wait, perhaps the central carbon has four different substituents. Let me list them:

If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon (CHOH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (left),
2. COOCH3 (right),
3. OH (as a hydroxyl group),
4. and the adjacent carbon (from the COOCH3 side), which is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but that's a double bond, so maybe that doesn't count as a substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH (from the CH2 group). Wait, I'm confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's not correct. I think I'm getting stuck, but perhaps compound 2 actually does have a chiral center. Because if the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent carbon (which is part of the carbonyl group, perhaps). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a substituent. Therefore, the central carbon would have substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen? No, because then it would be a chiral center. Wait, wait a minute. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, that would imply the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (but that CH is part of the CH3 group, so it's the same as the first substituent). No, that can't be. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is symmetric. So, the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to two CH2 groups (identical), so it's not a chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about this. Another possibility is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as methyl 2-hydroxy-2-propanoate, which would have the structure CH2(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CHOHCOOCH3. Wait, no, that's 3-hydroxy. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. If it's propanoate with hydroxyl on the second carbon, then the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, OH, and COOCH3. No, that can't be a chiral center because two substituents are the same. So, this compound does not have a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think differently. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central CH2 has two CH2 groups on either side, an OH and a COOCH3. So, this arrangement is symmetric. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so all four compounds don't show optical isomerism? But that's not possible because the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe I missed something with compound 4. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, so does that have E/Z isomerism. But does that lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, no, E and Z isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism (constitutional isomerism?), but it's not optical isomerism unless the molecule is chiral. So, unless the molecule has a chiral center or another form of asymmetry, it won't have optical isomerism. So, dimethyl fumarate, being a trans (E) isomer, is symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center?

1. No, due to symmetry.

2. No, due to symmetry (meso compound).

3. No, due to symmetry.

4. No, due to symmetry.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the options don't support that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, let's think about compound 4 again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but no, that's not correct. Fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me structure it correctly. Fumarate is the trans isomer of the diethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, each carbon on the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon has two identical substituents (COOCH3 and another COOCH3). Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about the possibility that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Yes, when you have identical substituents on each carbon of a double bond, the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so perhaps none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that can't be because the options don't have that as an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the compounds.

Let me go back to compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure has two biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Now, whether the molecule is symmetrical depends on the arrangement. If the substituents are on opposite sides of the central bond, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, since each ring has the same substituents (nitro at 6 and ester at 2), the molecule should have a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral, and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: if the substituents are arranged such that one ring's substituent is on the same face as the other's, but that might not necessarily make the molecule symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me try to think of other possibilities. Maybe I'm missing something about the substituent positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same face of the biphenyl rings, and the ester groups are also on the same face, but arranged in a way that doesn't mirror each other. In that case, the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but how are the substituents arranged? The way the question is phrased, it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, on each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2. Now, the positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other on the benzene ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are meta. Now, when connected to the biphenyl, the arrangement could lead to a symmetrical or asymmetrical structure.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl has the substituents arranged such that each ring has the nitro at 6 and the ester at 2, which are on opposite ends relative to the central bond. So, if the substituents on each ring are mirrored, the entire molecule would be symmetrical. Thus, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, perhaps none of the four compounds show optical isomerism. But that can't be right, as per the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. It's connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. So, substituents on the central carbon: two CH2 groups, OH, and COOCH3. Since two substituents are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, no chiral center. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the structure is different? Let's say it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Then, the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the adjacent CH (from the COOCH3 side, which is a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a double bond).

Wait, in that case, the substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen? No, that can't be because the adjacent carbon is part of the carbonyl group. So, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, making the central carbon (CHOH) connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent CH which is part of the carbonyl. Wait, but that CH is double-bonded to O, so maybe it's not a substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3. But that would imply a longer chain, which doesn't fit the name. The name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is an ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to two CH2 groups, so it's not a chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should conclude that none of the compounds show optical isomerism, but the options don't have that as an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center.

1. No chiral center.

2. No chiral center (symmetrical).

3. No chiral center.

4. No chiral center.

Wait, but that leaves no correct options. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of them.

Wait, let's think about compound 4 again. Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that can't be right. Wait, fumarate is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would be (E)-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in the trans configuration. Now, each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon has two identical substituents, so the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry? Yes, because each end is a mirror image. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing an option where only one of the compounds shows optical isomerism. But the given options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 1. Let me imagine the substituents on the biphenyl rings. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Now, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same face and the esters are on the same face, but opposite to the nitro groups. Then, the molecule could be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps in this compound, the substituents are such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So, dimethyl 6,6'dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'dicarboxylate would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought the substituents were arranged symmetrically. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are positioned in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if on one ring, the nitro is at position 6 and the ester at 2, and on the other ring, the nitro is at 6' and the ester at 2', but their arrangement around the central bond makes the molecule asymmetrical. For example, if the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents are not mirror images. I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

In any case, given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which options are more likely.

Looking at the options:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

But from my analysis, none of the compounds show optical isomerism. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon has four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is part of the carbonyl, so perhaps it's not a substituent. So, the substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen? No, that can't be because the adjacent carbon is double-bonded. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is symmetric. So, no chiral center.

Wait, but if it's CH3CHOHCOOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a CH from the adjacent group. But that CH is part of the CH3 group, so perhaps it's not a different substituent.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed to answer based on the most plausible options.

Looking at the options, option A is 1, 2, and 4. I thought 2 doesn't have optical isomerism. Option D is 1 and 2. But I thought neither 1 nor 2 have it. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Wait, if dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer and each end has COOCH3 groups, which are identical, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. So, I think none of them exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is that only one of them does.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the possibility that compound 2 is a meso compound. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer. Let me think about which of the four can have optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer, which is symmetrical, so no.

Compound 1: perhaps it's a chiral biphenyl derivative. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier, I thought it was symmetrical. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me consider that each ring has a nitro and an ester. If the nitro and ester are on the same face of the biphenyl, the arrangement could be asymmetric. So, the molecule would have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but in that case, how would the substituents be arranged? Because the question states that it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate, which suggests that the substituents are on the same side. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, looking back at the other compounds:

Compound 2: no, due to symmetry.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: no.

So, only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 1. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing another compound.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 2. Let me think again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and perhaps a hydrogen. If that's the case, then the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is symmetric. But perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, which is an asymmetric molecule with a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Ah, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify the nomenclature.

The IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be as follows: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, making it HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So, the structure becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's symmetric, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the name would be methyl 3-hydroxypropanoate, not 2-hydroxy.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

- Compound 1: possibly has optical isomerism if it's chiral.

- Compound 2: no.

- Compound 3: no.

- Compound 4: no.

So, only compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 1.

Hmm. Let me think again. Perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me imagine the structure. The two rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. Now, the positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other on each ring. So, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face (cis), the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if they're on opposite faces, it might be symmetrical.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the configuration of the substituents. It just gives the positions. So, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Given that, I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps the correct answer is that compounds 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a plane of symmetry?

- Compound 1: probably yes, making it achiral.

- Compound 2: yes.

- Compound 3: yes.

- Compound 4: yes.

So, none exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not an option.

Ah, wait! What about compound 4, dimethyl fumarate. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, but the molecule is symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, another perspective: only compounds with a chiral center or other forms of asymmetry show optical isomerism. So, perhaps none of them do, but the options don't support that.

In the end, I think I made a mistake in assessing compound 1. Perhaps it's chiral, thus showing optical isomerism. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I thought 2 and 4 don't.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 2 does have a chiral center. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of the carbonyl, so perhaps it's not a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's connected to a CH group, which is part of the COOCH3 group. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center at the OH-bearing carbon. But I'm not certain about the structure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that only compound 4 shows optical isomerism. But earlier, I thought it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer. Let me think about each option:

Option A: 1, 2, 4.

Option D: 1 and 2.

If I thought 1 has optical isomerism, and 2 doesn't, but perhaps I'm wrong about 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include that.

Hmm. I think I have to go with the option that includes only compound 4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which of the compounds have a center of chirality.

Compound 4: no.

Compound 1: perhaps yes.

So, perhaps option A includes 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality or asymmetry in their structures:

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and ester groups at positions 2 and 2'. The substituents on each ring are identical, and the molecule likely has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-CH(OH)-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The central carbon (bearing the hydroxyl group) is connected to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, COOCHâ‚ƒ, OH, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)â‚‚C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl. As a result, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CHâ‚ƒOOC-CH=CH-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical (two COOCHâ‚ƒ groups). Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, only **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds show optical isomerism. However, the options provided do not include an option where only Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Given the constraints of the options, the most plausible answer is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential error in the analysis of Compound 1.

Answer: A
