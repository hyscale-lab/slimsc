Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A through D, each with a different value.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance, or the decay length, is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), right? So the formula should be L = γ * β * c * τ. But wait, I think γ is the Lorentz factor. Or maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, another approach: the decay length can be calculated using the formula that involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But I think the key step is to find the lifetime τ. Because once I have τ, I can find the distance.

I recall that the lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, Γ is the energy width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy, so the mean lifetime τ is ħ/(Γ). Wait, or is it more precise to say τ = ħ/(Γ), considering Γ is the width which is the total decay rate's energy equivalent.

Wait, let me think about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. So, τ would have units of seconds when calculated correctly.

But wait, I think the exact relation is τ = ħ / (Γ/2). Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the width at half maximum. The uncertainty principle would be ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so if Γ is the uncertainty in energy, then Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that Γ is the total decay rate, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Hmm, I think I need to get this right. Let me check the formula in my mind.

The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Because Γ is the rate of decay, which has units MeV, and τ has units of seconds. Hmm, but ħ has units of GeV·s, so Γ (in GeV) multiplied by τ (seconds) gives GeV·s * s = GeV·s²? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But perhaps it's easier to convert all units to base SI units.

Wait, another approach. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / (Γ * c^2), but I'm not sure. Or wait, perhaps the correct formula is τ = ħ c^5 / (Γ m^2), no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should step back.

Alternatively, I think the formula is L = c * τ * β γ. Because the decay length is how far the particle travels before decaying, depending on its velocity. So L = v * τ, but v is βc, so L = β c τ. But then τ is the lifetime, so we need to find τ.

Wait, but τ is the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So to get the observed lifetime, we have to multiply by the Lorentz factor γ. Because from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so γ = E / (m c^2). Or wait, E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E_X / (m_X c²). But I need to compute γ.

But wait, let's think about what E_X is. E_X is 8 GeV. The mass of X is 1.2 GeV. So the relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So γ is E / (m c²). But since m is in GeV/c² units, and E is in GeV, the c² would cancel out, so γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is approximately 6.6667.

So, γ ≈ 6.6667.

Next, the velocity β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ? Wait, no, β is v/c, and for a relativistic particle, β is approximately 1 when γ is large, but let's compute it correctly.

Wait, the relationship between β and γ is γ = 1/ sqrt(1 - β²). So β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that.

Given γ=8/1.2= 6.6667.

So 1/γ² = (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/(400) = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/γ² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's calculate that. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. Let me think, 0.99^2 is 0.9801, which is less than 0.9775. Wait, no, 0.9887^2 is (approx) 0.9887*0.9887.

Wait, let's compute 0.9887 squared:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Approximate:

(0.98)^2 = 0.9604.

But 0.9887 is 0.98 + 0.0087.

Using binomial expansion:

(0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2 *0.98 *0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.0173 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97777569, which is very close to 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, but wait the value 0.9775 is less than 0.977775, so the square root would be slightly less than 0.9887. Let's say approximately 0.9886.

So β is approximately 0.9886.

Now, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / (Γ), but wait, what are the units?

Γ is given in MeV. ħ is in GeV·s. So I need to convert Γ to GeV.

Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) )= (6.582e-25 / 0.320) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that:

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because Γ is the decay width, which is E * τ ≈ ħ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. So perhaps τ is ħ divided by Γ, yes.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) ) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying, which is v * τ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the observed lifetime is γ τ. Therefore, the decay length L is v multiplied by gamma tau.

So L = v * gamma * tau.

v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, let me write that again. L = beta c gamma tau.

But wait, beta is v/c, so L = beta c gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

Alternatively, since gamma is the Lorentz factor, and beta is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), so L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but I've already computed beta as approximately 0.9886, gamma as approximately 6.6667.

So putting it all together:

L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Compute each term:

beta ≈ 0.9886

gamma ≈ 6.6667

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute step by step.

First, compute gamma * beta.

gamma = 6.6667, beta ≈0.9886.

gamma * beta ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9886 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9886.

Calculate that:

6 * 0.9886 = 5.9316

0.6667 * 0.9886 ≈ 0.6584.

So total is approximately 5.9316 + 0.6584 = 6.59.

Wait, but 6.6667 * 0.9886: let me compute more accurately.

6.6667 * 0.9886:

Let me compute 6 * 0.9886 = 5.9316.

0.6667 * 0.9886 ≈ 0.66 * 0.9886 = let's compute 0.66 * 0.9886.

0.6 * 0.9886 = 0.59316.

0.06 * 0.9886 = 0.059316.

So total is 0.59316 + 0.059316 = 0.652476.

So 6.6667 * 0.9886 ≈ 5.9316 + 0.652476 ≈ 6.584076.

So gamma*beta ≈ 6.5841.

Now, L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute each part.

First, compute (gamma * beta) * c = 6.5841 * 3e8 m/s = 1.97523e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau: 1.97523e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

1.97523e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97523 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

First, compute 1.97523 * 2.056875.

Approximately:

1.97523 * 2 = 3.95046.

1.97523 * 0.056875 ≈ Let's compute 1.97523 * 0.05 = 0.0987615.

1.97523 * 0.006875 ≈ approximately 0.01357.

So total is 0.0987615 + 0.01357 ≈ 0.11233.

So adding to 3.95046 gives 3.95046 + 0.11233 ≈ 4.06279.

So the product is approximately 4.06279e-15 meters.

Wait, that would be 4.06279e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my calculation got approximately 4.06e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of 1.97523e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 1.97523e9 = 1.97523 * 10^9.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 10^-24.

Multiplying them:

(1.97523 * 2.056875) * 10^(9-24) = (approx 4.06279) * 1e-15 = 4.06279e-15 m.

So that's 4.06279e-15 m, which is about 4.063e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me see if I made any calculation mistakes. Let me recompute the 1.97523 * 2.056875.

1.97523 * 2.056875. Let me do this more accurately.

Break it down:

2.056875 = 2 + 0.056875.

1.97523 * 2 = 3.95046.

1.97523 * 0.056875:

Let me compute 1.97523 * 0.05 = 0.0987615.

1.97523 * 0.006875 = 0.01357.

Wait, 0.006875 is 11/1600, which is 0.006875. So 1.97523 * 0.006875 = ?

1.97523 * 0.006 = 0.01185138.

1.97523 * 0.000875 = approx 1.97523 * 0.0008 = 0.001580184; 1.97523 * 0.000075 = 0.00014814225.

Adding those: 0.001580184 + 0.00014814225 ≈ 0.001728326.

So 0.01185138 + 0.001728326 ≈ 0.0135797.

So 1.97523 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.0987615 + 0.0135797 ≈ 0.1123412.

So total is 3.95046 + 0.1123412 ≈ 4.0628012.

So 4.0628012e-15 m.

The options show option B as 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation would yield a slightly higher value, maybe because my approximations for beta and gamma were rounded.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma and beta more accurately.

Let me recompute gamma and beta more precisely.

Gamma is E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.666666..., which is 20/3.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m_X^2)/(E_X^2)).

Because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4.

But for beta, since beta = v/c = (pc)/(E/c) ) * c^2? Wait, no, beta is (pc c) / (E), since p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X^2)/(E_X^2)) ).

m_X = 1.2 GeV/c².

E_X =8 GeV.

So m_X^2 /E_X^2 = (1.44)/(64) ) = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Using a calculator approach: 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*(0.98)(0.008) + 0.000064 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

But 0.988^2=0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. So what's 0.9887^2?

Wait, let's compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Break it down:

(0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.017148.

0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Adding them together: 0.9604 + 0.017148 = 0.977548, plus 0.00007569 gives 0.97762369.

But our value is 0.9775, which is slightly less.

So, 0.9887^2 = 0.97762369 which is higher than 0.9775. So the sqrt of 0.9775 is slightly less than 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps 0.9886^2:

Compute 0.9886^2 = ?

(0.98 + 0.0086)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0086 + 0.0086^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0086 = 0.98 * 0.0172 = let me compute: 0.98 * 0.01 = 0.0098, 0.98 * 0.0072 = 0.007056. So total is 0.016856.

0.0086^2 = 0.00007396.

Adding together: 0.9604 + 0.016856 = 0.977256 + 0.00007396 = 0.97732996.

Close to 0.9775, but still less.

So 0.9886^2 = ~0.97733, which is less than 0.9775.

Compute 0.9886 + delta)^2 = 0.9775.

So:

(0.9886 + d)^2 = 0.9775.

Expanding: 0.9886^2 + 2*0.9886*d + d^2 = 0.9775.

We know 0.9886^2 is 0.97733.

So 0.97733 + 2*0.9886*d + d^2 = 0.9775.

Subtract 0.97733: 2*0.9886*d + d^2 = 0.00017.

Assuming d is small, d^2 is negligible.

So 2 * 0.9886 * d ≈ 0.00017.

d ≈ 0.00017 / (2 * 0.9886) ≈ 0.00017 / 1.9772 ≈ approx 0.0000858.

So beta ≈ 0.9886 + 0.0000858 ≈ 0.9886858.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

So, more accurately, beta is approximately 0.988686.

So gamma is 6.666666... and beta is approximately 0.988686.

So gamma * beta = 6.6666667 * 0.988686 ≈ Let's compute this accurately.

6 * 0.988686 = 5.932116.

0.6666667 * 0.988686 ≈ 0.66 * 0.988686 = 0.652386 plus 0.0066667 *0.988686≈ 0.006591.

So 0.652386 + 0.006591 ≈ 0.658977.

So total gamma * beta ≈ 5.932116 + 0.658977 ≈ 6.591093.

So, gamma * beta ≈ 6.591093.

Now, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So:

6.591093 * 3e8 m/s = 1.977328e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 1.977328e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is 1.977328e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977328 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977328 * 2.056875:

Let me compute this more accurately.

2.056875 = 2 + 0.056875.

1.977328 * 2 = 3.954656.

1.977328 * 0.056875.

Let me compute 1.977328 * 0.05 = 0.0988664.

1.977328 * 0.006875 = ?

0.006875 is 11/1600.

1.977328 * 0.006875 = 1.977328 * (11/1600).

Compute 1.977328 * 11 = 21.750608.

Divide by 1600: 21.750608 / 1600 ≈ 0.013594129.

So 1.977328 * 0.056875 = 0.0988664 + 0.013594129 ≈ 0.1124605.

So total is 3.954656 + 0.1124605 ≈ 4.0671165.

So L ≈ 4.0671165e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So 4.067e-15 is closer to option B, which is 4.0655e-15. So the correct answer must be B.

Wait, but why is the exact calculation giving me approximately 4.067e-15, while option B is 4.0655e-15? Could I have made a miscalculation in gamma * beta?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more precisely.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

1.2^2 = 1.44.

8^2 = 64.

So 1.44/64 = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9886855.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.9886855.

Compute 20/3 = 6.6666666667.

6.6666666667 * 0.9886855.

Let me compute this accurately.

6 * 0.9886855 = 5.932113.

0.6666666667 * 0.9886855.

Compute 0.6666666667 * 0.9886855.

0.6666666667 * 0.9886855 = approximately 0.66 * 0.9886855 = let's compute 0.6*0.9886855=0.5932113, 0.06*0.9886855=0.05932113. So total is 0.5932113 + 0.05932113 = 0.65253243.

So gamma * beta = 5.932113 + 0.65253243 ≈ 6.5846454.

So with this, gamma * beta ≈6.5846454.

Now, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau = ħ / Γ_X.

Wait, let me recompute tau with exact numbers.

Γ_X is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So now, L = 6.5846454 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.5846454 * 3e8 = 1.9753936e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.9753936e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9753936 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9753936 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this accurately.

First, compute 1.9753936 * 2 = 3.9507872.

Then 1.9753936 * 0.056875.

Compute 1.9753936 * 0.05 = 0.09876968.

1.9753936 * 0.006875.

0.006875 = 11/1600.

1.9753936 * 0.006875 = ?

Compute 1.9753936 * 0.006 = 0.0118523616.

1.9753936 * 0.000875 = 0.0017285368.

So total for 0.006875 is 0.0118523616 + 0.0017285368 = 0.0135808984.

So 1.9753936 * 0.056875 = 0.09876968 + 0.0135808984 = 0.1123505784.

So total 1.9753936 * 2.056875 = 3.9507872 + 0.1123505784 = 4.0631377784.

So L = 4.0631377784e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.063e-15 m.

The options:

Option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So our calculation is approximately 4.063e-15, which is very close to option B's 4.0655e-15. The difference is about 2.5e-16, which is within the realm of possible calculation rounding.

So I think the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean lifetime, with \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The energy of the particle is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.988686
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.320 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \gamma = 6.6667 \times 0.988686 \approx 6.5911 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 6.5911 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, compute \( 6.5911 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.97733 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s} \). Then multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (1.97733 \times 10^9) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The computed decay length \( L \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).
