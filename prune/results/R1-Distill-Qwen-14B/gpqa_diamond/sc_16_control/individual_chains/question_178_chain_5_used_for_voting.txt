Okay, so I'm faced with this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian: L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant is important for renormalizability. A renormalizable theory has all the interaction terms with coupling constants that have mass dimension ≤ (4 - the dimension of the interaction term). Or wait, maybe I should think about the superficial degree of divergence. Oh right, the superficial degree of divergence formula is D = d + (E_fermion * (3/2)) + (E_boson * 1) - L_coupling * (mass dimension of the coupling). Wait, no, I think the formula is D = d - (sum over each field's dimension) for the term. Alternatively, each derivative is dimension 1, and each field contributes its dimension.

Wait, another approach: The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So for L_int, which is a part of the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension 4. So let's break down the components.

Looking at the term κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, what's the dimension of each field?

In 4D, the Dirac spinor ψ has dimension 3/2 because the Dirac equation is (∂/i + ... )ψ = 0, so ψ has dimension 3/2. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, no, F is from the gauge field, which has dimension 1. Because the gauge field A_μ has dimension 1, since it's like a derivative (each derivative is 1, and A appears in ∂ + A, so A must match ∂, which is dimension 1). The field strength F is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so it's dimension 2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The gauge field A has dimension 1. So F, which is ∂A, has dimension 1+1=2. Correct.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices and the commutator of γ matrices. Since each γ matrix is dimensionless (they're just matrices with no mass dimension), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless.

So the term is κ times ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2) times σ_{μν} (dim 0) times ψ (3/2) times F^{μν} (dim 2). So let's calculate the dimensions:

ψ̄ has 3/2, ψ has 3/2, F has 2. So together, the fields contribute 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4. And sigma is 0, so κ must contribute the remaining to make the whole term have dimension 4.

Wait, the entire term is a product of these, so the dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}]. Wait, because σ is dimensionless, so:

dimension of term = [κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 2.

But each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Because the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [mass]^4 in 4D. So:

[κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4.

Wait, let me compute that: 3/2 + 3/2 is 3. 3 + 2 is 5. So 5 + [κ] =4. So [κ] must be -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait: Another approach. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, each term must have dimension 4. So the term κψ̄ σψ F must have dimension 4.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ give 3/2 each. F is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus F's 2 gives 5. So the term is (κ) * 5 = 4? So κ must have [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So yes, [κ]_M = -1. So first part, the dimension is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the interaction terms have coupling constants with mass dimension ≤ (4 - d), where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, I think for a term with n fields, the coupling's mass dimension must be ≥ (d - (sum of fields' dimensions)). Wait, it's the other way around. Let me think again.

In 4D, for a term in the Lagrangian to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ (number of fields' dimensions) -4. Or wait, each term in the Lagrangian must have a coupling's dimension such that the term is renormalizable.

Wait, a term is renormalizable if the coupling has positive or zero mass dimension. Because in 4D, a term with dimension (d=4), the condition for renormalizability is that the sum of the fields' dimensions (including derivatives as fields) plus the coupling's dimension is ≤ 4.

Wait, the general rule is that the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ (d - (sum of field dimensions)). So for a term to be renormalizable in 4D, the sum of the fields' dimensions plus the coupling's dimension must be ≤ 4. Because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: Each interaction term in the Lagrangian that's renormalizable must have a coupling with mass dimension ≥ (d - (sum of field dimensions)).

In this case, the interaction term has coupling κ, and the fields are ψ, ψ, and F. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Wait, ψ̄ is spinor, ψ is spinor, F is bosonic field.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2.

So the sum of field dimensions is 3/2 +3/2 + 2 = 5.

The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so the coupling κ must have dimension [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1.

So the coupling dimension is -1. Now, the mass dimension of the coupling being negative implies what? Because in 4D, for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have dimension ≥ (4 - (sum of field dimensions)). Let me compute that.

Sum of field dimensions: 3/2 +3/2 +2 =5. So 4 -5 = -1. So for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ -1.

In this case, the coupling has dimension exactly -1. So it's on the boundary. But wait, does that mean it's renormalizable?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The general condition for a term to be renormalizable is that the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ (d - (sum of the fields' dimensions)). For example, in 4D, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So for each term, [coupling] + sum[field dimensions] =4.

So [coupling] =4 - sum[field dimensions].

If [coupling] is positive, the term is renormalizable. If it's negative, it's non-renormalizable.

In this case, sum[field dimensions] is 5, so [coupling] =4 -5= -1. Which is negative. Hence, the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the term in the Lagrangian has the form L = g φ^k, etc., and the condition is that the coupling g must have dimension ≥ (d - (k * [φ])) for scalar fields. But for spinor fields, the dimension is 3/2 each.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of derivatives in the interaction term. A renormalizable interaction has a finite number of derivatives, and each derivative adds dimension 1.

Wait, but the given term doesn't have any derivatives. So the term is dimension 5 in the fields and coupling, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so coupling must be -1.

But the coupling's dimension is negative, which implies that the interaction term is of higher order, meaning the theory is non-renormalizable. Because interactions with coupling dimension <0 would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait: I remember that a term is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension ≥ (d - (sum of the fields' dimensions)). So for our case, d=4.

sum of the fields' dimensions is 3/2 +3/2 +2 =5. So 4-5= -1. So [coupling] must be ≥ -1. Since our coupling is exactly -1, which is the minimum, does that mean the theory is renormalizable?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. The term in the Lagrangian is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2.

So sum of field dimensions is 3/2 *2 +2=3+2=5.

So [L] = [κ] +5=4 (since each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4). So [κ] =-1.

For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling must have mass dimension ≥ (d−sum of fields). Which here is 4−5=−1.

So [κ] is −1, which is exactly the threshold. So it's renormalizable?

Wait, but wait. The rule is that any term in the Lagrangian with coupling dimension [g] ≥ (d − (sum of field dimensions)) is renormalizable. Because if [g] is positive, the term is renormalizable. If [g] is negative, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, the condition is that [g] must be ≥ (d − (sum of fields' dimensions)).

In this case, [g]=-1, which is equal to (4-5)= -1. So this is the lower limit. So the term is marginal (i.e., renormalizable) if [g] ≥ (d − sum), which in this case it is equal, so it's exactly on the boundary. So the term is marginal, implying the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: The superficial degree of divergence is given by D = d - (sum of fields' dimensions) + [coupling].

Wait, I think the formula for superficial degree of divergence is:

D = d - (sum of each field's dimension) * (n_i) ) + [coupling term's dimension] * (m), where n_i is the number of each field, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the renormalization conditions. For a term to be renormalizable, all the loops in the Feynman diagrams must be finite. Or, in terms of the coupling's dimension, a coupling with positive or zero mass dimension (i.e., [g] ≥0) would be renormalizable, while negative dimensions would require an infinite number of terms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

In our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, why? Because a coupling with negative dimension implies that the interaction is relevant or irrelevant. Wait, no, in 4D, a coupling with positive dimension is relevant (so the theory is renormalizable), and negative dimension is irrelevant (non-renormalizable). So [κ]=-1 <0, so the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it all together. The mass dimension of κ is -1. The theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has negative dimension.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable (incorrect because coupling is -1)

Option D: [κ]=1, which is wrong.

So correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for a gauge field has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from the commutator of $\gamma$ matrices, which are dimensionless. Hence, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = [\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

The total dimension of the fields is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, the coupling $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all interaction terms in the Lagrangian have couplings with mass dimension $[g] \geq 0$. In this case, the coupling $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is non-renormalizable, as it would require an infinite number of counterterms to cancel divergences.

### Step 4: Final conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

### Analysis of options:
- **A)** Incorrect: $[\kappa]_M = -1$ is correct, but the theory is not renormalizable.
- **B)** Incorrect: $[\kappa]_M = 1$ is incorrect, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **C)** Correct: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **D)** Incorrect: $[\kappa]_M = 1$ is incorrect, and the theory is not renormalizable.
