Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Alright, let me try to break it down.

So, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's an interesting form. I know that wave functions must satisfy certain conditions, especially normalization. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

But wait, the problem states that when measuring the position, none were found outside the interval x=1 to x=3. Oh, so the wave function must be zero outside this region. Does that mean the wave function we're given is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3? Or is it that the wave function is such that the probability is zero outside this interval?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "none were found at x<1 and x>3". So the probability of finding the particle outside 1 to 3 is zero, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that's a complex wave function. Oh, but the square of the absolute value would make the probability real. So maybe the given wave function is only valid in the region where x is between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The wave function is a function that can be complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

But for the wave function to be correctly normalized, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because outside that region, the wave function is zero, so the integral over all x would just be the integral from 1 to 3.

So first, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1. Then, solve for 'a'.

Let me write down ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

The absolute square |ψ(x)|² would be ψ*(x) * ψ(x). So let's compute that.

ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate, which would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i.

So when I multiply ψ and ψ*, I get:

[(a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2] + [i terms that cancel out because they're imaginary when multiplied by -i and so on? Or perhaps I should compute it properly.

Wait, let's compute it step by step. (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i).

That's equal to (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (a/sqrt(1+x))*(0.5i) - (0.5i)*(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, when you have (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B². So A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is 0.5i. So the product is A² - (B)^2.

So A² is (a²)/(1+x), and B squared is (0.5i)^2 which is (0.25)(i²) = (0.25)(-1) = -0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx is the integral of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

We can split this integral into two parts: integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: a² * integral from 1 to3 of 1/(1+x) dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluated from 1 to3.

At x=3: ln(4), x=1: ln(2). So the integral is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

This must equal 1, because it's the total probability. So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

So a² ln(2) = 0.5

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then, a is the square root of that. Let's calculate sqrt(0.7213).

Wait, 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Oh, that's really close. So a ≈ 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I calculated |ψ(x)|², I correctly expanded it as A² - B², right?

Yes, because (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 - (0.5i)^2.

Which is a²/(1+x) - (0.25)(-1) = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral is correct. Then the integrals from 1 to3 for each part.

Yes, the first integral is correct, leading to a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a²= (0.5)/(ln 2) ≈ (0.5)/(0.6931)=0.7213.

Square root of 0.7213 is approx 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is correct.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x) \psi(x)
\]

The complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying \( \psi(x) \) and \( \psi^*(x) \), we get:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 - (0.5i)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as the particle is never found outside this interval. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \)

For the first integral, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \). Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results, the total integral is:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
