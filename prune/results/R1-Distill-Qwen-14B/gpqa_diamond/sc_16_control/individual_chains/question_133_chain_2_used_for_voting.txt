Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have 200 cm³ of a solution containing 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. Right, because H3PO4 can donate three protons, so the different forms are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- form, I believe.

So, we have two salts here: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me write down their dissociations. 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- (and water, but that probably doesn't matter here).

So, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution. I remember that these can interconvert based on the pH of the solution. The phosphate buffer is usually around pH 7 or so, but the exact pH depends on the ratio of the two species.

Wait, but since we're looking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, then calculate the concentration from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the moles of each component, find their concentrations, and then use the Ka2 value to relate H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Let me think. The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So first, I'll calculate the moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 136.09. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the molecular weight would be 177.99 g/mol. So 1g is about 0.005613 moles.

So, in solution, the H2PO4^- concentration comes from KH2PO4: 0.00735 mol in 0.2 L (200 cm³ is 0.2 L). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait: the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

Similarly, the concentration of HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

Wait, but these are the initial concentrations before any reaction. Now, the phosphate ions can react with each other. So the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The reaction between them is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

The acid dissociation here would be for H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2- and H+. The Ka for this reaction is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be applied. The equation is pH = pKa + log ( [base] / [acid] )

Wait, wait, in this case, which is the acid and which is the base? H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base). So, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be:

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

We can calculate [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] from the moles we have, but wait, because the solution may not be at equilibrium yet. So, the concentrations will adjust based on the pH.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, maybe the simplest approach is to use the initial concentrations to compute the pH, and then find the ratio of the species at that pH.

So, let's proceed.

Calculate [H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

So, taking the ratio [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] = (0.028065) / (0.03675) ≈ 0.764.

Take the log of that: log(0.764) ≈ -0.116.

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2: Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.116) = 7.092.

Hmm, so the pH is approximately 7.09.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but when the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be in a certain ratio based on the pH.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the actual concentration of HPO4^2- at this pH.

Wait, wait a second. The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M. But when you mix them, the solution will adjust to a certain pH, which affects the ratio of these two species.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(pH - pKa2).

But wait, in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log (base/acid). So, when I rearrange, base/acid =10^(pH-pKa).

In this case, base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

So, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But wait, when we mix the two, the pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations.

Wait, but I think the initial approach is correct. Using the initial concentrations, we calculate the pH, then use that pH to find the actual concentrations of each species.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in a certain ratio determined by their initial moles, but adjusted by the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a buffer solution and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio, then compute the concentrations.

The total concentration of phosphate species would be the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and other forms, but since we're dealing with a buffer with Ka2, the other species (like H3PO4 and PO4^3-) are negligible. So, we can approximate that [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ total phosphate.

But wait, no, because the total amount of phosphate is the sum of all its forms, but in this buffer system, the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, then find the actual concentrations based on the initial moles.

Wait, considering that the solution is 200 mL, the total moles of phosphate would be the sum of the moles from both salts.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.00735 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005613 mol.

So total moles of phosphate (as H2PO4^- + HPO4^2-): 0.00735 + 0.005613 = 0.012963 mol.

The total volume is 0.2 L, so the total concentration of phosphate is 0.012963 / 0.2 = 0.064815 M.

Now, in the buffer, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (n_HPO4^2- / n_H2PO4^-) * ( [HPO4^2-]_initial / [H2PO4^-]_initial ) * something? Wait, maybe I should model it as:

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (n_HPO4) / (n_H2PO4) * (10^(pH - pKa2)).

Wait, this is getting a bit complex. Let me think. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, rearranged, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But I don't know the pH yet. So, alternatively, I can consider that the ratio of the initial concentrations is (0.028065)/(0.03675) = 0.764, as before. Taking the log gives log(0.764) ≈ -0.116, so pH = pKa2 + (-0.116) = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.

So, pH is approximately 7.092.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(7.092 - 7.208) = 10^(-0.116) ≈ 0.764.

Wait, that's the same as the initial ratio. So does that mean that the initial concentrations are already at equilibrium, and no shift has occurred? That doesn't seem right, but perhaps in this case, the solution's pH is such that the ratio is exactly the same as the initial, meaning that the concentrations don't change upon mixing. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you mix the two, the solution might adjust the pH, but if the initial concentrations are in the correct ratio for the buffer, then maybe the pH remains as if they were in separate solutions.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations are not in the same ratio as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation requires. Let me think again.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the ratio at equilibrium. So, perhaps when you mix the two, the concentrations will adjust to reach equilibrium based on the pH. So, the initial concentrations are not the equilibrium concentrations.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me approach it differently. Maybe I should consider the solution as a buffer solution and find the concentrations of HPO4^2-.

The total concentration of phosphate (as H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) is 0.064815 M.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] = a, and [HPO4^2-] = b.

From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

And the total concentration is a + b = 0.064815.

But I don't know the pH yet. Wait, but I can calculate it using the initial concentrations and then check if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of a.

From the Henderson equation, b = a * 10^(pH - pKa2).

But without knowing pH, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the buffer system defines the pH based on the ratio of the concentrations. So, using the initial concentrations, I can compute the pH, then use that to find the actual concentrations.

Wait, but I calculated the pH as 7.092 using the initial ratio. So, using that pH, I can compute the ratio again, which should be the same as the initial ratio, meaning that the initial concentrations are already at equilibrium. So, perhaps I can proceed by using the initial concentrations as the equilibrium concentrations.

But wait, that would mean that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028065 M, but that doesn't account for any possible shift when the two are mixed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe not. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentrations can change based on the buffer capacity. But perhaps in this case, the concentrations don't change much because it's a buffer solution.

Wait, perhaps the buffer solution's pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

So, if I calculate the pH as 7.092, then the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(7.092 - 7.208) = 10^(-0.116) ≈ 0.764.

Which matches the initial ratio of 0.028065 / 0.03675 = 0.764.

So, in that case, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- in solution are exactly the same as their initial concentrations after mixing, because the ratio is already correct.

Which would mean that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028065 M.

Wait, but the answer options are way lower than that, like 6e-7 M, which is much smaller. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something about the phosphate species.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate refers to the PO4^3- ion? No, no, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, the problem states to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

But according to my initial calculation, the concentration is 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But the options are way smaller.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly.

Wait, perhaps the solution is more complex because HPO4^2- can further deprotonate to PO4^3-.

Wait, but given the pH of 7.09, which is above the pKa2 of 7.208, I think HPO4^2- is the dominant form. Wait, wait, no, pKa2 is 7.208. So at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2, the H2PO4^- should be the dominant form. Wait, no, because pH is lower than pKa2, so the acid (H2PO4^-) is favored.

Wait, that would mean that [H2PO4^-] is higher than [HPO4^2-], which matches our initial concentrations.

But the question is the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but according to my initial approach, the concentration is about 0.028 M, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phosphate can hydrolyze further. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the initial moles wrong. Let me double-check.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.00735 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but when you mix them, the solution's volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are 0.03675 M for H2PO4^- and 0.028065 M for HPO4^2-.

But wait, maybe the problem wants the concentration of PO4^3-? No, the question specifically says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration after considering the dissociation of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the buffer equation should account for that. So, if the solution is a buffer, the concentrations are as per the initial values, because they are in the correct ratio.

But again, that gives a concentration of HPO4^2- of about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but the options are of the order 1e-7 M. So that's a big discrepancy. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I'm calculating the moles. Let me recalculate.

Molar mass of KH2PO4: K is ~39.1, H2 is 2, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So total is 39.1 + 2 + 30.97 + 64 = 136.07 g/mol. So yeah, 1.00 g / 136.09 = 0.00735 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is ~23 each, so 2*23=46. Then HPO4 is H (1) + P (30.97) + O4 (64) → 95.97. Then 2 H2O is 2*(2+16)=36. So total is 46 + 95.97 + 36? Wait, wait, no: the formula is Na2HPO4 · 2H2O. So the molar mass is:

Na2: 2 * 22.99 = 45.98

HPO4: H (1.008) + P (30.97) + 4 O (16*4) = 1.008 +30.97 +64= 96.008.

2 H2O: 2*(2*1.008 + 16) = 2*(2.016 +16) = 2*18.016 =36.032.

So total molar mass is 45.98 +96.008 +36.032 = 45.98 +132.04 = 177.02 g/mol (close to the given 177.99, perhaps rounding differences). So 1.00 g / 177.02 g/mol ≈ 0.005648 mol.

So 0.005648 mol of HPO4^2-.

So, in 0.2 L, that's 0.02824 M.

Again, about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options provided.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the question. Let me read the problem again.

The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, but the solution volume is 200 cm³. So, perhaps when you mix these two solids in 200 cm³, the volume isn't exactly additive. But the problem states the volume is 200 cm³, so I should proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is not HPO4^2-, but PO4^3-. But no, the term orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the concentration of PO4^3-? But that's the polyphosphate ion. No, the question is about orthophosphate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the hydrolysis of the salts, but perhaps I'm supposed to consider the third dissociation step. Because when HPO4^2- is in solution, it can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

But Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, which is very small. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, but the question is about HPO4^2-, so perhaps this isn't relevant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the buffer pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total concentration of HPO4^2- is not just the initial concentration, but includes some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in that case, the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- and H+.

The equilibrium would be H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

So, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

Let me denote x as the change in [H+]. Wait, but perhaps it's better to set up the equilibrium expression.

Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+] / [H2PO4^-].

But without knowing [H+], I can't directly solve this. However, if I know the pH, I can find [H+], which is 1e-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Wait, because pH is 7.092, so [H+] = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So, plugging into the Ka2 equation:

6.2e-8 = ( [HPO4^2-] * 8.21e-8 ) / [H2PO4^-].

So,

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * [H2PO4^-]) / (8.21e-8) )

= (6.2 /8.21) * [H2PO4^-]

≈ 0.755 * [H2PO4^-].

So, [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.755 * [H2PO4^-].

But in the solution, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03675 M, so [HPO4^2-] would be about 0.755 * 0.03675 ≈ 0.0278 M.

Which is very close to the initial concentration of 0.028065 M, so perhaps my initial assumption was correct that the concentrations don't change much.

But again, this would give [HPO4^2-] as approximately 0.028 M, which is not among the answer choices.

So I must be missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, but considering that some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of Na2HPO4, but perhaps I should account for the hydrolysis of the salt.

Wait, Na2HPO4 is a salt that can hydrolyze in solution. Its hydrolysis would produce HPO4^2- and OH-.

But wait, the hydrolysis equation for HPO4^2- is:

HPO4^2- + H2O ↔ H2PO4^- + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka3.

Wait, Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-12 ≈ 5.56e-3.

So, Kb is about 5.56e-3.

Then, the concentration of OH- can be found from this.

Wait, but if I consider this, then the solution would be basic, but earlier I found the pH to be around 7.09, which is slightly acidic. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- will lead to a pH around 7.09, which is slightly acidic because H2PO4^- is the acid form, and HPO4^2- is the base.

Wait, but if HPO4^2- can hydrolyze to produce OH-, and H2PO4^- can donate a proton, the overall pH is determined by the buffer system.

So, perhaps another approach is to calculate the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, I think I've already done that. The problem is that the calculated concentration is way higher than the options given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-? But the question says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 M 

C)2.81e-7 M

D)3.97e-7 M 

All are around 1e-7 M. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Maybe the moles are not as I thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let me recalculate.

Molar mass of KH2PO4:

K: 39.10

H2: 2.02

P: 30.97

O4: 64.00

Total: 39.10 + 2.02 +30.97 +64.00 = 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Na: 22.99 *2 =45.98

HPO4: H:1.008, P:30.97, O4: 64.00 → 1.008 +30.97 +64= 96.008.

2H2O: 2*(2*1.008 + 16.00) = 2*(2.016 +16) = 2*(18.016) =36.032.

Total:45.98 +96.008 +36.032 = 177.02 g/mol.

So 1.00 g /177.02 g/mol ≈ 0.005648 mol.

So, that gives [H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

[HPO4^2- ]= 0.005648 /0.2 = 0.02824 M.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the solution is about the concentration of PO4^3-? Let's see.

The third dissociation step is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, [H+] is 1e-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-].

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02824) / (8.21e-8).

= (5.083e-14) / (8.21e-8) ≈ 6.19e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

But the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

So, this can't be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but again, the initial concentrations already account for that.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the solution involves the use of the ionic equation considering all the possible dissociations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations using the charge balance.

The solution must satisfy charge balance: sum of cations = sum of anions.

The cations are K+ (from KH2PO4) and Na+ (from Na2HPO4).

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of K+.

Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives 2 moles of Na+.

So, moles of K+ = 0.00735 mol.

Moles of Na+ = 0.005648 mol * 2 = 0.011296 mol.

Total cations: 0.00735 + 0.011296 = 0.018646 mol.

Anions: HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- and any others.

Each HPO4^2- contributes 2- charge. Each H2PO4^- contributes 1-.

So, total negative charge = 2*[HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] + [OH^-].

Positive charge is [K+] + [Na+] = 0.018646 mol.

So, 2 [HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] + [OH^-] = 0.018646 mol.

But in solution, [OH^-] is related to pH. At pH 7.09, [OH^-] is 1e-7 + 7.09 → pOH = 14 -7.09 =6.91 → [OH^-]≈ 1.23e-7 M.

So, 2 [HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] = 0.018646 - [OH^-] → 0.018646 - 1.23e-7 ≈ 0.018645 mol.

But from the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.764.

So, let me denote [H2PO4^-] = x.

Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 x.

Total phosphate = x + 0.764 x = 1.764 x = 0.064815 M (from earlier calculation).

Wait, no. Wait, the total phosphate is x + 0.764 x = 1.764 x = 0.064815 M.

So, x = 0.064815 / 1.764 ≈ 0.03673 M.

Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 * 0.03673 ≈ 0.02807 M.

Again, same as before. So, [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M.

But the options are way smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-? Let me see.

The concentration of PO4^3- would be (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+}.

As before, that's approximately 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me read the question again: "the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution".

Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-. So, the correct answer should be around 0.028 M, but that's not an option.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is not a buffer, but involves considering the hydrolysis of both salts.

Wait, perhaps both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociate in solution, but their products can further react.

Wait, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

The Ka for this is Ka2 =6.2e-8.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the solution is to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the concentration considering that both salts contribute to the same ion.

Wait, but I'm not seeing where the error is. All my calculations point to a much higher concentration than the options provided.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration assuming that all HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, that would be a different approach. Let me try that.

So, initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03675 M.

The dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

Assuming that x is the concentration of HPO4^2- formed, so [HPO4^2-] = x.

Then, [H+] = x.

So, Ka2 = (x)(x) / (0.03675 - x) ≈ x² / 0.03675.

Because x is small compared to 0.03675, we can approximate 0.03675 - x ≈ 0.03675.

So, x² = 6.2e-8 * 0.03675 ≈ 2.28e-9.

x = sqrt(2.28e-9) ≈ 4.775e-5 M.

Which gives [HPO4^2-] ≈ 4.78e-5 M, which is 4.78e-5 M, which is 4.78e-5 M, which is 4.78 x 10^-5 M. But again, this is way larger than the options given.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution as a result of the buffer system, but considering that some of it comes from both salts.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would lower the concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3-, which would be in the 1e-7 range.

But the question is about orthophosphate, not phosphate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the buffer equation and the pH determined by the initial concentrations.

Wait, pH is 7.09, so using pKa2 of 7.208, the HPO4^2- concentration is calculated as:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Wait, Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+] / [H2PO4^-] → [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/ [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03675 M.

[H+] is 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So, [HPO4^2- ] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03675) / 8.21e-8.

= (6.2 * 0.03675) / 8.21 * (1e-8 /1e-8 )

= (0.22875) /8.21 ≈ 0.02787 M.

Again, around 0.028 M.

Not matching the options.

At this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Another possibility: perhaps the solution involves considering that the two salts form a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but the problem is that the initial concentrations are not the same as the equilibrium concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and so the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is determined by the pH, while the total concentration is the sum of both.

So, let's set up the equations.

Let [HPO4^2-] = b, [H2PO4^-] = a.

From the Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log(b/a)

The total phosphate concentration is (a + b) = 0.064815 M.

We know pH is 7.09, pKa2 is 7.208.

So, 7.09 =7.208 + log(b/a) → log(b/a)= -0.118 → b/a = 10^(-0.118) ≈ 0.764.

So, b = 0.764 a.

And a + b = 0.064815.

Substituting b:

a + 0.764 a = 0.064815 → a (1 + 0.764) = 0.064815 → a = 0.064815 / 1.764 ≈ 0.03673 M.

Then, b = 0.764 * 0.03673 ≈ 0.02807 M.

Again, same as before.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.02807 M.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of PO4^3-? Because that would be much smaller.

PO4^3- concentration is given by Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+}.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

[H+] is 8.21e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.21e-8).

= (5.0526e-14) / (8.21e-8) ≈6.15e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.15e-7 M, which is option A: 6.24e-7 M.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

So, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is the concentration of PO4^3-.

But that would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement and the question is asking for PO4^3-.

But the question clearly states orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-). So, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that it can accept a proton from water, but that would make it H2PO4^-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by considering the solution as a buffer and find the concentration based on the initial moles and the buffer equation.

But all my methods point to the same answer, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the actual correct answer is 6.24e-7 M, which would correspond to the PO4^3- concentration.

But I'm not sure.

In that case, the answer would be option A:6.24e-7 M.

But that's just a guess because the correct approach gives [HPO4^2-] as 0.028 M, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution volume is 200 mL, but I'm miscalculating the concentration.

Wait, no, the concentration is moles divided by volume in liters. So 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M, which seems correct.

Hmm, I'm at a loss here. Perhaps the correct answer is option D:3.97e-7 M.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the expression [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-}) / [H+].

But earlier calculation gives that as 0.028 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and that the concentration of HPO4^2- is (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume + volume from dissolution?), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration after considering that some of the HPO4^2- is converted to H2PO4^- and PO4^3-.

But given that, the concentration would still be around 0.028 M.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the concentration of HPO4^2- should be approximately 0.028 M, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is 6.24e-7 M, corresponding to the PO4^3- concentration.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and apply buffer equilibrium principles. The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, with molecular weights of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Initial concentrations in the solution
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{0.00735 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.03675 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.028065 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Buffer equilibrium and pH calculation
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The equilibrium constant for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄ is Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and its corresponding pKa₂ is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(\text{Ka}_2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}\right)
\]
Substituting the initial concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.028065}{0.03675}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092
\]

### Step 4: Total phosphate concentration
The total concentration of phosphate species (H₂PO₄⁻ + HPO₄²⁻) is:  
\[
[\text{Total Phosphate}] = \frac{\text{Total Moles of Phosphate}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.00735 + 0.005613}{0.200} = 0.064815 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Ratio of HPO₄²⁻ to H₂PO₄⁻
From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} = 10^{\text{pH} - \text{pKa}_2} = 10^{7.092 - 7.208} = 10^{-0.116} \approx 0.764
\]
Let \([\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = x\). Then:  
\[
[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = 0.764x
\]
\[
x + 0.764x = 0.064815 \implies 1.764x = 0.064815 \implies x \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = 0.764 \times 0.03673 \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 6: Discrepancy with answer options
The calculated concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is approximately \(0.028 \, \text{M}\), which is much higher than the options provided (\(10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)). This suggests a misunderstanding of the question or a misinterpretation of the term "orthophosphate." If the question instead refers to the concentration of PO₄³⁻ (a much smaller species), we can calculate it using:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄}^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
Given \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.21 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot 0.02807}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]
This matches option **A** (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

### Conclusion
The question likely refers to the concentration of PO₄³⁻ rather than HPO₄²⁻. Based on the calculations, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).
