Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism, also known as optical activity. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Let me think through each of the compounds given and determine if they exhibit this property.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers. Let's take each compound one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. So it's a biphenyl structure with substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6, and carboxylate groups (as methyl esters) at position 2 on each ring. For biphenyls, I think that if the two rings are connected in a way that allows for different configurations around the central bond, that could lead to isomerism. But wait, optical isomerism requires the molecule to be chiral. So does this structure have a chiral center?

Wait, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a carboxylate group (O-CO-OCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. The biphenyl is connected as [1,1'], so the two rings are connected at their 1 positions. Now, considering the substituents, are there any chiral centers here?

Let's see. The central bond connects the two rings. If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule isn't symmetric, maybe there's a possibility of cis and trans arrangements. But wait, biphenyls can have different conformations (like coplanar or twisted), but that's more about conformational isomerism, not stereoisomerism.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents could be on either side. Oh, wait, the two rings each have two substituents. Let me think about the substituents: the positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Are the substituents arranged in such a way that they can create a chiral center around the central bond?

Wait, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group. The arrangement around the central bond would matter. For instance, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to each other, or opposite. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring create a chiral center on the central carbon. Wait, no, because the central bond is between two carbons from each ring, but each of those is part of a benzene ring, which is sp² hybridized. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded or part of a ring.

Wait, maybe the biphenyl system can have axial chirality. I remember that when two rings are connected, the way the substituents are arranged around the central axis can lead to axial isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't be mirrored, then the compound would be chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. Let me imagine the benzene rings. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. On each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering on biphenyls is such that the two rings are connected at the 1 position, and the numbering goes around each ring. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So on each ring, the nitro group is at position 6, which is adjacent to the connection point (position 1). So the substituents are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro) on each ring. 

So when connected, the substituents on each ring could be arranged such that the nitro groups are on the same side, leading to a certain configuration, or on opposite sides, leading to another. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe this molecule can exist as enantiomers because the arrangement of substituents on each ring creates a chiral axis.

I think that in biphenyl systems, especially when the substituents on each ring are such that they can't be mirrored, the compound can exhibit axial chirality. So if each ring has substituents that can't be overlapped by their mirror image, then yes, there would be optical isomerism.

So the first compound might show optical isomerism because of the arrangement of substituents leading to a chiral axis. But wait, or is there a possibility of symmetry? Let me think: if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, maybe the whole molecule is symmetrical. Like, if each ring has the same groups but arranged such that the entire molecule is symmetric, then it wouldn't be chiral.

Wait, in this case, the substituents on each ring are both at 2 and 6 positions, which are meta to each other. Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So that's two substituents on each ring, in the para positions relative to the point where the rings are connected. Wait, no. Because if the rings are connected at position 1, then position 2 is adjacent, and position 6 is across from that. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other on that ring. So each ring has two substituents, one at position 2 and one at 6. Are these positions across from each other on the ring?

Wait, benzene rings have six positions. So if the connection is at position 1 of each ring, then on each ring, position 2 is adjacent, and position 6 is two positions away from the connection point. Let me draw this mentally. So, for one ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So 2 is ortho to 1, and 6 is meta to 1. Wait, no. Because positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 1 and 3 are meta, and 1 and 4 are para. So position 6 on the ring would be equivalent to position 2 on the other side, right? Because benzene is cyclic.

Wait, if the ring is numbered clockwise, then position 2 is next to 1, and position 6 would be the next one after 5, which is across from 2. So, position 2 and 6 are para to each other on each ring. So on each ring, the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) are para to each other.

Wait, then each ring has two substituents in the para positions. So each ring is, in effect, symmetrical in that case. Because if substituents are para, the ring has two substituents in exact opposite positions. So in that case, each ring would have a plane of symmetry. Then, when considering the entire molecule, would it also have a plane of symmetry?

Hmm. Wait, maybe the biphenyl is connected in such a way that the substituents on each ring are directly across from each other, leading to a symmetric molecule overall. If that's the case, then the molecule wouldn't be chiral and wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should move on and come back to this.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid. So the structure is OCH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, no, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

So the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the parent. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COO-OCH3. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. The 2 position would be the middle carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH(CH3)-COO-OCH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So methyl ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon (the second carbon), so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate has three carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then CH2-CH2. Or wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but then the structure would have a chiral center at the second carbon. Because the carbon with the hydroxyl group is connected to COOCH3, two CH2 groups, and an OH. Wait, no, wait: the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups: CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups (wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the adjacent carbon to the COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2(OH)CH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH3CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to a hydroxyl, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group. That would make it a chiral center because four different groups are attached: OH, CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, the second carbon is in the middle. So the groups on that carbon are: OH, CH3 (from the adjacent CH2?), COOCH3, and another CH2 group. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the structure could be like this: the propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, and the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So if the middle C has a hydroxyl group, it would be connected to: COOCH3, two CH2 groups (but wait, the middle carbon can't be connected to two CH2 groups). Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is the middle one, which has a hydroxyl group, two CH2 groups (one on each side), and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, that makes four different groups attached to the second carbon: OH, the COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups which are attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, each CH2 group is attached to the adjacent carbons. So, no, each of those CH2 groups is on either side of the central carbon. So, the central carbon has four different groups: OH, COOCH3, a CH2CH3 (from one side) and a CH3 (from the other side?) No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, because propanoate is three carbons. The structure would be HO-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate? Or wait, the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, in this case, the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups: COOCH3, two CH2 groups (one on each side), and the OH group. Wait, but each side is a CH2? So that would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, in that case, the central carbon has the groups: (1) COOCH3, (2) OH, (3) CH2CH3 (if the other end is a CH2CH3?), no, no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Because propanoate is CH3CH2COOCH3, so the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CHOH connected to CH3 and COOCH3. So, what groups are attached to that central carbon? CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2 group? Or wait, maybe it's connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the connectivity. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the ester is formed from propanoic acid and methanol. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (S)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is also known as (S)-lactic acid. When esterified, it becomes methyl ester. So the structure is O

       O
       ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the central carbon has three different groups: two CH3 groups? No, wait. The central carbon is the second carbon, attached to the COOCH3, the hydroxyl group, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2nd carbon is the middle one. So, if the hydroxyl is on the 2nd carbon, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, because that would make the middle carbon have two CH2 groups, which are the same. So in that case, the central carbon would have:

- One CH2COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (leading to another CH2),
- Two more CH2 groups on the same side, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2(CH2COOCH3)OH, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Another approach: when a molecule has a carbon with four different substituents, it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, is the 2nd carbon a chiral center?

The structure is: the ester is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the propanoate. The propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but the middle carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So the middle carbon is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH2. So the groups attached to the middle carbon are two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. But wait, each CH2 is connected to the adjacent carbons. So, the middle carbon is connected to:

- One CH2 group leading to the COOCH3,
- One CH2 group leading to another CH3 (since the chain is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait, the chain is three carbons: COOCH3, CH(OH), CH2, CH3? No, that would be four carbons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps the key point is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the 2nd carbon. Because the hydroxyl, the ester group, and two different adjacent carbons (like a CH3 and another CH2 group) would make that carbon a chiral center. So if that's the case, then this compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

3. The third compound is benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, so the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. Now, is this molecule chiral? Well, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, an oxygen double bond, and a single bond to another group. Wait, no, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is double-bonded to oxygen, and connected to two phenyl groups and the ketone oxygen. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is C=O. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen (double bond). So the groups attached to the carbonyl carbon are: two phenyl groups, an oxygen double bond, and what else? Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is only connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. So that's three substituents. So the carbonyl carbon is trigonal, not tetrahedral, so it doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. The fourth compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So its diester would be dimethyl fumarate: (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait. Fumarate is a trans-dioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration? No, wait, fumarate is (E)-HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So the diester would have two ester groups on the same side as the double bond.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between the two CH2 groups, and each has a COOCH3 group on the same side. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate has the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, let me think again. The structure should be CH2CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, maybe I should think of it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, wait, that's not right. Let me think of fumarate as the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between the two CH2 groups, and each has a COOCH3 substituent on the same side (E configuration). Now, in this case, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side, which could lead to geometric isomerism. But geometric isomerism is about E/Z, not about optical activity.

Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule needs a chiral center. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's see. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. The central carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Because the substituents on the double bond are identical (each is a COOCH3 and a CH3, maybe?), wait no. Wait, each end of the double bond is CH2 on each side. Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C=C-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's more accurate. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two middle CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize it properly.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The correct structure of fumarate is (E)-HOOCCH=CHCOOH. The diester with methanol would replace the HOOC with COOCH3: so CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, but in that case, each of those carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, each of those carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and two H's. Hmm, no. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can approach the question from another angle. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Because if it doesn't, then it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

In the structure I'm imagining, the two carbons in the double bond are each connected to a COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached, but that would require each to have four bonds, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm visualizing this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups, but that's not possible either because each carbon can only have four bonds. So maybe the structure is:

CH2-CH2
   || 
   C=O
   ||
CH2-CH2

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with two methanol molecules, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, each of the two COOH groups becomes COOCH3. So the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH(CH2COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached.

In that structure, each of those carbons would have the following groups: one COOCH3, one CH2 group, and two H's. Wait, no, that can't be because the double bond is between the two CH2 groups, which would each have a COOCH3 substituent. Alternatively, each has a COOCH3 and an H. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately depicted as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C=C-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's not possible because in that case, each end of the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups, which would make each of those carbons have four substituents, which is impossible for a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2(COOCH3)
       ||
       C=O

No, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should remember that dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that would mean each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So each has a COOCH3, a CH2 group, and two H's. So each of those carbons has the groups: COOCH3, two H's, and a CH2 group. That's four groups, which is okay. But in this case, are any of the carbons chiral centers?

Wait, the central carbons in the double bond are each attached to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two H's. So each has three different groups (COOCH3, CH2, H) plus another H, making two H's, which means they're not chiral centers. Because a chiral center must have four different substituents. So if a carbon has two H's, even if the other two are different, it's not a chiral center.

So if each of the double-bonded carbons has two H's, then they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second. I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the double-bonded carbons has one COOCH3, one CH2 group, and two H's. So each has groups: COOCH3, CH2, H, H. So two H's, which means no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any, so no optical isomerism.

But wait, wait, I'm pretty sure that dimethyl fumarate can exhibit optical isomerism. Because I remember that fumarate has a possibility for cis and trans isomers, but in terms of optical activity, does it have a chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with another compound. Let me think: maleic acid and fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the (E) isomer, and maleic acid is the (Z). But neither has a chiral center, so they don't exhibit optical isomerism. They exhibit geometric isomerism instead.

So dimethyl fumarate (the diester of fumaric acid) would also exhibit geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism, because it doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, but wait another thought: could the diester have a chiral center elsewhere? For example, if the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center on an adjacent carbon. Or perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure could be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. So each has:

- COOCH3,
- a CH2 group,
- two H's.

So no, each has two H's, so no chiral centers. So no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should move on and try to evaluate each compound.

So, to recap:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not certain, but I think this might have a chiral axis, leading to optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I think this has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought about compound 4 having cis or trans isomerism, but not optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

But wait, let me think again about compound 1. If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule as a whole is chiral, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. So if the biphenyl structure has substituents arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

In compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para to each other. So, each ring has two substituents in para positions. So, each ring is symmetrical. Now, when looking at the entire molecule, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the overall structure is not symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but if each ring is symmetrical, then the entire molecule might be symmetrical as well. For example, if on each ring, the substituents are arranged in a way that their mirror images are present, then the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus not be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Hmm. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in para positions. Now, when connected, the two rings are in a 1,1' position. So, the substituents on each ring are arranged such that on each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are opposite each other. 

But when connected, the arrangement of substituents across the two rings could lead to a lack of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond, and the carboxylate groups are on the opposite side, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, the overall molecule might be symmetric.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. But I think that biphenyl compounds with substituents in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry would exhibit axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

So, if compound 1 is arranged such that the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, then it would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

Assuming that's the case, then compound 1 would show optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, 1 and 2 have the ability to show optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about compound 4? Earlier I thought it doesn't have any chiral centers, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group. But what about the other substituents? Each has two CH2 groups attached beyond the double bond. Wait, no, because the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and two H's. So, each has two H's, meaning no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, the answer is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4; option D is 1 and 2. Wait, option D is 1 and 2, which I'm concluding are the correct ones.

Wait, but another look: the question is about which compounds show optical isomerism.

So, if 1 and 2 show it, then option D is 1 and 2, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 2 does have a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism, and 1 might as well. So the correct answer would be options 1 and 2.

So, looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → includes 4, which I don't think is correct.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't have it.

D) 1 and 2 → yes.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and to have a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl system with nitro groups at position 6 and carboxylate groups at position 2 on each ring. The substituents on the rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This creates axial chirality, making the molecule optically active.  
   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl (CH3), an ester group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen (H). This chiral center allows the molecule to exist as enantiomers.  
   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This symmetry makes the molecule planar and non-chiral.  
   **Conclusion:** Does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. The double-bonded carbons are each bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH2). This symmetry prevents the molecule from having a chiral center or axial chirality. While it exhibits geometric (E/Z) isomerism, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
   **Conclusion:** Does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)** and **2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
