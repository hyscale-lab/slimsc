Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's read it carefully. The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian provided.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I need to parse this Lagrangian to understand which fermions X can interact with.

Wait, the Lagrangian looks like it's describing the interaction between the boson X and some fermion fields. The term λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f suggests that X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. So, X must interact with fermions f.

But wait, the way the Lagrangian is written, it's actually λ f multiplied by ψ̄_f times (υ + X) times ψ_f. Oh, but υ is probably a constant, like the vacuum expectation value (VEV). So maybe the term is more like λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f, because when X=0, you get the mass term λ f ψ̄_f ψ_f, which would be like (λ f /2) ψ̄_f ψ_f, giving a mass to the fermion. So X is a boson that couples to these fermions, giving them mass when X is at its VEV.

Wait, but for decay purposes, the important thing is which fermions X can couple to. Because in order for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the fermions must be in the loop or perhaps the decay process is X → f f̄. But wait, X is a boson, so it can decay into two fermions if the interaction is allowed.

But looking at the structure, the interaction term is L_int = -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. So the vertex is X ψ_f ψ_f. So X can couple to a pair of fermions ψ_f. So the decay X → ψ_f ψ_f̄ is possible, as long as the energy is sufficient.

But what fermions ψ_f are present in the theory? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we have to assume that f refers to all possible Standard Model fermions, perhaps.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So f is a flavor index, perhaps, but in the interaction term, it's the same f on both ends. So X couples to each fermion species. So for each fermion ψ_f, X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f̄.

But the problem is, what fermions have masses such that 2 m_fermion ≤ m_X. Because for a decay X → f f̄, each fermion must have mass less than or equal to m_X/2.

Given that the mass of X is 6 GeV, so m_X =6 GeV. So each fermion's mass m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, I need to list all fermions in the Standard Model that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~3 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV (way above 3 GeV)
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but for this purpose, their masses are negligible. But in the Standard Model, they are Dirac or Majorana, but their masses would be too small to affect this.

Wait, but wait. The tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2mτ = 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, m_X is 6 GeV, so 2mτ is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs because 2mτ = 3.56 GeV <6 GeV.

Wait, no, wait: 2m_f needs to be ≤ m_X. m_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Tau mass is 1.78 GeV, so that's less than 3 GeV. So tau can be a decay product.

Similarly, looking at the quarks:

Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is exactly half of X's mass. So X can decay into c c̄.

But for bottom quarks: m_b ~4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Similarly, top quark is way too heavy.

What about other leptons?

Electron: 0.5 MeV, so 2m_e <<6 GeV. Okay.

Muon: ~105 MeV, 2m_mu ~0.21 GeV, which is way less than 6 GeV.

So possible fermions for decay:

e-, e+ → allowed.

μ-, μ+ → allowed.

τ-, τ+ → allowed.

For quarks:

u, d, s, c.

But, X can decay into any pair of these quarks, as long as their mass is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but in reality, the quarks can't be produced as free particles because they are confined. But in the context of decay, perhaps the X boson can annihilate or produce quark-antiquark pairs, but only if the energy is sufficient.

So for quarks, let's list their masses:

u: ~1.5 MeV → 2m_u ~3 MeV → allowed.

d: ~3 MeV → 2m_d ~6 MeV → allowed.

s: ~95 MeV → 2m_s ~190 MeV → allowed.

c: ~1.5 GeV → 2m_c ~3 GeV → allowed.

So all these quarks have mass less than 3 GeV, so X can decay into any quark-antiquark pairs: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

But wait, but in the Standard Model, the up, down, strange, and charm quarks have masses below 3 GeV. The bottom is too heavy.

So possible decay channels would be:

X → u ū

X → d d̄

X → s s̄

X → c c̄

X → τ+ τ-

X → μ+ μ-

X → e+ e-

But what about the muon and electron? Since X can interact with any charged lepton as well. So these are possible decay modes.

Wait, but in the options provided, let me look.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But wait, b is too heavy, so A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

That includes c, which is allowed, but no b or t.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, t is way too heavy. 2m_t is 346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So C is wrong.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b which is too heavy.

So the correct option should have c c̄, as in option B, but not include b or t.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is between X and each fermion ψ_f. So ψ_f would include all the fermions (quarks, leptons, etc.) in the model.

But for the decay X → f f̄, the fermion mass is determined by the VEV υ. Wait, wait, the term is (υ + X), so when X is at the VEV, the mass term comes from λ f ψ̄ ψ. So the mass of the fermion would be m_f = λ f υ. Wait, but that's a bit beyond what I need right now.

But regardless, the important thing is which fermions can be produced when X decays.

But perhaps another angle: The decay X → f f̄ is allowed if the fermion f has a mass less than or equal to m_X/2. So for each fermion, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are:

- e, mu, tau (all ≤ 3 GeV)
- u, d, s, c (all ≤3 GeV)
- b is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so no.

So the possible decay products are all the quark-antiquark pairs (u, d, s, c) and all charged lepton pairs (e, mu, tau).

So looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So the possible ones. It's the second option.

Option B is: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options.

Option A includes b, which is too heavy. So incorrect.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy. So incorrect.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy. So incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \), provided the energy is sufficient. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 1.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 3 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 3 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 6 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 190 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (forbidden, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (forbidden, as \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Conclusion:
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \) (quarks with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \) (leptons with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

The decays involving \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are forbidden because their masses exceed \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B**.

Answer: B
