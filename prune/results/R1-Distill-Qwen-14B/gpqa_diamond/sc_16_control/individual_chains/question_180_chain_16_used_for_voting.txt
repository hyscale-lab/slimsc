Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me read it again.

The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.2e-19 C. The particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything else moving them around.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I think point P is where the 13th charge is located. So the setup is that one charge is at the center, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from it.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Wait, in electrostatics, the potential energy is usually calculated when you bring charges from infinity to a certain configuration. But wait, since the system is isolated, maybe the energy is just the potential energy of the configuration as it is.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from the central charge, maybe I can calculate the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve, and then also the potential energy between each pair of the twelve charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem specifies the system is isolated. So I think I need to calculate the total electric potential energy of the system. Electric potential energy for a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them from infinity, considering each pair.

So the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But since each pair contributes, I have to compute this for all possible pairs.

Wait, but let's break it down. There are two types of pairs here: the central charge with each of the twelve others, and the pairs among the twelve.

First, the central charge and each of the 12. Each of these 12 is at 2 meters. So how many such pairs? There are 12. So the energy for these interactions is 12 times (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m. Because each of the twelve is interacting with the central charge.

Then, for the other part, the potential energy between each pair of the twelve charges. How many such pairs are there? For n objects, the number of unique pairs is n(n-1)/2. So for 12, it's 12*11/2 = 66 pairs. Each pair is separated by some distance. Wait, but wait, all the twelve charges are at a fixed distance from P, which is 2 meters. But what is the distance between two of the twelve charges?

Hmm, wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. I'm assuming that all twelve are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters centered at P. So each of them is 2 meters away from P, but their mutual distances vary depending on their positions on the sphere.

Wait, but if they're all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distance between any two charges depends on the angle between them. But calculating the potential energy for each pair would be complicated because each pair has a different distance. But wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the twelve charges are equally spaced on the sphere, so that each pair is at the same distance. No, that's not possible unless they are arranged in a regular polyhedron, but with twelve points, I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and assuming that all the twelve charges are so close that their mutual distances can be approximated as zero, but that doesn't make sense because their distance from P is 2 m. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the others, but not the potential energy among the twelve. Because if the twelve are fixed, perhaps their potential energy is considered as fixed and part of the system's configuration. But wait, the problem states that the system's minimum energy. So maybe the minimum energy occurs when the twelve charges are placed as far apart as possible, which would minimize the repulsion and thus the potential energy. Or perhaps the opposite—wait, in electric potential energy, when like charges are close, the potential energy is higher (since repulsion), so to minimize the energy, you'd have them as far apart as possible. But wait, the problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps their mutual distances can't be controlled, so we have to consider all possible pairs of those twelve, each at some distance from each other.

Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy between the twelve can be ignored or is zero. Hmm, but that can't be right because the twelve are all positive charges and would repel each other, contributing to the total potential energy. So perhaps I have to compute both the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve, and the potential energy between each pair of the twelve.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distances between the twelve, how can we compute their mutual potential energy? That's a problem. Unless, perhaps, the problem is implying that the twelve are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters, but that's not possible unless they are all at the same point, which would make their mutual distance zero. But that would make the potential energy infinitely large, which can't be right.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not the potential energy among the twelve. Because perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible or the problem is simplified that way. Or perhaps the twelve are fixed in place relative to each other, so their mutual potential energy is a constant, but the problem is only asking about the energy due to their interaction with the central charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve. Let me think.

Wait, the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps we need to arrange the charges in a way that the potential energy is minimized. Since all the twelve are at 2 m from P, their mutual distances can vary. To minimize the total potential energy, you would arrange them as far apart as possible. The most spread-out configuration would minimize the repulsive potential energy. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. So maybe the problem is not considering the mutual potential energy between the twelve charges, and only the energy between each and the central charge is considered. Because if that were the case, then the mutual potential energy would be a positive term, which would increase the total energy. But if the problem is looking for the minimum energy, perhaps it's considering only the central charge's contribution and ignoring the mutual repulsion, which seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the twelve charges are so far apart that their mutual distances are effectively much larger than 2 meters, so their mutual potential energy is negligible. But that's an assumption, and the problem doesn't state that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy among the twelve charges, perhaps because the 13th charge is the main contributor. But I'm not sure. Let's proceed with what's given.

So, to compute the potential energy of the system, we'll consider all pairs. So the total U is the sum of U between the central charge and each of the twelve, plus the sum of U between each pair of the twelve.

So first, the central charge (q13) is at P, and each of the twelve charges (q1 to q12) is at 2m from P. So the potential energy for each pair (q13 and qi) is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total for these is 12 * U_i.

Now, for the pairs among the twelve, each pair (q_i, q_j) where i < j, the distance between them could vary. But without knowing their exact positions, perhaps the problem is assuming that all these pairs are at the same distance. But that's only possible if they are arranged in a regular fashion on the sphere, but even then, the distance would depend on the angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the twelve charges are so close that their mutual distances can be approximated as zero, but that would make the potential energy between them infinite, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not their mutual interactions, which would make the calculation manageable.

Looking back at the problem statement: it says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the mutual distances between the twelve are not specified. So perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is unlikely because they are all positive and repel. Or perhaps the twelve are fixed and their positions are set in a way that their mutual potential energy is considered zero. Hmm, but that doesn't make physical sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the twelve charges, focusing only on their interaction with the central charge. Because, perhaps, the problem is designed that way, simplifying the scenario.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed under both assumptions and see which one fits with the options given.

Option 1: Calculate only the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve.

Each of these pairs has charge 2e each, so each U is k * (2e)(2e)/(2m).

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C, so 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So per pair:

U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (3.2e-19 C)^2 / (2 m)

Wait, let's compute that.

(3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = let's compute 8.988 * 10.24 ≈ let's see, 8 *10=80, 8*0.24≈1.92, 0.988 *10=9.88, 0.988 *0.24≈0.237. Adding up: 80+1.92=81.92; 9.88 +0.237≈10.117. Total approx 81.92 + 10.117 = 92.037. So 92.037e-29.

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24) * 1e9 *1e-38 = (approx 92.03) *1e-29.

So 92.03e-29 J.

Wait, but wait, that's for a single pair. But then we have 12 such pairs.

So total U = 12 * (8.988e9 * (2e)^2 ) / (2m )

Which is 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4e²) ) / (2*2) ] ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each term step by step.

Wait, let's compute each U:

U = k * (2e) * (2e) / r

r is 2 meters.

So U = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2)

Simplify 4e²: 4*(1.6e-19)^2 = 4*2.56e-38 = 10.24e-38 C².

So U = (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / 2.

So 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 8.988 *10.24= approximately 92.03, as before. So 92.03e-29, divided by 2 is 46.015e-29 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 46.015e-29 *12 = 552.18e-29 J.

Wait, 552.18e-29 is 5.5218e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's only considering the central charge and the twelve. What about the mutual potential energies between the twelve charges?

If we include those, the total energy would be higher. Because each pair of the twelve contributes a positive amount to the potential energy. So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of all these.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact distance between each pair, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the central charge, which would give us about 5.5e-27 J, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than that. Option B is 2.8e-26, which is larger. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute U for each central charge pair:

q = 2e = 2*(1.6e-19 C) = 3.2e-19 C.

r = 2 m.

So U = k * q1 * q2 / r.

So U = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19) * (3.2e-19) / 2.

Compute numerator: 3.2e-19 *3.2e-19 =10.24e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24) * 1e9 *1e-38.

8.988 *10.24 = let's compute:

8 *10 =80.

8 *0.24=1.92.

0.988 *10=9.88.

0.988 *0.24≈0.237.

Adding: 80 +1.92=81.92; 9.88 +0.237=10.117.

Total 81.92 +10.117=92.037.

So 92.037e-29 J, but then we divide by 2 for r=2m.

So 92.037e-29 / 2 = 46.0185e-29 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 46.0185e-29 *12 = 552.222e-29 J.

Which is 5.52222e-27 J.

But wait, that's without considering the mutual potential energies between the twelve charges. If we include those, the total would be higher.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, but the options don't include 5.5e-27. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5.645 x10^-26

B) 2.822 x10^-26

C)7.056 x10^-27

D)122.330

Wait, 5.5e-27 is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but it's not exact. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 3.2e-19 C is correct.

Compute U between central and each of twelve:

U = k*(2e)^2 / (2m) per pair.

Wait, perhaps I should factor that in.

Wait, let me recompute:

(2e) = 3.2e-19 C.

So U for one pair is (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (3.2e-19 C)^2 / (2 m).

Compute numerator: (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24) * 1e9 *1e-38.

As before, 8.988 *10.24 ≈ 92.03.

So 92.03e-29 J.

But since r is 2m, divide by 2: 92.03e-29 / 2 = 46.015e-29 J.

Multiply by 12: 46.015e-29 *12 = 552.18e-29 J = 5.5218e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option C:7.056e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Did I forget that each pair is counted twice? No, because I'm considering each pair once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy also includes the work done to bring the charges from infinity to their positions, which would include both the central charge and the twelve. Wait, but the central charge is fixed at P, so I don't have to bring it. Only the twelve are brought into place.

Wait, but the twelve are identical and each is brought from infinity to their position at 2m from P. So the potential energy for each would be the work done by an external agent to bring it there, considering the existing charges already present.

Wait, that's more accurate. Because when building up the system, each charge is brought in from infinity, and the work done is against the electric field of the existing charges.

So for the first charge, when you bring it to 2m from P, there's no other charges present yet, so the work done is zero. Then, bringing the second charge, you have to consider the electric field from the first charge. But wait, the first charge is fixed at P, and the second charge is being placed at a point 2m from P. So the electric field at that point is only due to the central charge. Because the other charges are not placed yet.

Wait, the twelve charges are all being placed at 2m from P, but each is placed one by one. So when placing the nth charge, the electric field at its position is due to the (n-1) charges already in place, plus the central charge.

Wait, but the central charge is fixed, so its field is the same for each charge being placed. So the potential energy calculation for each charge being placed involves the central charge and all previously placed charges.

But that complicates things, as each charge's placement affects the next.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to use the formula for the potential energy of a configuration of point charges, which is (1/2) * sum over all pairs of (k q_i q_j / r_ij).

Because each pair is counted once, the total energy U is (1/2) * sum of all pairs. Wait, why 1/2? Because each pair is considered twice in the sum (i,j and j,i), so to avoid double-counting, we multiply by 1/2.

Ah, that's right. So the formula for the total potential energy is U = (1/2) * sum over all i < j of (k q_i q_j / r_ij).

So in our case, the twelve charges are each 2e, and the central charge is 2e.

So the total U is:

U = (1/2) [ (central charge interaction with each of twelve) + (sum of interactions between each pair of the twelve) ]

So let's compute each part.

First, the central charge interacts with each of the twelve. Each r is 2m.

So the sum for these pairs is 12 * (k * (2e)(2e) / 2m).

Each term is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2*2) ?

Wait no, wait:

Wait, each of the twelve charges is 2e. The central charge is 2e.

So each pair (central and one of twelve) contributes:

k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

So per pair, that's (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9 *10.24e-38) = 92.03e-29, then divided by 2 gives 46.015e-29 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 46.015e-29 *12 = 552.18e-29 J.

But since in the U formula, all pairs are considered, including central and the twelve. So the sum for central charge and twelve is 12 * (46.015e-29) = 552.18e-29 J.

Now, the sum of interactions among the twelve charges.

Each pair among the twelve contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j in the twelve.

But without knowing the exact positions, we can't compute the exact distances. However, perhaps the problem is assuming that the twelve are placed in such a way that their mutual distances are 2m as well. But that's not possible unless all are at the same point, which would make r_ij zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which is not practical.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the twelve are placed at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or some other regular polyhedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2m, so that the average distance between any two charges is a certain value. But without knowing the exact arrangement, this is impossible to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the mutual potential energy is negligible, but that's unlikely. Because each pair contributes a positive amount, so the total potential energy would be higher than just the central charge's contribution.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5.1 times larger than the 5.5e-27 J we calculated for the central charge interactions.

Hmm, that's a clue. So perhaps we're missing a factor of 5 or so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the interactions, including both the central charge and the mutual interactions among the twelve. But without knowing the mutual distances, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve, and the mutual interactions are zero. But that's not possible because the mutual charges are positive and will repel.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a miscalculation, and I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is treating the twelve charges as a single entity, and calculating the potential energy between the central charge and the group. But that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a point charge in an electric field created by other charges.

Wait, the central charge is fixed. So the potential energy of each of the twelve charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the electric field from the central charge and from the other eleven charges.

But when calculating the total potential energy, each charge's placement affects the others.

Alternatively, the formula for the total potential energy U of a system of charges is U = (1/2) * sum over all pairs of (k q_i q_j / r_ij).

So for our system, we have 13 charges in total: 1 at the center (q13) and twelve around (q1 to q12).

So the total U is:

U = (1/2) [ (sum over i=1 to 12) (k q13 qi / r1i ) ) + (sum over i < j, i,j=1 to 12) (k qi qj / rij) ) ]

Where r1i is 2m for each i, and rij is the distance between qi and qj.

But since the rij distances are unknown, perhaps the problem is only considering the first term, the interactions between the central charge and the twelve. But that would give U = (1/2) * 12 * (k*(2e)^2 / 2m).

Wait, because each pair (central and one charge) is counted once in the sum. So U would be (1/2) * (12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)) ).

Wait, let's compute that.

(1/2) * 12 =6.

So, 6 * [ (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 ) / (2*2 m) ]

Wait, wait, let's compute each step.

Each term for central and a charge is (k*(2e)(2e))/(2m) = (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2/(2*2).

Wait, 3.2e-19 squared is 10.24e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 92.03e-29.

Divide by 4 (because 2m in the denominator) → 92.03e-29 /4 = 23.0075e-29.

Multiply by 6 (from 1/2 *12) → 23.0075e-29 *6 ≈ 138.045e-29 J → 1.38045e-27 J.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included both the central interactions and the mutual interactions of the twelve.

But without knowing rij, I can't compute the mutual terms. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions, which would give us 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger than the 5.5e-27 J I calculated earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of terms.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each pair of charges, including both the central and the twelve, and the mutual interactions. So let's re-express the U calculation.

Total U is the sum for each pair (including central charge) and each pair among the twelve.

Wait, but without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the mutual distances are 2m as well. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what's intended.

Wait, if the twelve charges are placed on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, and each is 2m away from P, then the distance between any two charges on the sphere would be determined by the angle they make at the center. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is simplifying and taking the distance between any two charges as 2m. So rij = 2m for all i != j.

Wait, that's a possible approach, but it's not realistic because on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum distance between two points is 4m (diametrically opposite), and the minimum is 0. However, perhaps the problem is assuming rij = 2m for all i and j, which is an approximation.

If that's the case, then the mutual potential energy between each pair of the twelve would be U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = same as the central charge interactions.

So for the mutual interactions among the twelve, the number of pairs is C(12,2) =66.

Each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) → same as each central pair.

So each mutual pair contributes 46.015e-29 J (as calculated earlier for central pairs).

So 66 pairs would contribute 66 *46.015e-29 = 3036.9e-29 J → 3.0369e-26 J.

Now, the central charge contributes 12 pairs, each contributing 46.015e-29 J → 552.18e-29 =5.5218e-27 J.

So total U would be 3.0369e-26 +5.5218e-27 = approximately 3.589e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the assumption that rij=2m is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the twelve charges is being neglected, which would leave U as 5.5218e-27 J, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as zero. But why would that be the case? Unless the twelve charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible with all positive charges.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are arranged in a way that their potential energies cancel out. But that's not possible with like charges.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy due to the central charge and the twelve, and the mutual potentials are considered as part of the system's configuration and not contributing to the energy change.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum energy occurs when all the twelve are as far apart as possible, thus minimizing their mutual potential energy. But without knowing their arrangement, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not their mutual interactions. Let me calculate that again.

Each central pair: 46.015e-29 J.

Twelve such pairs: 552.18e-29 J →5.5218e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger than this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the sum without the 1/2 factor, meaning I should multiply by 2. Let me see:

If U = sum over all pairs, without dividing by 2, then for the central charge, 12 pairs, each 46.015e-29 →552.18e-29 J.

For the mutual pairs, 66 pairs, each 46.015e-29 →3036.9e-29 J.

Total U = 552.18e-29 +3036.9e-29 = 3589.08e-29 = 3.58908e-26 J.

Which is 3.59e-26 J. But option B is 2.822e-26, which is lower than that.

Hmm, perhaps there's a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the central charge is 2e and each of the twelve is 2e. So each central pair's potential is k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (8.988e9)(4e²)/(2*2m).

Wait, let me recompute this.

(2e) =3.2e-19 C.

So for each central pair:

U = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2*2)

= (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) /4.

So 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =92.03e-29.

Divide by 4 →23.0075e-29 J.

Multiply by 12 →23.0075e-29 *12=276.09e-29 =2.7609e-27 J.

Now, for the mutual pairs: 66 pairs.

Each mutual pair's U is (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2 / rij.

Assuming rij=2m, same as before.

So U per mutual pair: 92.03e-29 /4 =23.0075e-29 J.

Multiply by 66: 66*23.0075e-29=1518.495e-29=1.518495e-26 J.

Total U:2.7609e-27 +1.518495e-26 = (0.27609 +1.518495)e-26 =1.79458e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions, which is 2.76e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each, so the product is 4e², but perhaps I'm miscalculating the exponents.

Wait, let's compute (3.2e-19)^2:

(3.2e-19)^2 = (3.2)^2 * (1e-19)^2 =10.24e-38 C².

So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the twelve charges are all brought into place by the central charge, but their mutual interactions are not considered because the problem states that the system is isolated. Wait, but the mutual interactions are part of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as U = (k q^2)/(r) * (n), but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the twelve and the central charge, but not their mutual potentials. So the total U would be 12 * (k (2e)^2 )/(2m).

Which is 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2) / (2*2).

Wait, let's compute that again.

(3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =92.03e-29.

Divide by (2*2)=4: 92.03e-29 /4 =23.0075e-29.

Multiply by 12:23.0075e-29 *12 =276.09e-29 =2.7609e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger than 2.76e-27.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in considering the number of pairs, but I can't find where.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each charge is interacting with the central charge and with the other eleven, so 12 interactions for each charge, but that would lead to double-counting.

Wait, the central charge is fixed. So each of the twelve charges interacts with the central charge once, and with each other charge once. So each charge has 12 interactions (central + 11 others). But that's not correct; the central charge is one, and each of the twelve has 11 other charges to interact with. So the mutual interactions are C(12,2)=66 pairs.

Perhaps the problem is including both the central interactions and the mutual interactions, but using rij=2m for all mutual pairs. So the total U is 12*(k (2e)^2/(2m)) + 66*(k (2e)^2/(2m)).

Which would be (12 +66) * [8.988e9*(3.2e-19)^2/(2*2)].

12+66=78.

78 * [8.988e9 *10.24e-38 /4 ].

So 78 *23.0075e-29 =78 *23.0075e-29 = 1800.57e-29 =1.80057e-26 J.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is approximately 1.8e-26 *1.57.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k q^2)/(r) * n, where n is the number of charges.

n=12, q=2e, r=2m.

So U =12 * [ (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 ] / (2*2).

Which is same as before: 12 * [ 92.03e-29 ] /4 →12 *23.0075e-29 =2.7609e-27 J.

But that again doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e instead of 2e? No, because the charge is 2e.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the U for one pair.

U = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2*2).

Compute denominator: 2*2=4.

Numerator:8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 =8.988e9 *10.24e-38=92.03e-29.

Divide by 4: 92.03e-29 /4 =23.0075e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.0075e-29 *12=276.09e-29=2.7609e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the twelve charges not only interacts with the central charge but also with the other eleven, and each of these interactions contributes the same amount.

So the total U would be:

(12 * (central interactions)) + (66 * (mutual interactions)).

Assuming mutual interactions each contribute the same as the central interactions, which would be 23.0075e-29 J.

So:

12 *23.0075e-29=276.09e-29.

66*23.0075e-29=1518.495e-29.

Total U=276.09e-29 +1518.495e-29=1794.585e-29=1.794585e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the mutual interactions and not the central charge. But that's unlikely because the central charge is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not the mutual interactions. So the answer would be 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k. Maybe it's using 8.988e9 N·m²/C², which I have used.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute without the 1/2 factor.

Wait, in the formula U = sum over all i < j of (k q_i q_j / r_ij ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (k q^2 )/(r) multiplied by the number of charges minus one. So for the central charge, each charge is brought in, and the work done is against the central charge's field plus the previously placed charges.

Wait, let's think about building the system step by step.

1. Place the central charge at P: no work needed, as there are no other charges.

2. Bring the first charge from infinity to 2m from P. The only field is from the central charge. So work done is U1 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2/(2*2) = as before, 23.0075e-29 J.

3. Bring the second charge. Now, the field at the new position is due to the central charge and the first charge. So the work done is U2 = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) + k*(2e)*(2e)/(r_12).

But without knowing r_12, we can't compute it. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible without more information.

Given all this confusion, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve, and not the mutual interactions. Let me check the options again.

The only option close to 5.5e-27 J is option C,7.056e-27. But wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2*2) accurately.

3.2^2=10.24.

(3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38.

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24 )e-29.

8.988 *10.24:

Calculate 8 *10=80.

8 *0.24=1.92.

0.988 *10=9.88.

0.988 *0.24=0.23712.

Adding all: 80+1.92=81.92; 9.88+0.23712=10.11712.

Total=81.92 +10.11712=92.03712.

So 92.03712e-29.

Divide by (2*2)=4: 92.03712e-29 /4=23.00928e-29.

Multiply by 12:23.00928e-29 *12=276.11136e-29=2.7611136e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes twice this value, perhaps because each charge is counted twice.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because each pair is only counted once in the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is calculating the work done by bringing each charge, considering the field from all other charges, including the mutual interactions.

But without knowing the mutual distances, this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a mistake in the number of pairs. For example, perhaps the number of central pairs is 12, and the number of mutual pairs is 66, but the problem is only considering 12 pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the twelve charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) and the central charge contributes the same, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k q^2)/(r) * n, where n is 12, q=2e, r=2m. So:

U = 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 ] / (2m).

Wait, but earlier calculation for 12 central pairs gives 2.76e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the potential energy as the product of the number of charges, their charge squared, and other constants.

But without knowing the exact approach, I'm stuck. Looking at the options, the only one that seems plausible based on our calculation is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is approximately ten times larger than our calculated value. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating 3.2e-19 squared.

Wait, (3.2e-19)^2 is indeed 10.24e-38 C².

So 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =92.037e-29 J·m/C² * C² → yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the 1/2 factor in the potential energy formula. So for each pair, including both (i,j) and (j,i), we count each twice. So the total U would be 2 * (sum of all pairs) / 2. Wait, that would just give the sum of all pairs once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without the 1/2 factor, so U = sum over all pairs (without considering i < j).

In that case, the number of pairs for the central charge is 12, and for the mutual pairs it's 12*11=132. So total U =12*U_central +132*U_mutual.

Assuming U_mutual is same as U_central per pair.

So 12*23.0075e-29 +132*23.0075e-29 = (12+132)*23.0075e-29=144*23.0075e-29=3313.08e-29=3.31308e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes (k q^2)/(r), so for 12 charges, it's 12*(k (2e)^2)/(2m).

Which is same as before: 12*(8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 )/(2*2).

Which is 2.76e-27 J.

But none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me recalculate with k=9e9.

So U_central per pair =9e9 * (3.2e-19)^2/(2*2).

=9e9 *10.24e-38 /4.

= (9e9 *10.24e-38 )=92.16e-29.

Divide by 4:23.04e-29 per pair.

12 pairs:276.48e-29=2.7648e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e instead of 2e for the charges. Let me see.

If each charge is e, then q=1.6e-19 C.

So U_central per pair =8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2/(2*2).

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38=23.007e-29.

Divide by 4:5.75175e-29.

12 pairs:5.75175e-29 *12=69.021e-29=6.9021e-28 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula, such as U = (k q^2 )/(r) without considering the number of charges.

But I don't see how that would fit.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the mutual potential energy to be zero, which would give us 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only a single pair, giving 23.0075e-29 J, but that's not an option either.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is approximately ten times larger than what I calculated. But I can't see where the factor of ten comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the units.

Each charge is 2e, so 3.2e-19 C.

r =2m.

So U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (3.2e-19 C)^2 / (2 m).

So units: N·m²/C² * C² → N·m². Divided by m → N·m, which is J. Correct.

So the calculation is correct.

But perhaps the problem is using 2e in a different way, like each charge is 2e but the central charge is e. No, the problem states all are 2e.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the twelve charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e, but the mutual interactions are each 2e *2e / rij, but without knowing rij, it's impossible.

In conclusion, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times 2.82e-27 J. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include only the central charge interactions, giving 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is C, 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation by not considering that each pair is counted once, and the mutual interactions are to be included. Let me compute the potential energy again with mutual interactions, assuming rij=2m.

So U = (1/2) [ 12*(k (2e)^2/(2m)) + 66*(k (2e)^2/(2m)) ]

= (1/2) [ (12 +66) * (k (2e)^2/(2m)) ]

= (1/2) *78 * (92.03e-29/4 )

= (78/2) * (23.0075e-29 )

=39 *23.0075e-29 = 897.3e-29 =8.973e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are considered to be zero, which would give U= (1/2)*12*(23.0075e-29 )= 138.045e-29=1.38045e-27 J, which is option none.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The option that seems closest to our initial calculation (without mutual interactions) is option C,7.056e-27 J, but it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times larger than our initial calculation. But I'm not sure why.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total charge as 13 * 2e, but that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k q^2 )/(r) * n, where n=13, but that would include the central charge as well, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the twelve charges contributes a potential energy of (k (2e)^2)/(2m), and the central charge contributes (k (2e)^2)/(2m) for each of the twelve.

So the total U would be 13 * (k (2e)^2/(2m)).

But that would be 13 *23.0075e-29=300.0975e-29=3.000975e-27 J. Closer to option C, but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the central charge interacts with each of the twelve, and each of the twelve interacts with the central charge, so 12*2=24 pairs. But that's not correct because each pair is counted once.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer option B, 2.822e-26, which is 10 times larger than our initial calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait: 3.2e-19 C squared is 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9 →8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =92.03e-29.

Divide by 4 (2m) →23.0075e-29.

Multiply by 12 →276.09e-29=2.7609e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to multiply by 10, leading to 2.76e-26, which is close to option B's 2.822e-26.

But why would that be the case? Perhaps a miscalculation in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation leads to option B. But I'm not seeing how.

After much deliberation, I think the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J. But I'm not fully confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained at a distance of 2 meters from a central charge fixed at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is determined by considering the interactions between the central charge and the twelve charges, as well as the mutual interactions among the twelve charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Central Charge Interactions**:  
   Each of the twelve charges interacts with the central charge. The potential energy for one such pair is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = k \frac{(2e)^2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting \( 2e = 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), the energy for one pair is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(3.2 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2 \times 2} = 23.0075 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for these interactions is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central, total}} = 12 \times 23.0075 \times 10^{-29} = 2.7609 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Mutual Interactions Among the Twelve Charges**:  
   The twelve charges are assumed to be equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 meters. The distance between any two charges is approximated as \( 2 \, \text{m} \). The number of unique pairs among the twelve charges is \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \). The potential energy for one such pair is the same as for the central charge interactions:  
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(3.2 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2 \times 2} = 23.0075 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The total energy for these mutual interactions is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual, total}} = 66 \times 23.0075 \times 10^{-29} = 1.5185 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Total Potential Energy**:  
   The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the central charge interactions and the mutual interactions:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central, total}} + U_{\text{mutual, total}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 2.7609 \times 10^{-27} + 1.5185 \times 10^{-26} = 1.7946 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated total potential energy \( 1.7946 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly larger than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, as it is the closest to the calculated value.  

ANSWER: B
