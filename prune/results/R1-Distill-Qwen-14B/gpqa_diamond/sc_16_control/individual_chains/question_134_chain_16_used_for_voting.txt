Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of enthalpy calculations. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and molarities are given for each. The options are four, with different values, some in kcal and others in kJ. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The neutralization reaction is usually exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative, which matches all the options given.

Wait, but how do I approach mixing three solutions? I think I should figure out the moles of each acid and base first because the neutralization depends on the acid and base reacting with each other.

Breaking it down:

The solutions involved are hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)2]. HCl and H2SO4 are acids. Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the reaction would involve the acids reacting with the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. HCl is a strong acid. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but since it's diprotic, each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So I need to consider how much each acid contributes to the total H+ ions and how much the base contributes to OH- ions.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the overall neutralization reaction. The general reaction would be acid + base → salt + water. The enthalpy of neutralization is often considered per mole of H+ or OH- reacted, depending on the context.

But wait, in neutralization, each H+ from the acid reacts with an OH- from the base. So, I need to find the limiting reactant between the total H+ available from the acids and the OH- available from the base.

Let me calculate the moles of each component.

HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, giving 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Since Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions, each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the total H+ from the acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

The OH- available from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

So, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. But which is the limiting reagent here?

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant. Because 0.2 moles of OH- can only react with 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait a second. The H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it might have two H+ ions. So in the neutralization, each OH- neutralizes one H+. So the total H+ available is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, and some H+ remains.

So the total moles of water formed from neutralization is 0.2 moles. Because each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of H+.

But wait, that's just the neutralization part. The excess H+ would contribute to the solution's acidity, but for the enthalpy calculation, I think we only consider the neutralization part.

But wait, another point: the enthalpy of neutralization is typically given per mole of H+ or OH- neutralized. So for strong acids and bases, it's about 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) because the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (but sometimes it's given as -56 or -57, depending on the source).

Wait, but in the options, some are in kcal, others in kJ. So I need to make sure about the units. Let me think: 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if the answer is in kcal, I might need to convert from kJ.

But first, let's calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH- total: 0.2.

So, the neutralization reaction will involve 0.2 moles of both H+ and OH-.

Wait, but what about the excess H+? Since the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed, I think only the neutralization part is considered, not any other reactions.

Additionally, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. Similarly, HCl is strong. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will dissociate completely.

So the mixing of these will lead to neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+ with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So from 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, we have 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+. H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+ (since it's diprotic, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18).

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 of H+.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, which means the enthalpy change would be based on that.

Assuming each mole of H+ neutralization releases about 57 kJ (since the standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol), then 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem might consider the enthalpy per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-.

Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy is per mole of acid or base, but generally, it's per mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles of H+ neutralization would give 0.2 * (-57,000 J/mol) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options include a -11.42 kcal. Hmm. Let me calculate 11,400 J in kcal.

Since 1 kcal = 4184 J, 11,400 J / 4184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, hold on. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's think again.

Wait, the neutralization of 1 mole of H+ releases approximately 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would release 11.4 kJ, which is approximately 11.4 kJ. But one of the options is D) -16.0 kJ, and another is B) -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the total reaction. Because when mixing HCl and H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2, perhaps the reaction is more complex than just H+ + OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the formation of specific salts, like BaCl2 and BaSO4, but I don't think so because the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, not the formation of salts.

Wait, maybe I should consider the stoichiometry more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of acid or base. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me try a different approach. The neutralization reaction when an acid and base are mixed is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is approximately -57 kJ per mole.

But in this case, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ and option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). But none of the options match that directly.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- is 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me check what -11.4 kJ is in kcal.

11,400 J → 11.4 kJ.

11.4 kJ = 11400 J.

1 kcal is 4184 J. So 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. So that would be approximately -2.726 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's close.

Wait, but why? Because the neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+ would release 0.2 *57 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 is around 2.726). So that would be option A.

Wait, but why is there option D as -16 kJ? Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Let me recheck the calculations.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 *0.2 =0.1 mol. H+ is 0.1.

H2SO4: 300 mL =0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3=0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2.

H+ total: 0.28, OH-:0.2.

So 0.2 mol neutralization.

So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I miscalculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry differently.

Wait, another approach: maybe the neutralization isn't just H+ and OH-.

Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, which is a strong acid, the reaction could be more complex.

Wait, maybe I should write the net ionic equations.

HCl is a strong acid → H+ + Cl-.

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

The neutralization between acids and base would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

But perhaps the total reaction is considering all the H+ and OH-.

But then, why the options are different? Option D is -16 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each reaction separately.

Let me think: how much of each acid reacts with the base.

So, the H+ available is 0.28, the OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant.

So, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH-.

But perhaps I should compute how much H+ comes from each acid.

HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 contributes 0.18 mol H+.

So, the OH- (0.2 mol) will first react with the H+ from HCl, and then with the H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, but since both HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids, their H+ will be in solution together. So the OH- will react with the H+ in solution, regardless of which acid it comes from.

So the first 0.1 mol of OH- will neutralize the HCl's H+, and the remaining 0.1 mol of OH- will neutralize the H2SO4's H+.

So, the 0.1 from HCl all reacts, and 0.1 from H2SO4 reacts, leaving 0.08 mol of H+ from H2SO4 unreacted.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2. So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, why is option D) -16.0 kJ? That's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be considering the heat of neutralization per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of this reaction releases about 57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles would release 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but another thought: what if the problem is considering the reaction as the neutralization of each acid with the base, not just the H+?

Hmm, that might complicate things. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, when it neutralizes with a base, each H+ reacts with OH-.

But wait, the overall result would still be 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moles of H+ and OH- separately, and see which is less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but it's a dihydroxide. So each mole gives two OH-.

The total H+ is 0.28, the OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent, leading to 0.2 moles of H2O.

So, the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57,000) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have -11.4 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- again, perhaps I made a mistake.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So the OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

So, 0.2 * 57 kJ → 11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → about -11.4 kJ.

Because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. Wait, 2.72 kcal is 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.40 kJ.

Wait, so option A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

So that matches.

Wait, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Let me calculate precisely.

11.4 kJ is exactly 11400 J.

1 kcal is 4184 J.

So 11400 /4184 = 2.726 kcal.

So approximately -2.73 kcal. Closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's about 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.6 kJ. Which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the neutralization of H2SO4 is more exothermic? No, the standard enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the moles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ from both acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then find which is the limiting reagent.

In this case, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, leading to 0.2 *57, which is 11.4 kJ or about 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

So looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches.

Alternatively, why is option D there? Maybe if someone calculates per mole of acid or base, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Ba(OH)2 reacting with H2SO4 in a 1:1 ratio, but that may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of both H+ ions from H2SO4 and HCl, but only some of them react.

Because the OH- is 0.2, which is less than the total H+ (0.28). So 0.2 moles of H+ react.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to give 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is limiting, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacts with \( \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \).  
     For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{1}{4.184} \, \text{kcal} \),  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{-11.4}{4.184} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

5. **Match the result with the options:**  
   The calculated enthalpy change of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to option A. Other options either have incorrect unit conversions or values.

**Answer: A**
