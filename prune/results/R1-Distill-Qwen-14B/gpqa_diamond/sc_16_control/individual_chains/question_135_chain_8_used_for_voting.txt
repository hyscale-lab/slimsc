Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, not sure I got that right. Oh wait, maybe it's a Yukawa interaction term. Because Yukawa couplings involve fermion fields and a boson field, like for the Higgs. So the structure looks similar to the Yukawa Lagrangian where the Higgs field (or here, X) interacts with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find what particles X can decay into, kinematically allowed.

Kinematic decay means the energy and mass requirements. For a boson to decay into two particles, their combined mass should be less than the mass of the boson. Also, considering conservation laws like charge, but I think the problem is more about mass and available particles.

Wait, I remember that for a boson decay, the decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the boson. So each possible pair (like fermion and anti-fermion) must have a mass that's less than X's mass.

But wait, the fermion mass is involved. The fermions in the Lagrangian are ψf(y), which are presumably Dirac fermions. So the X field can decay into a pair of fermions if their rest mass is less than or equal to X's mass.

So the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. But which fermions are involved?

Looking at the Lagrangian again: the term is -λ f f-bar ψf (v + X) ψf. Hmm, maybe ψf is a fermion field. So the interaction is between X and ψf particles.

Wait, perhaps ψf is a fermion that X can couple to. So the decay products would be ψf and anti-ψf. So X can decay into ψf ψf-bar? Or wait, no, because that would require each ψf to have a certain mass.

Wait, the general rule is that for a boson of mass M, it can decay into a pair of particles each of mass m, as long as 2m ≤ M. Because each particle would have rest mass m, so together 2m must be less than or equal to M.

So X has mass 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV.

But wait, what's the mass of each fermion in the Standard Model? Let's think about the known fermion masses.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses (approximate):

u: ~2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
d: ~4-5 MeV
s: ~95-105 MeV
c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
b: ~4.5-5 GeV
t: ~173 GeV (way above 3 GeV)
Similarly, leptons: e, mu, tau, etc.

e: ~0.511 MeV
mu: ~105.7 MeV
tau: ~1.78 GeV

So for fermions with m ≤ 3 GeV, let's see which ones qualify.

So quarks:

u: 2 MeV → yes
d: 5 MeV → yes
s: 100 MeV → yes
c: 1.5 GeV → yes (because 1.5 <3)
b: 4.5 GeV → no, 4.5>3.
t: way above.

Leptons:

e: 0.5 MeV → yes
mu: 105 MeV → yes
tau: 1.78 GeV → yes (1.78 <3)
Other leptons like the neutrinos are massless (or nearly so), so they can be produced as well.

So the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar (because c is about 1.5 GeV, so 2c is 3 GeV, which is allowed), e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait wait, wait. Let me calculate 2m for each fermion:

u: 2*2 =4 MeV → way under 6 GeV → allowed.
d: 2*5=10 MeV → allowed.
s: 2*100=200 MeV → allowed.
c: 2*1.5=3 GeV → exactly 3 GeV, which is allowed because 6 GeV is the mass of X, so 3 is less than 6.
e: 2*0.511 ≈1 MeV → allowed.
mu: 2*105.7=211 MeV → allowed.
tau: 2*1.78=3.56 GeV → wait, 3.56 GeV is larger than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV). Wait wait no, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. Wait, 3.56 GeV is the sum of two tau masses. Because 2m = 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. So 3.56 <6, so allowed.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait X has mass 6 GeV. So each decay product must have a rest mass less than 3 GeV. Because 2m <=6 → m<=3.

So for tau, m is 1.78 GeV which is less than 3 GeV. So yes, tau pairs are allowed.

So possible decay products are:

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar,

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-.

Wait, but what about other possibilities? Are there any other fermions? Neutrinos have negligible mass, so X could decay into nu and anti-nu. But in the options, I don't see neutrinos as possible decay products. So maybe the Lagrangian only includes charged fermions?

Looking back at the Lagrangian, it's written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψf (v +X) ψf. The term f f-bar suggests that ψf is a Dirac fermion, possibly charged.

So perhaps the interaction is with charged fermions. So the decay products would be charged particles. But neutrinos are neutral, so maybe the interaction doesn't include them. So in the given Lagrangian, which fermions are involved?

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. The term is -λ f f-bar ψf (v + X) ψf. Hmm, perhaps the f and ψf are the same? Or perhaps it's a typo, maybe f is a different field.

Alternatively, perhaps f is a Yukawa coupling parameter, and ψf is the fermion field. So the interaction is between X and ψf.

So ψf is the fermion that X couples to. So ψf could be any fermion, but depends on the model.

But regardless, the possible decay products would be ψf and anti-ψf pairs, as long as their mass is within the limit.

So, assuming that the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where each has mass <=3 GeV.

So from our earlier analysis, the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but why is the option B including 'c c-bar', etc. Let's look at the options.

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e-.

But b has mass ~4.5 GeV, so 2m=9 GeV, which is greater than X's mass (6 GeV). So decay into b and anti-b is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So the c is allowed (1.5 GeV, 2*1.5=3 GeV which is allowed), and the others like s, u, d, tau, etc. So this seems correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t has mass 173 GeV, way above 3 GeV. So t is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, b's mass is too high, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but option B's first term is c c-bar, which is allowed, and others are right. So the allowed decays are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, I should check each option:

A) Has b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

B) Includes c, which is allowed. So B is possible.

C) Includes t, which is too heavy. So C is wrong.

D) Includes b, which is wrong. So D is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \), the combined rest mass of the pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses in the Standard Model
- **Quarks**:  
  - \( u \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
  - \( d \): \( \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
  - \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)  
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, \( 2m_b > M_X \))  
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, \( 2m_t \gg M_X \))  

- **Leptons**:  
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)  
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)  

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > M_X \). This option is incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+\,e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), so this option is correct.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg M_X \). This option is incorrect.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > M_X \). This option is incorrect.  

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\,e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
