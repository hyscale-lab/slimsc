Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right! The formula involves the lifetime (tau) and the velocity (beta*c) of the particle. The mean distance (L) would be L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the mean lifetime is given by the uncertainty principle, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. Let me make sure.

Right, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is the lifetime τ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I'm not entirely certain about the exact relation. Oh wait, the natural line width formula says Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's right.

Then, the mean decay distance is the product of the particle's speed (v) and the lifetime (tau). But wait, because the particle's gamma factor affects time dilation. Or wait, no, the mean lifetime is already the proper time, so the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the mean decay length is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Since tau is the proper lifetime, tau_0 = tau (as per particle's frame), then the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So the mean decay length is L = v * gamma tau_0 = beta c * gamma tau_0. That makes sense.

So, let's break it down. First, compute gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = E / (m c²), but wait, E here is the total energy. Wait, E_X is given as 8 GeV. So E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, m is given in GeV/c², right? Because E and m are related by E = m c². So m_X is 1.2 GeV, which is m_X c² =1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m_X c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667. Hmm, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.6667.

Next, beta is v/c. For a relativistic particle, beta can be found using gamma. The relationship is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let me compute that. So gamma is 6.6667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)). Let's compute gamma squared: (6.6667)^2 is approximately (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. Let me check that: 0.9887^2 is about 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604, then adding the extra. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ). Because E = gamma m c², so (m c²)^2 = (gamma^2 m^2 c^4) / (E^2) would be 1/(gamma^2). Wait, no. Wait, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

Oh right, p = gamma m v. So beta = v/c = (p c)/(E). So beta = (p c)/E. Also, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2))).

Let me compute this. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So (m/E)^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So approximately 0.9887.

So gamma is about 6.6667, beta is approximately 0.9887.

Next, compute tau, the lifetime. Tau = ħ / Gamma. Wait, Gamma is given in MeV, so 320 MeV. But ħ has units of GeV·s times some factor. Wait, I need to make sure the units are compatible.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. So tau ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Now, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

So let's compute each term:

gamma = 6.6667

beta = 0.9887

c = 3e8 m/s

tau = 2.0569e-24 s.

So L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s.

Let me compute the numbers step by step.

First, compute gamma * beta: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * approx 0.9887.

Let me calculate 6.6667 * 0.9887:

6.6667 * 1 = 6.6667.

6.6667 * 0.9887 is a bit less. Let's compute 6.6667 * (1 - 0.0113) = 6.6667 - 6.6667 * 0.0113.

6.6667 * 0.0113 ≈ 0.0755. So 6.6667 - 0.0755 ≈ 6.5912.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.5912.

Next, multiply by c: 6.5912 * 3e8 m/s = 1.97736e9 m/s.

Then, multiply by tau: 1.97736e9 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = 1.97736e9 * 2.0569e-24.

Wait, compute that: 1.97736e9 * 2.0569e-24 = (1.97736 * 2.0569) * 1e-15.

1.97736 * 2.0569 ≈ let's approximate.

2 * 2 is 4. But more accurately, 1.97736 * 2.0569.

Let me compute:

1.97736 = approx 2.0 (but a bit less)
2.0569 is about 2.057.

So 2 * 2.057 = 4.114. But since 1.97736 is 0.02264 less than 2.0, the product is 4.114 minus (0.02264 * 2.057).

0.02264 * 2.057 ≈ 0.04656.

So 4.114 - 0.04656 ≈ 4.0674.

So approximately 4.0674e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check the calculation more accurately.

Compute 1.97736 * 2.0569:

1.97736 * 2 = 3.95472.

1.97736 * 0.0569:

0.05 * 1.97736 = 0.098868

0.0069 * 1.97736 ≈ 0.013679.

So total is 0.098868 +0.013679 ≈ 0.112547.

So total 3.95472 + 0.112547 ≈ 4.067267. So about 4.0673e-15 m.

So the closest option is B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why the slight discrepancy? Let me see if I made a mistake in any step.

Let me re-calculate gamma and beta more precisely.

Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me approximate sqrt(0.9775). Let's see.

0.988^2 = (0.988 *0.988). 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604. 0.008 *0.98*2= 0.01568. 0.008^2=0.000064. So total is 0.9604 +0.01568 = 0.97608 + 0.000064=0.976144. So 0.988^2 ≈0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.

What about 0.9887^2:

(0.988 + 0.0007)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0007 + 0.0007^2.

0.988^2=0.976144.

2*0.988 *0.0007 = 0.0013832.

0.0007^2=0.00000049.

Total: 0.976144 +0.0013832=0.9775272 +0.00000049≈0.97752769. Which is just above 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887 - a little less.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. So exact value would be about 0.9887, but a very small amount less. Let's say 0.98865.

So gamma * beta is 6.6666667 * 0.98865 ≈ Let's compute that.

6 * 0.98865 =5.9319.

0.6666667 * 0.98865 ≈ let's compute:

0.6 *0.98865=0.59319, 0.0666667 *0.98865≈0.06591.

So total 0.59319 +0.06591 = 0.6591.

So 5.9319 +0.6591 =6.591.

So that's 6.591. So gamma beta is 6.591.

Wait, then gamma * beta * c tau: 6.591 *3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.0569e-24 = 6.1707e-16.

Multiply by 6.591: 6.591 *6.1707e-16 = let's compute 6*6.1707=37.0242; 0.591 *6.1707 ≈3.643.

Total about 37.0242 +3.643=40.6672e-16 m. Wait, that's 4.0667e-15 m. So around 4.067e-15 m, matching the previous calculation.

So the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

So our result is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Here, \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.0569 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.591
\]

Next, compute \( \gamma \beta c \):

\[
\gamma \beta c = 6.591 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9773 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = 1.9773 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} = (1.9773 \cdot 2.0569) \times 10^{-15}
\]

\[
L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option to \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
