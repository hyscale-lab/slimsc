Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit detection. Hmm, I remember that transits are when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 is closer to its star since shorter period means closer orbit. Their host stars have the same radius but different masses: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, and both planets have circular orbits.

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher transit probability because they have limited observing time. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, what determines the transit probability? I recall that the probability (P) is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. But wait, isn't there another factor? Oh right, the orbital distance. The transit probability also depends on the size of the star's disk relative to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no. The transit probability formula is P = (R_p / a) * (something else). Oh, right. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / a), but wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), but wait, maybe it's more precise to say that the probability is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (something). Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the transit occurs when the planet's path aligns with our line of sight.

Wait, I think the transit probability is higher for planets with smaller semi-major axes (closer in) because the chance that they pass in front of the star is higher. Because the orbital path is a circle, and for a given star size, a closer planet has a higher chance of blocking the star's light from our view.

But wait, the actual formula is P = (R_s / (a))² × (some function of inclination), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, no. I think the probability is (R_p / a) × (R_s / a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / R_s)) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but only if the planet's orbit is edge-on. Wait, no, that's not correct either.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, multiplied by the solid angle of the star. Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I'm supposed to imagine I'm a student, so perhaps I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet, the size of the star, and the size of the orbit. The formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). Because the probability is the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk, but then scaled by the chance that the planet's path is across the star's disk. Wait, that makes more sense. So P is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) multiplied by (R_s / a) )? Or perhaps more accurately, the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) ), but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another way: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So if a planet is closer (smaller a), the probability is higher because the planet is more likely to cross our line of sight. Also, the size of the planet relative to the star (R_p/R_s) affects the probability.

So the formula might be P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). Hmm, let's think about units. R_p and R_s are lengths. R_s/a is a ratio. So (R_p/R_s)^2 is dimensionless, multiplied by (R_s/a) which is (1/length), so P would be 1/length? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, I think I found somewhere that the transit probability is (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / a). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, another approach: the probability is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. The alignment probability is (R_s / a), but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ) which simplifies to (R_p^2 R_s) / (a R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Hmm. Let's see, so P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a R_s).

Wait, but maybe the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). So P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a).

Alternatively, another source I recall says that the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ), which would be (R_p^2 R_s ) / (R_s^2 a) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a).

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about this. Maybe another approach: since both stars have the same radius (R), because the question says both host stars have the same radii. Oh wait, yes. The problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is the same for both.

So for both planets, R_p is Earth-like, but I don't think their radii are given. Wait, the question says that the planets have the same mass, but not the same radius. Oh, but they are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar. Wait, but the problem doesn’t give specific radii. Hmm. But since they are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are the same, or can we assume that?

Wait, the question says the planets have the same masses. Since Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg, and if both planets have the same mass, perhaps their radii are similar. But I don't know; for the same mass, a planet with a higher density would have a smaller radius. For example, a denser planet like a rocky Earth versus a gas giant. But in this case, since they're Earth-like, perhaps they have similar radii.

Wait, but the question doesn't give R_p for either planet. So if R_p is same for both, then the transit probability depends on a and R_s. But in the problem, R_s is same for both stars. So since R_p is same, R_s same, P is proportional to 1/(a). So the closer planet (smaller a) has a higher probability.

Wait, because P is proportional to 1/(a) when R_p and R_s are same. So Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, which means smaller a. So Planet_1's a is smaller, which would make P1 higher.

Wait, but period is related to a via Kepler's third law. The period P is related to a^3 and (M_star) where M is the star's mass. So P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + planet mass)) * a^3. But since planet mass is much smaller, we can approximate P^2 proportional to a^3/(M_star). So if Planet_1 has period P1 and Planet_2 has P2 = 3 P1.

Then, using Kepler's third law:

P1^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1^3
P2^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3

Given that P2 = 3 P1, and M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting P2 =3 P1:

(3 P1)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3 → 9 P1^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3

And from P1^2 equation: P1^2 = (4π²/(G (2 M2))) a1^3 → P1^2 = (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1^3

So let's substitute P1^2 into the P2 equation. From P1^2:

P1^2 = (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1^3 → 4π²/(2 G M2) a1^3 = P1^2.

Then, substitute into 9 P1^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3:

9 * (4π²/(2 G M2) a1^3) ) = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3

Simplify left side: 9 * ( 2 π²/(G M2) a1^3 ) ) → wait, 4π²/(2 G M2) is 2 π²/(G M2).

So 9 * [2 π²/(G M2) a1^3 ] = [4 π²/(G M2) ] a2^3.

So 18 π²/(G M2) a1^3 = 4 π²/(G M2) a2^3

We can cancel π²/(G M2) from both sides:

18 a1^3 = 4 a2^3 → a2^3 = (18/4) a1^3 → a2^3 = (9/2) a1^3 → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3)

We can compute (9/2)^(1/3) → 9 is about 2.08, 9/2 is 4.5, cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So Planet_1's semi-major axis is a1, Planet_2's is a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no. Wait, since Planet_1 has a shorter period (P1 = P2/3), and the star is more massive (M1=2 M2), so a1 is smaller than a2. Let me redo the calculation to find a1 in terms of a2.

From Kepler's law, for each planet:

P1^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³ → P1^2 = (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1³

P2^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³

But P2 =3 P1 → P2² =9 P1².

So substituting into P2² equation:

9 P1² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³ → 9 (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1³ ) = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³.

Simplify:

9 * [ (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1³ ] = [4π²/(G M2)] a2³

Which is 9 * 2 (4π²/(G M2)) (a1³ / 2) ) = 4π²/(G M2) a2³.

Wait, let me compute the left-hand side:

9 * (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1³ ) = 9 * 2 * (4π²/(2 G M2)) a1³ )? No, wait:

Wait, 4π²/(2 G M2) is equal to 2 π²/(G M2). So:

9 * [2 π²/(G M2) a1³ ] = 4 π²/(G M2) a2³.

So 18 π²/(G M2) a1³ =4 π²/(G M2) a2³.

Divide both sides by π²/(G M2):

18 a1³ =4 a2³ → a2³ = (18/4) a1³ = (9/2) a1³ → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

Compute (9/2)^(1/3). 9 is 3², 2 is 2, so 9/2 = 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.6506, so a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So Planet_2's a is about 1.65 times Planet_1's a.

But earlier, I was trying to figure out the transit probability. Since the transit probability depends on ( R_p^2 / ( R_s^2 a ) ), but wait, earlier I thought that when R_p and R_s are same for both, P is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, no. Let me restate.

Transit probability, P, is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula for transit probability. From what I remember, the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_p + R_s) / (a) multiplied by something else. Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / (R_s + R_p)) )² * ( R_s / a ) ) ?

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) → which would be P = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a ). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another source I found says that the transit probability is approximately ( R_p / (R_s + R_p) )² multiplied by ( R_s / a ), but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, this simplifies to ( R_p² / R_s² ) * ( R_s / a ) ) = ( R_p² ) / ( R_s a ).

In our case, both R_p and R_s are same for both planets. So R_p1 = R_p2 (since same mass and Earth-like, assuming same radius), and R_s1 = R_s2. Therefore, P is proportional to 1/a.

So for each planet, P is inversely proportional to a, so the planet with smaller a has higher P.

Planet_1 has a smaller a than Planet_2. Wait, no, earlier calculation shows that a2 is about 1.65 a1. So a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Thus, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability because a is smaller.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

But wait, the options are given as A, B, C, D, which one says Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but the transit probability is proportional to 1/a. So the ratio of probabilities (P1/P2) is (a2/a1) because P is inversely proportional to a. Since a2=1.65 a1, then P1 = (a2/a1) * P2 → P1 = 1.65 P2 → so P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, no, because P is proportional to 1/a. So P1/P2 = (1/a1)/(1/a2) ) = a2/a1. Since a2 = 1.65 a1, then P1/P2 = 1.65.

So Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So option C is correct.

But wait, let me double-check the Kepler's law part. If M1 is twice M2, and P1 is 1/3 of P2.

So let me recast the Kepler's law.

For a star of mass M, the period squared is proportional to a³ / M.

So P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for Planet_1, P1² ∝ a1³ / M1.

For Planet_2, P2² ∝ a2³ / M2.

Given that M1 = 2 M2 and P2 = 3 P1.

So substituting:

P2² = 9 P1².

So 9 P1² = (a2³ / M2) * k, where k is the proportionality constant.

Similarly, P1² = (a1³ / M1) * k = (a1³ / (2 M2)) * k.

Substituting into P2² equation:

9 (a1³ / (2 M2) * k ) = (a2³ / M2) * k.

Cancel k and M2:

9 a1³ / 2 = a2³ → a2³ = (9/2) a1³ → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

As before, (9/2)=4.5, cube root is about 1.65.

So a2=1.65 a1. So Planet_2's semi-major axis is 1.65 times that of Planet_1.

Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to a, Planet_1's probability is higher by a factor of 1.65.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but what if the transit probability formula includes the star's radius? Because in the formula I'm considering, R_s cancels out since both stars have same R_s. So yes, transit probability is higher for Planet_1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the planet's radius \( R_p \), the star's radius \( R_s \), and the orbital distance \( a \). The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s^2 a}
\]

Given that both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, their radii \( R_p \) are assumed to be similar. Additionally, the host stars have the same radius \( R_s \). Therefore, the transit probability simplifies to being inversely proportional to the orbital distance \( a \):

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{a}
\]

From Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the star's mass \( M \) by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 \), and its host star has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 = 3P_1 \), and its host star has a mass \( M_2 \).

Using Kepler's law, we relate the semi-major axes \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) of the two planets:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 3P_1 \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{(3P_1)^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]

\[
a_2^3 = \frac{9}{2}a_1^3
\]

\[
a_2 = a_1 \cdot \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{9}{2} \) (approximately 4.5) is \( \approx 1.65 \). Thus:

\[
a_2 \approx 1.65a_1
\]

Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability of transit for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2 by a factor of:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Correct Answer:**

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
