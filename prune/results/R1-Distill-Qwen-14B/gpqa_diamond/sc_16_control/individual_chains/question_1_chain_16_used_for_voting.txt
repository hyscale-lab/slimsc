Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to determine the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state relates to the uncertainty in energy. Oh right, that's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the lifetimes given are the mean lifetimes of the states. So maybe Δt is the lifetime of each state? Or perhaps the difference in their lifetimes? Hmm, wait, no. The states have different lifetimes, but the question is about their energy difference. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be inversely proportional to their own lifetimes.

Wait, but the question is about resolving the two energy levels. That probably means that their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, we can't distinguish them.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Then, for the energy levels to be distinguishable, the actual energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or wait, maybe each state contributes its own uncertainty, so the total uncertainty is the maximum of the two, or perhaps the sum? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, no. Let me think. Each state has its own ΔE_i. The uncertainty in the energy measurement would relate to the system's ability to resolve the two states. So to clearly see a separation between E1 and E2, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (ΔE = E2 - E1) must be greater than the combined uncertainties of both states. Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but I think more accurately, the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty principle. The system's ability to measure the energy difference depends on the time it can observe the system. Wait, the problem doesn't mention any measurement time, but perhaps the lifetime of the states themselves sets the time uncertainty.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get back. Each state's lifetime is Δt. So the uncertainty in energy for each state is ħ/(2Δt). So for state 1, Δt = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). For state 2, Δt = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2e-8) = ħ/(2*1e-8). Since ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, but I usually see it in eV·s when working with eV. Let me remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.6e-19 J, so ħ in eV·s is about 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So let me calculate ΔE for each state.

For state 1: ΔE1 = ħ/(2*Δt1) = (6.58e-16 eV·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.58e-16)/(2e-9) = approx 3.29e-7 eV.

State 2: Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = (6.58e-16)/(2e-8) ) = 6.58e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, that seems off. Let me do the math again.

Wait, 6.58e-16 / (2 * 1e-9) = 6.58e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.58 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.29e-7 eV. Right, because 1e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-7.

So for state 1, ΔE ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. For state 2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so denominator is 2e-8, so 6.58e-16 /2e-8 = 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait. The lifetimes are different. So the uncertainty in energy for each state is different. But when we're measuring the energy difference between the two, which uncertainty matters?

I think the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties because each state has its own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state.

So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than about 3.6e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → way smaller than 3.6e-7. So not good.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7. So that's good.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.1e-7. Hmm, 0.1e-7 is less than 3.6e-7. So not enough.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, I'm considering the uncertainty for each state. When you have two states, the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2 and in E1 is ΔE1. So the overall uncertainty in the difference would be the sum of the two uncertainties. Because when you subtract two measured quantities, their uncertainties add.

So yes, the energy difference needs to be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So in our case, 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that.

Looking at the options: 

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 meV = 100 meV. Wait, no, meV is 1e-3 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.1 meV. But wait, 3.619e-7 eV is about 0.36 meV. So 1e-4 is 0.1 meV is less than 0.36 meV. Wait, no, wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is smaller than 3.619e-7 (which is 0.0000003619). Wait, no, 3.619e-7 is 0.3619e-6, which is 0.0000003619 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 0.0000003619 eV. So yes, 1e-4 eV is much larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So option C is much bigger, so it's a possible answer.

But wait, the options don't have 3.6e-7 eV. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger, so it's bigger than the required. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure about the calculation. Because sometimes, I get confused between the energy difference and the uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps each state has its own uncertainty, and the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the uncertainty is larger than the energy difference, then you can't tell them apart.

Wait, let me think. Suppose E2-E1 is less than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Then you can't tell them apart. If it's larger than both, then you can. Because each state's energy is uncertain, but if the actual difference is bigger than either uncertainty, then you can distinguish.

Wait, perhaps another way: the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the uncertainties are 3.29e-7 and 3.29e-8 eV, the maximum is 3.29e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than that.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001, which is larger than 3.29e-7. So 1e-4 is way bigger than 3.29e-7, so it's good.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \Delta t \), the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

For the two states in the problem:
- State 1 has a lifetime \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), so:
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]
- State 2 has a lifetime \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), so:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the combined uncertainties of the two states. The total uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we compare this required energy difference to the options provided:
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
