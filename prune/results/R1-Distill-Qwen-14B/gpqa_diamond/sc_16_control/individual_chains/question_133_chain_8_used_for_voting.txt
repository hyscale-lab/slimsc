Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we've got a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps.

Wait, but in solution, depending on the pH, different species will dominate. The presence of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 suggests that the solution is a buffer because those are two different phosphate species. KH2PO4 is the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4^-), and Na2HPO4·2H2O is the hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-). Wait, no, Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate ion. That's the completely deprotonated form, the third dissociation product of H3PO4.

Wait, but if the solution is at 25°C, that's around neutral pH. Phosphoric acid has a pKa1 around 2.12 (since pKa = -log(7.5e-3) ≈ 2.12), pKa2 around 7.21 (from Ka2=6.2e-8), and pKa3 around 11.7 (from Ka3=1.8e-12). So, at neutral pH (~7), the dominant species should be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this buffer solution. How?

I think this is a problem involving the phosphate buffer system. Since we're mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps I can consider the solution's pH and then find the concentration of PO4^3- based on that.

Wait, but I might need to calculate the pH of the solution first. Because the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the pH. At pH below pKa3 (~11.7), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because HPO4^2- would not deprotonate much.

Alternatively, another approach is to realize that in the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is a buffer between pKa2 and pKa3. Wait, no, wait: H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are adjacent species, so the buffer is around pKa2. But the PO4^3- is even more deprotonated, so maybe it's negligible in this pH range.

But let me think again. The solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; which implies that the pH is around pKa2, which is 7.21. So, the solution is likely in that range.

But how does that affect the concentration of PO4^3-? Well, the third dissociation of HPO4^2- would produce PO4^3- and H+:

HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+

But the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. That means that at pH around 7, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the solution is not strongly basic. So, we might be able to approximate it as negligible, but perhaps we should calculate it.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate. So maybe I can't ignore it, but perhaps I can calculate it based on the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the PO4^3- comes from the full deprotonation of H3PO4, but in the presence of these other phosphate species, it's minimal.

Wait, perhaps I should first calculate the molar concentrations of each phosphate species in the solution.

So, let's compute the moles of each.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but what's the concentration in solution?

The volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

So concentration of KH2PO4 is 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

Similarly, concentration of Na2HPO4 is 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Wait, but KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03668 M.

Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028065 M.

Wait, but in solution, these two will set up a buffer. Since the pH is around pKa2, which is 7.21, which is close to neutral. So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

Here, HA is H2PO4^- and A- is HPO4^2-.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) 

Plugging in the values:

pH = 7.21 + log(0.028065 / 0.03668) 

Let me compute the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.114 = 7.096.

Okay, so the pH is about 7.1.

Now, we can consider the third dissociation step:

HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The pH is 7.1, so [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

At pH 7.1, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.7), so the solution is not basic enough to deprotonate HPO4^2- into PO4^3- much. So the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low.

But the problem is to compute it. So, perhaps I can set up an expression for Ka3.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, and [H+] is 7.94e-8 M.

So, plug in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (7.94e-8)

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = 5.0517e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ (5.0517 / 7.94) * 1e-6 ≈ approx 0.636 * 1e-6 = 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.36e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial assumption is that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M. But in reality, when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces a little PO4^3-, which would decrease [HPO4^2-]. But since Ka3 is so small, the change is negligible, so we can ignore it.

So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me do it more precisely.

Compute [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (7.94e-8 )

Let me compute numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 0.028065 * 1.8e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8 = 7.94 * 1e-8.

So, 5.0517e-14 / 7.94e-8 = (5.0517 / 7.94) ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 / 7.94 ≈ 0.636.

So, 0.636e-6 = 6.36e-7 M.

But wait, the options are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Hmm, my calculation gives approx 6.36e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). But perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should use more accurate [H+] and more accurate numbers.

Let me recompute the pH more accurately.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M.

Their ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) is approximately:

We know that log(0.7) ≈ -0.1549, log(0.75)= approx -0.1249, log(0.766) = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me recall that log(0.766) = log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) + log(1e-1) = approx 0.8848 -1 = -0.1152.

Wait, that's a better estimation.

So pH = 7.21 + (-0.1152) = 7.0948, which is approximately 7.095.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.86 ≈ 8.6e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I approximated [H+] as 7.94e-8. Hmm, perhaps I should compute 10^(-0.095) more accurately.

Wait, 10^(-0.095) = approximately 0.860.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.860 = 8.6e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 7.94e-8. Hmm, perhaps I should compute 10^-7.095 more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach, 10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095).

Compute 10^(-0.095):

We know that ln(10) = 2.3026, so ln(10^-0.095) = -0.095 * ln(10) ≈ -0.095 * 2.3026 ≈ -0.2187.

e^(-0.2187) ≈ 1 - 0.2187 + (0.2187^2)/2 - (0.2187^3)/6 ≈ 

0.2187^2 ≈ 0.0478, 0.2187^3 ≈ 0.01049.

So, e^-0.2187 ≈ 1 - 0.2187 + 0.0478/2 - 0.01049/6 ≈ 1 - 0.2187 + 0.0239 - 0.00175 ≈ 1 -0.2187 is 0.7813 + 0.0239 is 0.8052 -0.00175 is 0.80345.

Wait, that's approximately 0.803. Hmm, but using a calculator, 10^(-0.095) is about 0.860? Wait, maybe there's a mistake. Because 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 10^(-0.1) is 0.8, so 10^(-0.095) would be slightly higher than 0.8, maybe around 0.86.

Wait, perhaps I should use logarithm tables or precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that [H+] ≈ 8.6e-8 M.

So, with [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.6e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.6e-8.

So, 5.0517e-14 / 8.6e-8 = (5.0517 /8.6 ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.6 ≈ 0.5874.

So, 0.5874e-6 =5.874e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 5.87e-7 M. Looking at the options, the closest is option B (5.48e-7) or option A (6.24e-7). Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]. Let me try to compute [H+] more accurately.

pH = 7.0948 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0948) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0948)

Compute 10^(-0.0948):

We can use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that 10^0.0948 ≈ 1.247 (since 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, so 0.0948 is a bit less, maybe 1.247). So 10^(-0.0948) ≈ 1/1.247 ≈ 0.802.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.802 ≈ 8.02e-8 M.

So, plugging that into [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.02e-8 )

Denominator is 8.02e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Now, 5.0517e-14 divided by 8.02e-8 is (5.0517 /8.02 ) *1e-6.

5.0517 ÷8.02 ≈ let's compute that.

8.02 × 0.629 ≈ 5.05.

Because 8.02 × 0.6 =4.812, 8.02 ×0.63=5.0526. So, 5.0517 is approximately 8.02 ×0.63 → so 0.6299.

So, 0.63 *1e-6 = 6.3e-7.

Ah, so [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.3e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7) but a little higher.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

Wait, let's compute that ratio more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M.

0.028065 / 0.03668 = let me compute this precisely.

0.028065 ÷ 0.03668 → both same units, so 28.065 /36.68 = approximately.

Well, 36.68 × 0.766 = let's see, 36.68 * 0.7 = 25.676, 36.68 *0.066= 2.423. So total 28.099. Hmm, that's close to 28.065.

So 0.766 would give 28.099, but since 28.065 is a bit less, perhaps 0.765.

So, 0.765.

Thus, log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So, pH=7.21 -0.115=7.095.

So [H+]=8.02e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.02e-8) → 5.0517e-14 /8.02e-8 → 5.0517e-14 /8.02e-8 = (5.0517 /8.02 ) * 1e-6.

5.0517/8.02 = approximately 0.63.

So, 0.63e-6 = 6.3e-7 M.

So, the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7).

But looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the concentrations I calculated are not the only source of PO4^3-.

Wait, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. But when these salts dissolve, they release H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively. However, perhaps some of the H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2- and vice versa, but given the buffer system, the major species would be those.

But wait, since PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, and we're at pH 7.1, which is well below pKa3 (11.7), PO4^3- should be minimal.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the total phosphate comes from both the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts, but PO4^3- is formed from both. Is that possible?

Wait, no, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-. But in this solution, the pH is 7.1, so the PO4^3- concentration is minimal.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that some of the HPO4^2- could deprotonate to form PO4^3-, but it's minimal.

Hmm, perhaps I should also consider that the solution could undergo hydrolysis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the orthophosphate comes from the complete deprotonation of H3PO4. But wait, in the solution, we're adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, not H3PO4. So, no, H3PO4 isn't present. So PO4^3- comes solely from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but what if the solution allows some of the H2PO4^- to deprotonate all the way to PO4^3-? No, because that would require two deprotonation steps, which is unlikely under these conditions.

So, I think the initial approach is correct: the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So, [PO4^3-] is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which gives approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is the closest.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the initial concentrations I computed are incorrect because I didn't consider the total volume correctly.

Wait, the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So for KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007336 mol. So concentration is 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005613 mol. Concentration is 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps when I calculated [HPO4^2-], I need to consider that some of it could have deprotonated to PO4^3-.

But since Ka3 is so small, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2-. So, the approximation holds.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7 M.

Wait, another way to think: perhaps the exact calculation can give a more precise value.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028065 ) / (8.02e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) *1e-12 = 0.050517e-12 =5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.02e-8.

So, 5.0517e-14 / 8.02e-8 = (5.0517 /8.02 ) *1e-6.

Compute 5.0517 /8.02 = ?

Let me compute 8.02 ×0.629 = ?

8 *0.629=5.032, 0.02 *0.629=0.01258 → sum 5.04458.

Which is very close to 5.0517. So 0.629 *8.02 is 5.04458, difference is 5.0517-5.04458=0.00712.

So, 0.00712 ÷8.02 ≈ 0.000888. So, the total is 0.629 +0.000888=0.629888.

So, 0.629888e-6 =6.29888e-7 M.

So, approximately 6.3e-7, which is 6.30e-7 M.

But the options are A)6.24e-7, which is very close.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact ratio.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0948) → let me compute this precisely.

Using a calculator: 10^(-7.0948) = 8.01e-8.

So, 8.01e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.01e-8) = (5.0517e-14) / (8.01e-8) → 5.0517e-14 /8.01e-8 = (5.0517 /8.01) ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.01 → 8.01 *0.63 =5.0523.

Wait, that's really close. So, 0.63 exactly.

So, 0.63e-6 =6.3e-7.

So, 6.3e-7, which is 6.30e-7.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Hmm, perhaps the given options are approximated, so option A would be the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species and then find the distribution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] + [H3PO4].

But since H3PO4 is not present, and PO4^3- is from the dissociation of HPO4^2-, and since the solution is buffered, the [H3PO4] is negligible.

So, the total phosphate concentration is about 0.03668 + 0.028065 + [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.064745 M.

But perhaps that's not necessary.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact pH and then find the exact [H+].

Let me try that.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

[A-] is HPO4^2-:0.028065 M.

[HA] is H2PO4^-:0.03668 M.

So, pH = 7.21 + log(0.028065/0.03668) = 7.21 + log(0.766) ≈7.21 -0.114=7.096.

So, [H+] =10^(-7.096)=8.01e-8 M.

So, plugging into the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] 

= (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.01e-8)

= (5.0517e-14) / (8.01e-8) = 6.307e-7 M.

So, 6.31e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Oh, perhaps I should be more precise.

Let me compute 0.028065 /0.03668 exactly.

0.028065 ÷0.03668 = ?

0.028065 ÷0.03668 = approximately 0.7662.

So, log(0.7662) = ?

Using a calculator, log(0.7662) is about -0.1145.

So, pH =7.21 -0.1145=7.0955.

[H+] =10^(-7.0955)= 8.01e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.01e-8) → 5.0517e-14 /8.01e-8 → 6.307e-7.

So, 6.307e-7 M, which is 6.31e-7.

But the options don't have this exact value. The closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in [H+]? Let me compute 10^(-7.0955) accurately.

Compute 10^(-7.0955) → 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0955).

Compute 10^(-0.0955).

Using a calculator: 10^(-0.0955) ≈0.800.

So, 1e-7 *0.800=8e-8.

Thus, [H+]=8e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028065 )/(8e-8) → (5.0517e-14)/(8e-8) = 6.3146e-7.

So, 6.31e-7 M.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but it's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ka3 expression.

Wait, the expression for Ka3 is correct: HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps using the exact ratio:

[HPO4^2-] = 1.00 g / (177.99 g/mol) / 0.2 L = (1/177.99)/0.2 = approx 0.028065 M.

Similarly, [H2PO4^-] = 1/136.09 /0.2= approx 0.03668 M.

Wait, when I compute the exact pH:

pH =7.21 + log(0.028065/0.03668) =7.21 + log(0.7662).

Log(0.7662) = using log(7.662e-1).

Log(7.662) =0.8848; so log(0.7662)=0.8848-1= -0.1152.

So, pH=7.21 -0.1152=7.0948.

Thus, [H+]=10^(-7.0948)= 8.02e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028065 ) /8.02e-8 →5.0517e-14 /8.02e-8= approx 6.3e-7.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer is 6.3e-7, but it's not an option. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps in the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial moles again.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol → let's compute 136.09 → 136.09.

1.00 /136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol → 0.007336 mol in 0.2 L → 0.03668 M. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O:1.00 g /177.99 g/mol → 1.00 /177.99 → approximately 0.005613 mol → 0.005613 /0.2=0.028065 M. Correct.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the given options have the answer as option D, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct approach gives a different result.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the solution, the orthophosphate comes from both the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts, but that doesn't make sense because H2PO4^- is a different species.

Wait, no, because H2PO4^- can't form PO4^3- without two deprotonations, which is unlikely under these pH conditions. Similarly, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-, which is what we calculated.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M. The closest option is A:6.24e-7.

But wait, maybe I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me compute [PO4^3-] precisely.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

[H+] =8.02e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.02e-8)

= (1.8 * 0.028065) /8.02 * 1e-12 /1e-8

= (0.050517) /8.02 * 1e-4

= 0.006306 *1e-4

=6.306e-6? No, wait, that can't be right.

Wait, 1e-12 /1e-8 is 1e-4, right. So,

(1.8e-12 *0.028065) =5.0517e-14.

5.0517e-14 /8.02e-8 = 6.303e-7.

Ah, yes, 6.303e-7 M.

So the precise value is approximately 6.30e-7.

But the options don't have that. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, but why the slight discrepancy? Maybe due to rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution isn't just [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-], but also considering the presence of other ions. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total concentration of phosphate species affects the calculation, but [PO4^3-] is a very small fraction.

I think the conclusion is that the correct answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which isn't exactly one of the options, but the closest option is A:6.24e-7.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly lower value, leading to option D.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for everything.

Let me recompute everything precisely.

Compute [H+] accurately:

pH =7.0948 → [H+] =10^(-7.0948)= ?

Let me compute 10^(-7.0948) using logarithms.

We can write 7.0948 =7 +0.0948.

So, 10^(-7.0948) =1e-7 *10^(-0.0948).

Compute 10^(-0.0948):

We can use the Taylor expansion for ln(10^x) around x=0.

But perhaps more accurately, 10^(-0.0948) = 1 /10^0.0948.

Compute 10^0.0948:

We know that 10^0.09 ≈1.23.

Wait, using a calculator approach:

log(1.23) is about 0.0899.

But perhaps using a more precise approach.

Alternatively, use natural logarithm:

ln(10^0.0948) =0.0948 * ln(10)=0.0948 *2.302585≈0.2184.

e^0.2184 ≈ 1 +0.2184 + (0.2184^2)/2 + (0.2184^3)/6.

Compute:

0.2184^2 =0.0477.

0.2184^3≈0.01046.

So,

e^0.2184 ≈1 +0.2184 +0.0477/2 +0.01046/6.

=1 +0.2184 +0.02385 +0.001743.

=1.244.

So, 10^0.0948 ≈1.244 → 10^(-0.0948)=1/1.244 ≈0.804.

Thus, [H+]=1e-7 *0.804=8.04e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028065 )/(8.04e-8)= (5.0517e-14 )/(8.04e-8 )= 5.0517e-14 /8.04e-8 = (5.0517/8.04 ) *1e-6.

5.0517 /8.04 = approximately 0.6285.

So, 0.6285e-6=6.285e-7 M.

That's more precise.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

So, the correct answer should be option A:6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ under the given conditions. The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to form PO₄³⁻ is governed by the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate the molar concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **For KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = mass / molecular weight = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol.  
  Concentration = moles / volume (L) = 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.03668 M.  
  This contributes [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.03668 M.

- **For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = mass / molecular weight = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.  
  Concentration = moles / volume (L) = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028065 M.  
  This contributes [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.028065 M.

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to estimate the pH
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) ≈ 7.21. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.028065}{0.03668}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.21 - 0.114 = 7.096
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]
The equilibrium constant is given by:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
- From the calculated pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.096} \approx 8.02 \times 10^{-8}\) M.  
- Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.02 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.02 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.30 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the given options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.30 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}\). The closest option is **A) \(6.24 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}\)**, which matches the result within reasonable rounding errors.
