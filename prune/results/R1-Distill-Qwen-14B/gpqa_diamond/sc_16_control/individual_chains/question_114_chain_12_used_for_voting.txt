Okay, I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism probably involves the formation of an enolate or something similar. But wait, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction.

Wait, but hydrocyanation usually adds HCN to a double bond. Oh wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So, perhaps it's a ketone being converted into an alcohol nitrile. I'm not sure, maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, I think the reaction is ketone + HCN. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or something else, the ketone undergoes a substitution.

Wait, another thought: the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl. So the reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition.

In a ketone, the carbonyl is attacked by the CN- nucleophile. So the product would be a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a carbonyl reacts with HCN, adding a hydroxyl and a cyano group.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the formula is C5H9ON. Wait, but 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

Butan-2-one is:

   O
   ||
CH3-C-CH2-CH3 ?

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2C=O. So when HCN adds, it would add H and CN groups.

So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Because the main chain is four carbons. Wait, but let me count: the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which has four carbons. After adding CN, we have five? Wait:

Butan-2-one: (CH3)2CO has three carbons in the chain? Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO? No, butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? So four carbons in total. So when it adds HCN, you get CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. So the name would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's the product.

So the reaction is: ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. But how is HCN provided? NaCN in the presence of an acid, probably. Because HCN is a weak acid and needs acidic conditions to generate CN-.

So for the first step, the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B), or maybe another acid like H2SO4. Looking at the options, A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. So perhaps H3O+ is the catalyst here.

Wait, but what about NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. I remember that NaHSO3 is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or acids, but wait, maybe it's used as a reagent in other reactions. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first step involves some kind of substitution. Wait, but I'm pretty sure the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, which requires acid catalysis. So A would be H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure applies here.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I know that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to produce carboxylic acids or their salts. The typical reagents are H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or NaOH (basic conditions).

But wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's likely that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. So reagent B would be HCl (acidic) or maybe another acid.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option B has B as CH3COOH, option C has B as HCl, and D has B as CH3COOH.

So in the second reaction, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, so the reagent would be HCl (acidic) or perhaps another acid catalyst.

But wait, the question says that reagent B is H2O. Wait, the second reaction is written as:

[compound] + B (H2O) → [acid]

So the reaction uses reagent B and water. So B is the catalyst. So if the reaction is hydrolysis, B would be an acid catalyst.

So in acidic conditions, H2O and HCl (B=HCl) would be used for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis under basic conditions followed by acid workup, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps B is HCl, providing the acidic conditions.

Wait, but another possibility. Maybe the nitrile is first converted to an amide, and then to a carboxylic acid. But I think in this case, it's a direct hydrolysis.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl, because HCl provides the acidic conditions needed for nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis.

So putting it together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (acid), and for the second, B is HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → matches.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → B is acetic acid, which is also an acid, but HCl is a stronger acid, maybe more suitable for hydrolysis.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → doesn't match first reaction.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → no.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I think that's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce ketones or other products. Or wait, maybe it's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

Wait, another thought. For the first reaction, perhaps the reagent A isn't H3O+ but NaHSO3. Because sometimes HCN is used with bisulfite as a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps in the first reaction, the ketone is treated with NaHSO3 and something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me think again. The first reaction is ketone + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. So the mechanism is acid-catalyzed?

Wait, the addition of HCN to ketones typically uses an acidic condition. So HCN is generated in situ, perhaps from NaCN and an acid. So A would be H3O+ (proton source), leading to HCN.

So yes, first step uses H3O+ (A) as the acid catalyst. So the first part of reagent A is correct in options A and B.

Now for the second reaction, reagent B is H2O (but as part of the reaction). So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid. The reagents are H2O and an acid catalyst, which would be HCl (so B=HCl). So option A and C have B=HCl.

Option C's A is NaHSO3. But the first reaction requires an acid, which is H3O+ (like H2SO4 or HCl, but in the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3). So I think option A is correct.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the nitrile is first converted to an amide, then to the acid. But regardless, the presence of H+ is needed for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

So I think the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the CN⁻ ion from NaCN attacks the carbonyl group of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. Such reactions typically require an acidic catalyst to generate HCN from NaCN. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid in the presence of reagent B and water. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This reaction typically occurs under acidic conditions, where HCl (a strong acid) is the most appropriate catalyst to facilitate the hydrolysis process.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weaker acid) is less suitable for the hydrolysis in the second reaction compared to HCl.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for nucleophilic addition.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
