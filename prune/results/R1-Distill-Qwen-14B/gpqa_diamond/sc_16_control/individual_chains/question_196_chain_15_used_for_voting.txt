Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass has a maximum amplitude A and is subject to Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, whether classical or quantum, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, right? Because that's when all the energy is kinetic. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so classical mechanics might not apply directly. Oh right, because in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's more complicated because of the relativistic effects.

In special relativity, the total energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy would then be E - m c² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². But for the maximum speed, the system's energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Oh wait, no, in the maximum speed point, the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium position (x=0), so the potential energy is zero. So all the energy is kinetic. But wait, no, wait—wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the amplitude A, and zero at x=0. So the kinetic energy is maximum at x=0.

Wait, but wait, when x is maximum (at A), the speed is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)k A². Then, as the oscillator moves towards x=0, the kinetic energy builds up, reaching a maximum at x=0.

But in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So the total energy E is the same throughout the motion because mechanical energy is conserved. So at x=A, E = (1/2)k A² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. But wait, at x=A, the speed is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)k A². At x=0, E is all kinetic, so E = K = (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, wait, no. Because in the relativistic oscillator, the equations change. Oh, right, because the force is not just F = -kx. The equation of motion in relativity is modified. Wait, the problem states it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -k x. So the equation of motion is d²x/dt² = -(k/m) x, but that's the non-relativistic equation. Relativistically, it's more complicated, but maybe the problem is treating the force classically but considering relativistic energy.

Wait, but perhaps I should model this using energy conservation. Let's think about it. The total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. In non-relativistic, E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)k x². But relativistically, kinetic energy is different.

So the total energy E should be (gamma m c²) + (1/2)k x². So E equals that. At the maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity v is zero. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A². Because when v is zero, gamma is 1, so kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy.

Wait, no. Wait, E is the total energy which is gamma m c² plus potential. So when v=0, gamma is 1, so E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position, x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is all kinetic. So E = gamma m c². So setting them equal:

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Because (1/2 k A²) is (k A²)/(2 m c²) * m c², right? So yeah.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we can write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha for a moment. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

Let me compute that:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha(2 + alpha).

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ alpha(2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, but let me substitute alpha back. Remember, alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

This looks a bit messy. Let me simplify the numerator and denominator.

Let me factor out 1/(2 m c²) from the terms. Let me let beta = k A²/(2 m c²). So beta is alpha.

So,

numerator inside the brackets is beta*(2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

Denominator is (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2 = c² * [ (2 beta + beta²) / (1 + beta)^2 ]

That's v squared.

But wait, let me see if I can factor this expression. Let's write the numerator:

2 beta + beta^2 = beta (2 + beta)

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2

Hmm, but perhaps I can write this as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (beta + 1)^2

Hmm, I'm not sure if that's helpful, but perhaps I can factor differently.

Wait, let's compute the expression 2 beta + beta² over (1 + beta)^2.

Let me compute (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta².

So, numerator is beta (2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

So, 2 beta + beta^2 = beta (beta + 2) = (beta + 1 + 1) beta?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute as:

(2 beta + beta²) = beta (beta + 2) = beta (beta + 1 + 1) = beta (beta +1) + beta.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator. Let me write:

(2 beta + beta^2) = beta (beta + 2)

Denominator: (beta + 1)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ beta (beta + 2) ) ] / (beta + 1)^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can write (beta +2 ) = (beta + 1) +1.

But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the entire expression.

Wait, perhaps I can write numerator as beta (beta + 2) = beta (beta + 1 + 1) = beta (beta +1) + beta.

But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Maybe think about small beta? Or perhaps the options can help me here.

Looking at the options, the answers are in terms of c times some square roots.

Option C is sqrt( (k A^2)/m ), which is non-relativistic maximum speed, so it's probably not the correct answer in the relativistic case. So probably the correct answer isn't C.

Options A, B, D involve c inside a square root, so they are relativistic.

Looking at the expression I have for v^2:

v^2 = c^2 * [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (1 + beta)^2

Wait, beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Let me denote that as (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = beta.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Let me compute this:

= c^2 * [ (beta^2 + 2 beta) ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 )

= c^2 * [ beta^2 + 2 beta ] / ( (beta + 1)^2 )

Wait, but I can factor numerator and denominator. Let me see:

Numerator: beta^2 + 2 beta = beta (beta + 2)

Denominator: (beta +1)^2.

Wait, perhaps I can write [beta (beta + 2)] / (beta +1)^2 as [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta +1).

Hmm, perhaps I can write the fraction as:

[ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta +1)^2 = [ (beta^2 + 2 beta) ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta + 1 )

= [ (beta^2 + 2 beta +1) -1 ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 )

= [ (beta+1)^2 -1 ] / (beta +1)^2

= 1 - [1/(beta +1)^2 ]

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 )

But beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta +1 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/(beta +1 )^2 = 1 / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) )^2 ]

Putting back:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2 ) )

Hmm, let me look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) )^2 )

Yes, that matches what I have here.

But wait, let's check option D. The option says:

D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Alternatively, let me compute the expression inside the square root:

1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ] where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which is 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So that's the same as [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which matches with what I had earlier.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is the same as c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

Therefore, the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me check option A. Option A is:

A) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Hmm, that looks different. Our expression doesn't have a plus, it's a minus inside the square root. So A doesn't match.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) )

Wait, but our expression is sqrt(1 - ...), so that's not matching.

So, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using energy conservation principles. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. In the relativistic regime, the total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 + \frac{1}{2}k x^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( v \) is the velocity of the mass, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the velocity \( v \) is zero, so the total energy is purely potential:

\[
E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2}k A^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the total energy is purely kinetic:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2}k A^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( m c^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces a "+" sign inside the square root, which does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it lacks the squared term in the denominator.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it represents the non-relativistic maximum speed and does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
