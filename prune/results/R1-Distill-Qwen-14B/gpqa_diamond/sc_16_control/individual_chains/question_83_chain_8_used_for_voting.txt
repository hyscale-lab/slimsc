Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the steps perfectly, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. I think I should break this down into two parts: first, finding the pH at 25% titration, and second, finding the pH at the equivalence point.

Let's start with the initial solution. When we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the concentration after dilution would be half, since the volume doubles. So concentration is 0.025 M? Let me check that.

Molarity is moles over volume. Original moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water (0.02 L), total volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find how much NaOH is added, and then calculate the pH based on the resulting solution.

Wait, what's the total volume when 25% is titrated? Or maybe it's better to calculate moles. Let's see.

Moles of acetic acid initially in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So 25% titrated means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, that will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So after adding the NaOH, the solution will have:

- Remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
- Acetate ions: 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but the volume increases due to the added NaOH. How much NaOH is added? The NaOH solution is 0.1 M, and the amount added is V. Moles NaOH = 0.1 * V = 0.00025.

So V = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. So the total solution volume is 40 mL (original) + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations now are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see. The first value in option A is 4.26, which matches this. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So moles of NaOH added equal the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 moles). So moles of NaOH = 0.001 = 0.1 M * V → V = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

The acetate ions (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So for the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], the expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is log(1/[1.04e-5]) which is 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have 9.02. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let's recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.733.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That was correct.

Wait, but when using the Kb, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M. So, Kb = 5.405e-10 = x² / 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, so pOH is log(1e-5 / 1.04) → log(9.615e-6) → approximately 5.02? Wait, no. Wait, pOH is -log([OH^-]).

Wait, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1/(1.04e-5)) → wait, no, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → which is 5 - log(1.04). Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so pOH≈4.983.

So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pHs are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7 (C), 6.92 (D). None of these are around 9, so that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the volume isn't 50 mL. Let me check.

Wait, initial solution is 40 mL. The NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles. Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 mL. So total solution volume is 40 +10=50 mL. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the Kb is calculated incorrectly. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M in acetate. So, using the formula:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, x, x.

So Kb = x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 as before. So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, none of the options have 9.0. That suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the NaOH calculation. Let me think about the equivalence point again.

Wait, the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid, 0.04 L. So moles are 0.001. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added are 0.001, so volume is 0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 mL.

Wait, but the volume of solution after adding NaOH is 40 mL +10 mL=50 mL.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, when titrating, the solution is in a flask, and the NaOH is added from a burette. So the total solution volume increases by the volume of NaOH added.

But the initial solution is 40 mL. So for the equivalence point, the total volume is 40 +10=50 mL, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of Kb is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps instead of using Kb, I should calculate the pH using the concentration of acetate.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb. Let me compute Kb again:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is equal to (1/1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= (0.5405) * (1e-9) )= 5.405e-10. So Kb is correct.

So the [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, which gives a pH of about 9.02. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution at equivalence isn't acetate but something else. Wait, no, equivalence point of a weak acid with a strong base would produce the salt of the weak acid's conjugate base and the strong base's cation. So yes, acetate and Na+.

Wait, but perhaps the calculations for pH at equivalence are wrong because I assumed that the hydrolysis of acetate is the only source of OH^-.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation, not the approximation.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02. So none of the options have this. So perhaps I messed up the initial steps.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point's calculation. Let me think: perhaps the acetic acid is being diluted and then titrated, so maybe the initial diluted solution's concentration is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate the initial diluted solution.

Original acetic acid: 20 mL of 0.05 M → 0.001 moles. After adding 20 mL of water, total volume is 40 mL → 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH must equal moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles. Volume of NaOH needed: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 mL. So total solution volume is 50 mL.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

So Kb is correct, the [OH^-] is about 1e-5, pH around 9.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Wait, perhaps the problem is not using the correct number of significant figures, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says when we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but when you titrate, the initial solution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, the equivalence point calculation: moles of acetic acid is 0.04 L *0.025 M=0.001 moles. So NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. So volume is 10 mL, as before.

So the total volume is 50 mL, so the concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, but maybe when you reach equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution, which is a basic solution. So the pH should be higher than 7, but the options don't have any pH above 8.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the pH after 25% of the acid has been titrated, not 25% of the solution.

Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which I think refers to 25% of the acid being neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I should think that at 25% titration, only a quarter of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized.

Wait, so moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001.

At 25% titration: 0.00025 moles neutralized, so 0.00075 moles left, and 0.00025 moles of acetate.

But the volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL (from NaOH addition) =42.5 mL.

So concentrations are [CH3COOH] =0.00075 /0.0425≈0.017647 M; [CH3COO^-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

pH using H-H: pKa + log([A-]/[HA])=4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.733 + log(0.333)=4.733-0.477=4.256, which matches option A's first value 4.26.

At equivalence point, I'm getting pH≈9.02, which isn't in any option. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should calculate the concentration after considering activity coefficients, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let's think about the NaOH volume again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution is CH3COO^- and Na+.

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10, as before. The concentration is 0.02 M.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] → assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10 → x≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So pOH is about 4.98 → pH=9.02. So that's correct.

But none of the options have this. Hmm. Looking back at the options, the closest is option D, which has 6.92 at equivalence. But that's way lower than 9.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation because the solution isn't just acetate ion. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized to acetate.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer solution at the equivalence point, but that can't be. No, equivalence is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's the acetate solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it another way. Maybe the moles of NaOH added is 25% of the moles needed for equivalence, but that's just the first part, which is the 25% titration.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Let me think again. If the moles of acetic acid is 0.001, then at equivalence, NaOH adds 0.001 moles. So volume is 10 mL, making total volume 50 mL. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So the pH calculation is correct.

But perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion is a weak base and the pH is about 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should compute the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a weak base. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have considered the dilution after adding the NaOH. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution's pH at equivalence is calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKb)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because pKa + pKb =14, so pH would be ½ (pKa + (14 - pKa)) ) =7. So pH=7? But that's only true for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base when the concentrations of acid and conjugate base are equal. Wait, but in this case, the concentration is 0.02 M, which is the same as the initial concentration of the acid, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again. The only option with 4.26 as the first part is option A. So if the first part is correct, then the equivalence pH must be 8.52 as per option A.

But according to my calculation, the equivalence pH is 9.02, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the initial diluted solution's concentration instead of the original concentration. Let me re-examine.

Wait, let's recalculate the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. The solution is 0.001 moles of acetate in total volume 50 mL (0.05 L). So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

So Kb for acetate is 5.405e-10.

So using the Kb expression: Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → x² = Kb * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is 4.98 → pH=9.02. So my calculation seems correct, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot that the initial solution is 0.025 M, and after adding NaOH, the solution is 0.025 M. No, that can't be right because NaOH is a strong base and neutralizes the acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again. The only option with 4.26 as the first value is A, which has 8.52 as the equivalence pH. But according to my calculation, it's 9.02. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume. Let me think again. The initial diluted solution is 40 mL. When we add 25% of the required NaOH (which is 2.5 mL), the total solution is 42.5 mL. For equivalence, it's 50 mL. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not consider the dilution when adding NaOH. That is, after adding NaOH, the solution's concentration is based on the same volume as the initial solution. No, that doesn't make sense because the NaOH has volume.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the concentration before adding NaOH. But that can't be right because the solution is getting diluted.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps the Ka was used instead of Kb. No, because for acetate, it's the base, so Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the equivalence point. But at equivalence, [HA] is zero, so the equation isn't applicable. Because for the buffer, you have both HA and A^-.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pH at equivalence is calculated using the formula for a solution of a weak base (acetate). So:

pH = pKa + pKb? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C)

Which is what I did earlier.

So, OH^- = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A has equivalence pH 8.52. Let me see what pH would correspond to that.

pH=8.52 → pOH=5.48 → [OH^-]=2.63e-6 M.

Then, Kb= [OH^-]^2 / C → (2.63e-6)^2 / 0.02 → (6.9169e-12)/0.02=3.458e-10.

But the correct Kb is 5.405e-10, so that's not matching.

Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92. That would make pOH=7.08, [OH^-]=8.18e-8. Then Kb= (8.18e-8)^2 /0.02 → (6.69e-15)/0.02=3.345e-13, which is way lower than our Kb of 5.4e-10.

So none of the options match my equivalence pH. Therefore, either I'm making a mistake or perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of acetic acid after dilution. Let me check.

Original solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M → 0.001 moles. After adding 20 mL, total volume is 40 mL → 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 =0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So solution has 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of acetate.

Total volume is 40 mL +2.5 mL=42.5 mL=0.0425 L.

Concentrations: [HA]=0.00075/0.0425≈0.017647 M; [A^-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

pH= pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → log(0.005882/0.017647)=log(0.3333)=−0.477. So pH=4.733−0.477=4.256, which is 4.26. So that matches option A's first value.

At equivalence, I'm getting pH=9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I didn't account for the dilution correctly at the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is 0.001 moles of acetate in 50 mL (0.05 L). So [A^-] =0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

The [OH^-] would be sqrt( (5.405e-10)*0.02 )= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

But no option has this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid, and when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when 40 mL * 0.025 M = V *0.1 M → V= (40 *0.025)/0.1=10 mL. So that's correct.

Wait, but what if the problem is considering the solution after titration not being 50 mL? Like, perhaps the NaOH is being added but not considering the volume? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the Kb using the exact expression without the approximation.

So Kb =5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x). Let's solve the quadratic equation.

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c=−1.081e-11.

Discriminant: b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 → (2.921e-19) +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.575e-6.

So x=(−5.405e-10 +6.575e-6)/2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approx 3.2875e-6.

Wait, wait no: 6.575e-6 is 6.575e-6, and 5.405e-10 is negligible compared to that. So x≈6.575e-6 /2=3.2875e-6 M.

Wait, that's a different result. So [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Wait, that's matching option A's equivalence pH of 8.52. So why is this different from the approximation? Because when x is not negligible compared to 0.02, the approximation isn't valid.

Oh! So I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02. But perhaps in reality, x is 3.2875e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2, so 3.2875e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. So why did the quadratic give a different answer?

Wait, let me compute the exact value again.

The quadratic equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant is 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11 + negligible → 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.575e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] / 2 → [6.575e-6 -5.405e-10 ] /2 → approximately 3.2875e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! So that's correct. So the mistake was that I assumed x is much smaller than 0.02, but in reality, the approximation isn't valid, and I must solve the quadratic. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A.

So the initial calculation was wrong because I didn't consider that x might not be negligible. Wait, but wait, 3.2875e-6 is 3.2875e-6, which is 3.2875e-6 M. 0.02 M is 2e-2 M. 3.2875e-6 is 0.0164% of 0.02, so it's very small. So why did the quadratic give a different answer? Because even a small x can have a significant impact when the Kb is very small. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, 3.2875e-6 is 3.2875e-6 M, which is 3.2875e-6 = 0.0000032875 M. 0.02 M is 0.02 M. So 3.2875e-6 is about 0.0164% of 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the original approximation should have been valid. So why did solving the quadratic give a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me recompute.

Wait, in the quadratic equation: a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant: b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*( -1.081e-11 ) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.575e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] / 2.

The positive root is [6.575e-6 -5.405e-10] /2 → approximately (6.575e-6)/2=3.2875e-6.

Wait, but 5.405e-10 is much smaller than 6.575e-6, so it's negligible. So x≈3.2875e-6.

But wait, this would mean [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

But earlier, using the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

This discrepancy is confusing. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. The quadratic equation should be Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - Kb*0.02 =0.

So a=1, b=Kb, c=-Kb*0.02.

So the discriminant is b² +4ac → (Kb)^2 +4*(1)*(Kb*0.02) → Kb(Kb + 0.08).

In our case, Kb=5.405e-10 → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(5.405e-10)*0.02 = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 =4.324e-11 + negligible → same as before.

So solving the quadratic equation gives x=3.2875e-6.

But according to this, pH at equivalence is 8.52, matching option A.

So why was the approximation method giving a different result?

Because when Kb is very small and the concentration is moderate, the approximation [A^-] ≈ C is valid. But in this case, perhaps the approximation isn't as accurate, leading to the need to solve the quadratic.

But why is the quadratic giving a different result?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to not make the approximation and solve the exact equation, leading to pH=8.52.

So the initial approach using the approximation was incorrect, but the quadratic solution is correct.

So, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So, putting it all together:

At 25% titration, pH is 4.26.

At equivalence point, pH is 8.52.

So the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation in two parts: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Solution Concentration**
We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. After diluting with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{(0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L})}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

---

### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The neutralized NaOH produces 0.00025 moles of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles, so the moles of NaOH required are also 0.001 moles. The volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \(K_b\), which is related to \(K_a\) by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH⁻]^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻} - OH⁻]} \approx \frac{[OH⁻]^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[OH⁻]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.020) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH⁻] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation for \(K_b\) without approximation gives a slightly different result:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}, \quad x^2 + K_b x - K_b \cdot 0.02 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation yields:

\[
x \approx 3.2875 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.2875 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Therefore, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
