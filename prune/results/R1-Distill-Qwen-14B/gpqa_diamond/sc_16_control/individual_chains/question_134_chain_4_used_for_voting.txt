Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy when these three solutions are mixed. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I'll need to pay attention to units.

Alright, the problem states that we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change, or delta H, is usually negative because the reaction is exothermic.

First, I think I need to determine the moles of each acid and base involved. Because HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base, so they'll neutralize each other.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. HCl is also a strong acid. So when they mix, they'll react in a neutralization reaction.

Wait, but the key here is that H2SO4 is diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 will contribute two moles of H+ ions. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will dissociate completely. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, right? Because the formula is Ba(OH)2, which means two OH- per formula unit.

So to calculate the neutralization, I think I need to find the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Whichever is in excess will determine the enthalpy, but wait, maybe first I should see which is in excess, H+ or OH-.

Let me calculate each component step by step.

Starting with HCl:

Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely to H+ and Cl-. So moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1.

Next, H2SO4:

Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, the moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2:

Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So now, compare H+ and OH-.

H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So H+ is in excess by 0.08 moles. Wait, but wait—when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but what about the excess H+? So the neutralization reaction will consume all the OH- and some of the H+ from the acids.

Wait, but the problem is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. Wait, but enthalpy of neutralization is usually defined per mole of H+ or OH- neutralized. So, the amount that actually reacts.

Wait, but in this scenario, since H+ is in excess, the limiting reagent is OH-. So all the OH- will be neutralized, and some H+ will remain.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized is equal to the moles of OH- present, which is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait, that's because each H+ reacts with each OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So the neutralization will involve 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, and the excess H+ is 0.08.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is typically around -57 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, but I might get exact conversion wrong here). Wait, let me double-check. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Or, more precisely, per mole of H+ or OH-.

So, because we have 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me check the units. The options include both kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful.

Alternatively, sometimes the value is given as -13.6 kcal per mole, because 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ; 57 /4.184 ≈13.6).

Wait, let me compute that. 57 kJ is equal to 57,000 J. To get kcal, divide by 4184 (since 1 kcal = 4184 J). 57,000 /4184 ≈13.61 kcal. So yes, about -13.6 kcal per mole of H+ neutralized.

So, for 0.2 moles, that would be 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait—what about the H2SO4? Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, the second H+ is a weaker acid, but in strong acid solution, it's considered to dissociate completely as well. So in the initial calculation, I considered both H+ from H2SO4. So my initial calculation should be correct.

But wait, the problem is that when you mix these together, the Ba(OH)2 will neutralize the H+ from both HCl and H2SO4. So the total H+ available is 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2, so all the OH- will react, and 0.08 H+ remains.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated based on the moles of H+ neutralized. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized by OH-.

Thus, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options: option A is -2.72 kcal, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ, since 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (because 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). Hmmm, that's confusing.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me re-examine. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 moles would be -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have -11.42 kJ as option B, which is about -11.4 kJ. So that would be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was -2.72 kcal, which would be option A.

Wait, which is right? Because the options have both. So I need to clarify the exact value of the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So for 0.2 moles, that would be -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16 kJ (no), option B is -11.42 kcal? Wait, no, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, looking back:

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, wait: if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, then 0.2 moles would be -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm, but option B is about -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -57 kJ.

Wait, because 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal (as I thought earlier). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ is 11400 J; 11400 /4184 ≈2.72 kcal).

Wait, but that's conflicting. So if I calculate in kJ, it's -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option as a kJ value except option D is -16.0 kJ. Or wait, no, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess. Then, the neutralization is based on the limiting reagent.

But wait, another approach: the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O; ΔH = -57 kJ/mol.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.28. Moles of OH-: 0.2.

So, the OH- is the limiting reagent, as I thought before. So 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, giving 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ. That's the enthalpy change.

But the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match, and B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, maybe I confused the units.

Wait, 0.2 moles × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ, which is approximately option B (-11.42 kcal) if it's converted to kcal. Wait, no. If -11.4 kJ is in kJ, but option B is in kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in kcal, so 0.2 moles × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but that would require using the value in kcal. So which is correct? Because in the problem statement, the options mix both units.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ/mol (H+), which is about -13.6 kcal/mol. So 0.2 moles × (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is option D (-16 is not right, so perhaps none of the options are correct. Wait, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl gives 1 H+ per mole, so 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18.

Total H+ = 0.28. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2. So OH- is limiting.

So moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2.

So using the standard value of -57 kJ per mole, that's 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have an option for -11.4 kJ as the answer except perhaps option D is -16, which is wrong.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately equal to -11.4 kJ? No, wait. Let me compute the exact conversion.

1 kcal = 4184 J.

So 1 kJ = 1000 J = 0.239 kcal (because 1000 /4184 ≈0.239).

So, 11.4 kJ = 11.4 × 0.239 = approximately 2.72 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles × (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

Wait, that makes sense. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because that would be if I considered all the H+ (0.28 moles) being neutralized, which isn't the case. Because the OH- is only 0.2 moles, so only 0.2 moles of H+ react.

So, the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, contributing \( 2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ per mole of H₂SO₄} \), so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing \( 2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂} \), so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Neutralization reaction:**
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ react in a 1:1 ratio: \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).
   - **Limiting reagent:**  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reagent because there are only \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \), while there are \( 0.28 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).  
     Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

4. **Enthalpy of neutralization:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ per mole of H⁺ neutralized} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal per mole of H⁺ neutralized} \).
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ neutralized} \):  
     \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Final answer:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.

**Critical analysis of options:**  
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not account for the correct unit conversion from kJ to kcal.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

**Answer: A**
