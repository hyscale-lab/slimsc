Okay, so I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Hmm, let me think. The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphoric acid salts, right?

Wait, I remember that orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it goes through several steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). Then H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? No, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can lose H+ to become H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. So the question is asking for orthophosphate, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

But wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but maybe in solution, the predominant form is HPO4^2- after the second dissociation. Or maybe it's the sum of all the species? Hmm, perhaps I should look up what exactly is considered orthophosphate ion in this context. But I think in this case, the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write down the formulas:

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4). Wait, no, wait: the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, but when dissolved, the water is just part of the hydrate and dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2- along with H2O. So, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 2 moles of Na+ and 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Because both are present, this would form a buffer solution. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the relevant pKa is Ka2 (since H2PO4^- loses a H+ to become HPO4^2-). Looking at the given Ka values, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.207 (since log(6.2)=0.79, so 0.79-8=7.21).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8. The pKa is -log10(6.2e-8). Let's calculate:

log(6.2) is about 0.7924. So log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Now, the concentrations of the acid (H2PO4^-) and base (HPO4^2-):

We have 1.00 g of each substance. Let's compute the moles.

For KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol. So 0.007345 moles of H2PO4^-.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005608 mol. Each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-, so 0.005608 moles of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.

So concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005608 / 0.2 = 0.02804 M.

Now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.2076 + log(0.02804 / 0.036725).

Compute the ratio: 0.02804 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.763.

So log(0.763) is about -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.116 = 7.0916.

Wait, but wait: the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So the concentration is [HPO4^2-], which is 0.02804 M. But wait, that's under the initial assumption without considering dissociation. Hmm, but in reality, the presence of H+ will affect the level of dissociation. Wait, no, because the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations are as given. Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the dissociation of H2PO4^- in solution.

Wait, wait a minute. The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in a certain ratio, which determines the pH. But the actual concentration of HPO4^2- would be affected by the pH and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. In a buffer solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the ratio of the concentrations, but the actual concentrations can be calculated from the moles. Because the moles are fixed (0.007345 and 0.005608), the concentrations are as I computed. So the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M. But wait, that's not correct because H2PO4^- can dissociate further to form HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The solution contains H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O). The pH of the solution is determined by the buffer system, which is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2-. Because orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it loses a H+ to become H2PO4^-, and so on. Wait, no. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated species, but maybe I'm mixing terms. Alternatively, orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion.

Alternatively, the question could be referring to all phosphate species, but I'm not sure. But based on the way the problem is given, I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but let me think again. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation gives H2PO4^-, the second gives HPO4^2-, and the third gives PO4^3-. So HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- is the hydrogen phosphate. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the orthophosphate ion would be HPO4^2-.

So the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) is 0.02804 M. But wait, that's under the assumption that all the Na2HPO4·2H2O is dissociated, which it is, because it's a soluble salt. So in solution, the initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02804 M. Similarly, H2PO4^- is 0.036725 M.

But wait, that's the initial concentration. Then, the H2PO4^- can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-. So the actual [HPO4^2-] will be higher than 0.02804 M because some H2PO4^- will dissociate.

Ah, right, this complicates things. So I can't just take the initial concentrations because the H2PO4^- will contribute more HPO4^2-.

Hmm, so I need to set up an equilibrium.

Let me denote:

Initial concentrations:
[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M

Change: Let x be the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the change would be:

[H2PO4^-] decreases by x → 0.036725 - x
[HPO4^2-] increases by x → 0.02804 + x
[H+] increases by x → x

But wait, this might not be the right approach because the solution is a buffer, so pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which in turn affects the extent of dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pH of the solution is what I calculated earlier, around 7.09. Wait, wait, earlier calculation: pH = 7.0916.

Now, the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but given the pH, I can find the [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.0916) ≈ 8.01e-8 M.

The dissociation of H2PO4^-: H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

The equilibrium expression is Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].

We have Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

So, plug in the known [H+], and solve for [HPO4^2-].

Ka2 = (8.01e-8) [HPO4^2-] / (0.036725 - x) ≈ 6.2e-8.

Wait, but wait: the [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 - x, but since x is small compared to 0.036725, because Ka2 is small, x should be small. So we can approximate [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.036725.

So, [HPO4^2-] ≈ (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 =6.2e-8, [H2PO4^-] =0.036725, [H+]=8.01e-8.

So,

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 8.01e-8.

Let me compute numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.036725 ≈ 2.27e-9.

Divide by 8.01e-8: 2.27e-9 /8.01e-8 = 2.27/(8.01) * 1e-1 ≈ 0.2836 *0.1 ≈0.02836 M.

Wait, but that seems similar to the initial [HPO4^2-], which was 0.02804 M. So the contribution from dissociation is minimal, which makes sense because Ka2 is small and pH is close to pKa2.

Wait, but the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804, and from dissociation, it increases by 0.02836 -0.02804= approx 0.00032, which is small compared to the initial. So, the total [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02804 + 0.02836 = 0.0564 M? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, because the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M, and the dissociation adds x, where x is given by:

x = [HPO4^2-] added due to H2PO4^- dissociation.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier gives [HPO4^2-] as 0.02836 M. So, the total [HPO4^2-] is initial 0.02804 plus x, where x is from dissociation.

But wait, I'm getting mixed up here. Let me correct this. The initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M. Then, H2PO4^- dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So, let me denote the change as x, where x is the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates. Then:

At equilibrium,

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 - x

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 + x

[H+] = 8.01e-8.

Now, the Ka2 expression is:

Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-])/([H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the values:

6.2e-8 = (8.01e-8 * (0.02804 + x)) / (0.036725 -x )

But since x is small, we can approximate 0.02804 +x ≈ 0.02804 and 0.036725 -x ≈ 0.036725. Let's try this approximation first.

So,

6.2e-8 = (8.01e-8 *0.02804)/0.036725.

Calculate RHS:

8.01e-8 * 0.02804 ≈ 2.247e-9.

Divide by 0.036725: 2.247e-9 / 0.036725 ≈ 6.120e-8.

But 6.120e-8 is less than 6.2e-8. So, the approximation is close but not exact. So, perhaps the actual x is a bit larger.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

6.2e-8 = (8.01e-8 * (0.02804 + x)) / (0.036725 - x )

Multiply both sides by (0.036725 -x ):

6.2e-8 (0.036725 -x ) = 8.01e-8 (0.02804 + x )

Expand both sides:

6.2e-8 *0.036725 -6.2e-8 x = 8.01e-8 *0.02804 +8.01e-8 x.

Compute each term:

6.2e-8 *0.036725 = approx 6.2 *0.036725 = 0.228125, so 0.228125e-8.

8.01e-8 *0.02804 = approx 8.01 *0.02804 ≈ 0.2246, so 0.2246e-8.

So,

0.228125e-8 -6.2e-8 x = 0.2246e-8 +8.01e-8 x.

Bring like terms together:

0.228125e-8 -0.2246e-8 = (8.01e-8 x +6.2e-8 x )

0.003525e-8 = 14.21e-8 x.

So,

x = 0.003525e-8 /14.21e-8 = (0.003525 /14.21 ) * 1e-8 /1e-8.

Wait, let's compute this correctly.

0.003525e-8 is 3.525e-10.

14.21e-8 is 1.421e-7.

So,

x = (3.525e-10) / (1.421e-7) = (3.525 /142.1) * 1e-3.

3.525 /142.1 is approximately 0.02479.

So, x ≈ 0.02479e-3 = 2.479e-5 M.

So, x is about 0.00002479 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 + x ≈ 0.02804 + 0.00002479 ≈ 0.028065 M.

Wait, that's a very small increase, so the initial approximation was close.

So, [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028065 M.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So that's about 0.028 M, but let me check the options.

Wait, the options are around 1e-7 M, which is much smaller than 0.028 M. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, what's wrong here. Oh! Wait a minute, maybe I mixed up the units. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the given mass for each compound is 1.00 g. For KH2PO4, Mw is 136.09 g/mol, so moles = 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005608 mol.

Volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005608 / 0.2 = 0.02804 M.

Wait, so the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M. Then, the H2PO4^- dissociates a little, adding about 0.00002479 M, making HPO4^2- about 0.028065 M.

But the options are 6.24e-7, 5.48e-7, etc., which are way lower than 0.028 M. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- (phosphate ions) instead of HPO4^2-.

Because PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion? Or is it HPO4^2-?

Wait, I'm getting confused about the terminology. Let me clarify.

H3PO4 is orthophosphoric acid. Upon first deprotonation, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). Second deprotonation gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (phosphate ion).

So, the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-?

Wait, no. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's deprotonated. So perhaps in solution, the orthophosphate refers to the conjugate base. But I'm a bit stuck on the terminology.

Wait, the problem specifically asks for orthophosphate ions. I'm pretty sure that in this context, orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion, which is the dihydrogen phosphate. Because orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4) is the fully protonated form, and HPO4^2- is the second deprotonated form, which is referred to as dihydrogen phosphate, but sometimes called orthophosphate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phosphate ion (PO4^3-) as orthophosphate. But that's less likely because PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, which is less common in solution unless pH is very high.

Wait, let me think again. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

If the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-, then the concentration would be 0.028 M, but the options are way lower. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the concentration of phosphate ions in the solution, not considering the buffer. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the solution is a buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- as well.

Wait, no, HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+, but in the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around 7, which is higher than pKa3 (~12). So at pH 7, PO4^3- would be negligible.

Wait, but wait, the buffer is around pH 7.09. pKa3 is 12, so the solution is well below that. So PO4^3- concentration is negligible.

So, the concentration of orthophosphate, if it's HPO4^2-, is about 0.028 M. But the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is way lower.

Hm. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about a buffer but about the total phosphate concentration. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the contributions.

Wait, another approach: the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all phosphate species: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in solution, H3PO4 is negligible because it's a weak acid and would fully dissociate in water, but given the presence of its conjugate base, it might not. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- (phosphate ion), which is the fully deprotonated form, but that would be very low.

Wait, let me think: for each species, the concentration can be found using the dissociation constants.

But given that the solution is a buffer, the pH is about 7.09, as calculated earlier.

Now, let's find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.02804 M, [H+] =8.01e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.01e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 ≈ 5.047e-14.

Divide by 8.01e-8: 5.047e-14 /8.01e-8 ≈6.3e-7 M.

Ah! That's about 6.3e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M) and option D (3.97e-7).

Wait, but the problem asks for orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, then the concentration is 6.3e-7 M. That's close to option A.

But I'm not entirely sure if orthophosphate refers to PO4^3- or HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the terminology. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the corresponding ion after losing three H+ would be PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate ion. So, in this context, the problem is asking for [PO4^3-].

So, the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 M

C)2.81e-7 M

D)3.97e-7 M.

So, 6.3e-7 is close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M.

[H+] is 8.01e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804 ) / 8.01e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8 * 0.02804 = 0.050472. So, 0.050472e-12.

Denominator: 8.01e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = 0.050472e-12 / 8.01e-8 = (0.050472 /8.01) * 1e-4.

0.050472 /8.01 ≈ 0.006299.

So, 0.006299 * 1e-4 = 6.299e-7 M.

So, approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M).

So the answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The relevant dissociation steps for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) are:

1. **H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻** (Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³)  
2. **H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻** (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸)  
3. **HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻** (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²)  

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol). The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L).  

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes 0.007345 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005608 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes 0.005608 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Initial concentrations in solution
- \([H₂PO₄⁻]\):  
  \[
  [H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007345}{0.200} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}
  \]

- \([HPO₄²⁻]\):  
  \[
  [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005608}{0.200} \approx 0.02804 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution forms a buffer with H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]  
Here, \(K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), so:  
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076
\]  
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log \left(\frac{0.02804}{0.036725}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.2076 - 0.116 = 7.0916
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([PO₄³⁻]\) using \(K_a₃\)
Orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) arise from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} ⇌ \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]  
The equilibrium constant is \(K_a₃ = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\). Using the expression:  
\[
K_a₃ = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a₃ [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0916} \approx 8.01 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02804)}{8.01 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.047 \times 10^{-14}}{8.01 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(PO₄³⁻\)) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option **A (6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M)**.

ANSWER: A
