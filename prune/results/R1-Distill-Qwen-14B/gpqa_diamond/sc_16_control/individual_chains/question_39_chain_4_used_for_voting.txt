Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. 

The problem states that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. But when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the wave function isn't necessarily zero, but the probability of finding the particle is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must have nodes or something beyond that region, but wait, that's not exactly how it works. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that seems a bit odd because a wave function typically has both real and imaginary parts, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Or maybe the wave function is written as a complex function, but the problem is about the modulus squared, which gives the probability density. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. But wait, that's a bit strange because usually, the wave function would have a form that goes to zero beyond certain regions (like an infinite potential well). But in this case, it's given as a function that might not necessarily be zero beyond x=1 or x=3.

Wait, but the measurement shows that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the probability of finding the particle outside this interval is zero. That means the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. So for x <1 or x>3, the wave function is zero. 

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that suggests that the wave function is non-zero outside 1 and 3? But the measurements show that particles are only found between 1 and 3. So that suggests that the wave function should be zero outside that interval. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and outside that region, the wave function is zero. Because if that's the case, then the wave function is non-zero (as given) only between 1 and 3. So the given function is the part inside the well, and zero otherwise. 

But wait, the problem says that when measuring, particles were only found between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid in the 1<x<3 region, and zero elsewhere. 

But in that case, the wave function is a valid solution to the Schrödinger equation in this region and zero outside. So that makes sense. So the wave function is non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. So the function given must satisfy the boundary conditions at x=1 and x=3, such that the wave function is continuous, and perhaps the derivative is also continuous (depending on the potential).

Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside, then at x=1 and x=3, the wave function should be zero. So let me think: for x=1, the given function is a/sqrt(1+1) -0.5i = a/sqrt(2) -0.5i. But if the wave function is zero at x=1, then this function must be zero. So that would require a/sqrt(2) = 0 and -0.5i =0, which isn't possible. Hmm, that can't be right. So that suggests that the given wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, but the function as given doesn't go to zero at x=1 or x=3. So maybe I've misunderstood the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is expressed as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) multiplied by some function that is 1 between 1 and 3 and zero otherwise. But the problem gives the wave function as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the wave function is purely imaginary outside the region, but that seems more complicated than necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the function given is the part within the region, and the rest is zero.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is only for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. So in that case, the wave function is non-zero in that interval and zero outside. Then, the problem is to find 'a' such that the wave function is normalized, i.e., the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the probability density (|ψ|^2) over all space must equal 1. So, if the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, then the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx must equal 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i, but only for 1 ≤ x ≤3. So the modulus squared is |ψ|^2 = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you have a complex number a + ib, the modulus squared is a² + b².

Wait, because the wave function is a real part plus an imaginary part. So |ψ|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, because the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in terms of real and imaginary parts: real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that can't be right because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5, so |ψ|² is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that's a bit strange because it's not a typical wave function. Usually, the wave function would be purely real or purely imaginary, but here it's a combination. But perhaps that's acceptable; the wave function can be complex. But I'm a bit confused because for a free particle, the wave function is typically a plane wave, but in this case, it's a specific form.

But regardless, the approach is to compute the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute each part separately. 

First part: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second part: ∫ (0.5)^2 dx from 1 to 3. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. The integral over x is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding the two parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but wait a second. If the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then when we take the modulus squared, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part is -0.5, so when you square it, it's (0.5)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a complex number. So the modulus squared is [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2.

But integrating that from 1 to 3, so yes, that's correct.

So I think my calculation is correct. So a is approximately 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of "a" in the wave function of the particle, given that the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and zero outside this interval. The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1 (normalization condition):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

### Step 1: Split the integral
The integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

### Step 2: Compute the first integral
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Step 3: Compute the second integral
The second integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Adding the two parts gives:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Simplify for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

### Step 5: Approximate \( \ln(2) \) and solve for \( a \)
Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
