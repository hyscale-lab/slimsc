Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh right, I think λf is the coupling constant, ψ_f is the fermion field, and X(y) is the boson field. So this term must represent the interaction between the boson X and the fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each of the fermions. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the total energy is enough to create the two particles. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if 6 GeV is more than twice their mass.

Wait, but wait. The fermions in the Lagrangian must be the ones that X can interact with. Because if the interaction isn't there, the decay isn't possible. So the fermions that appear in the Lagrangian are the possible decay products.

Looking back at the Lagrangian: the term is proportional to (v + X(y)), so the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So ψ_f must be the fermions that X can couple to. So which fermions are these?

The fermions ψ_f could be quarks and leptons, but which ones? The options include various quarks and leptons. So I need to figure out which fermions are light enough that 6 GeV is more than twice their mass.

Let me list the fermion masses. I remember the approximate masses:

- Up and down quarks: about 2-5 MeV each. So 2*m_u ≈ 4 MeV, way less than 6 GeV.
- Strange quark: about 95-100 MeV. 2*m_s ≈ 200 MeV, which is 0.2 GeV, much less than 6 GeV.
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV. 2*m_c ≈ 3 GeV. So 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV. 2*m_b ≈ 9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 GeV is more than 6, so X cannot decay into b b-bar. So any option including b quarks would be wrong.

Wait, but the boson mass is 6 GeV. So for the decay into a pair, each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV. Let's see:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV. So 2*m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV, which is way less than 6. So e+ e- is allowed.
Muon: ~0.1 GeV. 2*m_mu ≈ 0.2 GeV. Allowed.
Tau: ~1.78 GeV. 2*m_tau ≈ 3.56 GeV. Hmm, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 3.56 is more than 3 GeV but less than 6. So 3.56 < 6, so tau pair is allowed.
Wait, 2*1.78 GeV is 3.56 GeV. So 6 GeV is larger than that, so decay into tau pair is allowed.

What about the other quarks:

c quark: mass ~1.5 GeV. 2*m_c=3 GeV <6 GeV. So c c-bar is allowed.

But bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So b quark decays are not allowed.

Wait, but wait, what about the top quark? Its mass is about 173 GeV. But 2*m_t is way over 6 GeV, so top can't be in the decay.

So the possible fermion pairs for the decay would be:

c c-bar: allowed.
s s-bar: allowed.
u u-bar: allowed.
d d-bar: allowed.
tau+ tau-: allowed.
mu+ mu-: allowed.
e+ e-: allowed.

So what about the options:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed because 2m_b is more than X's mass. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all allowed. So B is possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and t. But t is way too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct option would be B. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed fermion pairs. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait: the fermions in the Lagrangian are ψ_f. Are all these fermions included in the Lagrangian? Because the Lagrangian's interaction term is with ψ_f. But the problem states that the interaction is given by L(y) = ... which includes ψ_f. So I think ψ_f could be all the fermions, but perhaps only charged leptons and quarks are considered.

But the problem says f is a fermion, so I think in this case, the X boson can couple to all the fermions listed in the options. Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem specifies which fermions ψ_f are. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which is a fermion, but without knowing which type. So perhaps the X can interact with all possible fermions, but kinematically only the light enough ones can be decay products.

But in reality, the couplings may be such that only certain fermions are present. For example, X could be a gauge boson coupling only to certain fermions, like in the Standard Model. For instance, the W boson only couples to left-handed fermions. But in this problem, the Lagrangian is given as a general interaction, so maybe it's allowed for any fermion.

Wait, but the problem states "what are the kinematically allowed decays". So regardless of the coupling, whether the fermion is present in the interaction, the mass is the only factor. Wait, no, because if the fermion isn't in the interaction term, X can't decay into it. So the interaction term must include the fermions for decay to be possible.

Wait, the interaction term is L = -λf f-bar ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f is the fermion field, and the term is for each fermion. So for each fermion ψ_f, there's an interaction term. So X can decay into any of these ψ_f and their antiparticles, as long as the mass allows.

But in the problem statement, which fermions are included? The problem doesn't specify, but the options are given. So the possible decay options must be all the fermions that are light enough.

So from the options, only option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So option B is the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f (y) \left( \upsilon + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( \psi_f \) represents fermion fields. For \( X \) to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. The boson mass \( m_X \) must be at least twice the fermion mass (\( m_X \geq 2m_f \)).
2. The fermion must be included in the interaction term of the Lagrangian.

From the given options, the fermion masses are approximately:

- \( m_u, m_d \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_u, 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( m_s \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( m_\mu \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \)).

From these, the fermions \( c, s, u, d, \tau, \mu, e \) satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), while \( b \) and \( t \) do not. Additionally, the interaction term in the Lagrangian allows \( X \) to decay into any fermion \( f \bar{f} \) that satisfies the mass condition. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy the mass condition. Hence, B is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, D is incorrect.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are given in **Option B**.
