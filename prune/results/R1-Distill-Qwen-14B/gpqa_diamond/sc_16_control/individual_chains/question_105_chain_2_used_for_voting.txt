Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and how they affect the brightness of a star, and how that compares to the effect of an exoplanet. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a 20% filling factor. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view periodically, causing the star's brightness to vary. The question is, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Wait, so the key here is to compare the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by spots with that caused by a planet. The amplitude of the light curve depends on the area blocked and the temperature differences.

First, let's model the star's brightness without spots. The star emits light based on its surface area and temperature. The total luminosity (L) of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4, where R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and Teff is the effective temperature.

When there are spots, the star's observed brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the total brightness decreases. But to find the amplitude of this variation, I need to calculate the difference in flux before and during the spot coverage.

The flux from the star without spots is F = σTeff^4. The flux from the spot is σ(Teff - ΔT)^4, where ΔT is 1000K. But wait, the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. So their flux is lower.

The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. Wait, but how much of the star's surface do the spots cover in total?

Wait, the star is a sphere, so one hemisphere is half the surface. The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²/2) )? Wait, no. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So that's the area of the spots, right?

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots will be visible when they're facing us. The brightness variation would be the difference between when no spots are visible and when the maximum number of spots is visible.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots will come into view and then go out of view. The maximum dip in brightness occurs when the maximum area of spots is blocking the light. But since the star is a sphere, when the spots are on the side we're looking at, the area we're blocking is the area of the spots as seen from Earth.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the fraction of the star's disk blocked by the spots. The area of the star's disk is πR² (since we see it as a circle with radius R). The area of the spots is 0.4πR², as calculated earlier. So the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots is 0.4πR² / πR² = 0.4, or 40%. So when the spots are fully visible, 40% of the star's disk is covered by cooler regions.

But wait, no. Because the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. Let me think again. The star's surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spot area is 0.4πR². So when the star is viewed such that the entire spot area is visible (i.e., the entire hemisphere is facing us), the fraction of the star's disk blocked is 0.4πR² / (πR²) ) = 0.4. So 40% of the star's disk is covered by spots.

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots are on the limb (edge) of the disk, so the fraction of the area blocked is the same as the spot area divided by the star's disk area. So 0.4.

Now, to compute the change in brightness. The star's flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The spots have a flux F_spot = σ(Teff - delta_T)^4, where delta_T is 1000K. So the flux per unit area from the spots is (F_spot) / (area per unit area) = σ(5000)^4.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πR²) / (4π) )? Wait, maybe I should think this differently. The star's total flux is F_star = σTeff^4 * (4πR²) / (4π) )? Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the star's total flux as F = (sigma * Teff^4) * (Area of the star's surface) / (4π) ), because the star emits over its entire surface.

Wait, perhaps I should model the total flux as the sum of the normal parts and the spotted parts. So when spots are present, the total flux is F = F_normal * (1 - f) + F_spot * f, where f is the fraction of the area covered by spots. Because without spots, the flux is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2. But wait, that seems off.

Wait, no. The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the power emitted per unit area as sigma T^4. So the total power (luminosity) is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

But when part of the surface is at a different temperature, the total flux observed is the sum of the flux from the normal regions and the spots. So the fraction of the surface that's normal is (1 - f), and the fraction that's spots is f.

So the total flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 / Teff^4 + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4 / Teff^4 ].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The flux without any spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4. The flux when spots are present is F = (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 + f * sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4. But wait, because the area of the star as seen from Earth is pi R^2, and the total flux is F = (sigma * Teff^4) * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2. But when spots are present, the flux is F = [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma R^2. So the relative change in flux is delta_F / F0 = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1.

Wait, that's correct. So delta_F is F - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 ] - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 - 1 ] = F0 [ -f + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 ].

So the fractional change is deltaF/F0 = [ (1 - f) (Teff^4) + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1 = [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 ] - 1 = [ (1 - f) + f ( (5000/6000)^4 ) ] - 1.

Wait, substituting Teff=6000K, delta_T=1000K, so (5000/6000)^4.

So f is the fraction of the area covered by spots, which is 0.4, as calculated earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere. Each hemisphere is half the star's surface area. So the area covered is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 pi R^2. The total area of the star is 4 pi R^2. So f = (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the entire star's surface is 4 pi R², and the spots cover 0.4 pi R². So the fraction f is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1, or 10% coverage. So f = 0.1.

Ah, so that's a critical point. I think I assumed f was 0.4, but it's actually 0.1. Because the star's surface is 4 pi, and the spots take up 0.4 pi, so 0.4/4 = 0.1.

So back to the fractional change:

deltaF/F0 = [ (1 - 0.1) * 6000^4 + 0.1 * 5000^4 ] / 6000^4 -1.

Calculate each term.

6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16.

5000^4 is (5e3)^4 = 6.25e15.

So:

(0.9 * 1.296e16) + (0.1 * 6.25e15) = ?

0.9 * 1.296e16 = 1.1664e16.

0.1 * 6.25e15 = 6.25e14.

Adding these: 1.1664e16 + 6.25e14 = 1.2289e16.

Divide by 1.296e16: 1.2289e16 / 1.296e16 ≈ 0.949.

So deltaF/F0 = 0.949 - 1 = -0.051, so about a 5.1% decrease in flux when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but wait, the star's flux when the spots are visible is lower than when they're not. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, but in reality, the maximum flux is F0 (when no spots are visible), and the minimum is when the maximum area of spots is visible. So the amplitude is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = (F0 - F_min)/F0.

So F_min is when all spots are visible, which is 0.949 F0. So the amplitude is (F0 - 0.949 F0)/F0 = 0.051, or 5.1%.

But wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the expression I had earlier was F = (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4, all multiplied by sigma, but F0 is sigma Teff^4. So deltaF = F - F0 = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma - sigma Teff^4 = sigma [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 - Teff^4 ].

Which is sigma Teff^4 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 -1 ].

So the fractional change is deltaF/F0 = [ (1 - f) (Teff^4) + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1.

Which is [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 ] - 1.

So simplifying this, it becomes -f + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4.

Which is f [ ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 - 1 ].

So for f=0.1, (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So (0.4823 -1) = -0.5177.

Then f * (-0.5177) = 0.1 * (-0.5177) ≈ -0.0518.

So the fractional change is about -5.18%, which is a 5.18% decrease in flux when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation is similar to that caused by an exoplanet. So what's the amplitude caused by a planet?

When a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks a part of the star's light. The flux drops by an amount proportional to the area blocked. The area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a disk.

So the fractional change in flux would be (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So if the star's flux variation amplitude is 5.18% due to the spots, the planet's would have the same amplitude if (R_planet/R_star)^2 = 0.0518.

So R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the star's case, the flux goes down when the spots are visible, but the planet causes a dip of the same order. So the planet's effect is a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2, which should match the star's dip of about 5.18%.

Wait, but wait, the star's dip is 5.18%. So we set (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0518.

So R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, 0.2278 is approximately 0.23, which isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the spot coverage.

Wait, let me re-examine the spot coverage. The question says the star's one hemisphere is covered with dark spots of a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere surface area). Hemisphere surface area is 2 pi R^2. So spots area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

But the total surface area of the star is 4 pi R². So f = 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1, or 10%. Which is correct.

But wait, when the star is rotating, the spot may come into view as a limb effect. Wait, no, because the entire hemisphere is spotty, so when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere facing us is the spotty one, so 10% of the entire star's surface is covered. So when the spots are fully visible, the area blocked is 10% of the star's disk area, which is (R_s)^2 * 0.1.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the fractional change in flux as 5.18%, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, let me recheck the fractional change.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

So f = 0.1.

deltaF/F0 = f * [ ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 - 1 ].

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^4 = ?

0.833333^2 is approximately 0.694444.

0.694444^2 = about 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So [(5/6)^4 -1] = (0.482253 - 1) = -0.517747.

Multiply by f = 0.1: 0.1 * (-0.517747) ≈ -0.0517747.

So the fractional change is approximately -5.177% when the spots are visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.18%.

Now, the exoplanet would cause the same amplitude when it transits. The amplitude is (Rp/Rs)^2, because the area blocked is (Rp/Rs)^2 of the star's disk.

So (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.0517747 → Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2276, or about 22.76% of the star's radius.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A: ~0.39, D: ~0.32, C: ~0.11, B: ~0.07.

Hmm, 0.2276 isn't an option. So maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the effect on the brightness when the spots are on the far side of the star, but that doesn't make sense because the spots are on one hemisphere. Oh wait, as the star rotates, the spots come into view, then go out of view as the star completes a rotation. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, and the brightness returns to normal when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. The star's brightness varies due to the spots as it rotates. But the question is to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the maximum change in flux when the spots are on the same side as the observer. But I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the star's brightness variation as the difference between the unspotted and spotted areas. So the maximum decrease is the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

So the maximum dip is:

dF = F_spots - F_normal.

Wait, no, because when the spots are visible, the total flux is F = F_normal * (1 - f) + F_spot * f.

So the maximum dip is F0 - F = F0 - [F0 (1 - f) + f F_spot ] = F0 f (1 - (F_spot / F0 )).

F_spot is sigma (5000)^4, F0 is sigma (6000)^4.

So (F_spot / F0 ) = (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So F0 - F = F0 * f (1 - 0.4823) = F0 * f * 0.5177.

So the dip is F0 * 0.1 * 0.5177 = F0 * 0.05177, which is about 5.177% of F0, which matches what I calculated earlier.

So the dip is about 5.18% of the star's flux when the spots are visible.

So for the planet, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2, which must equal 0.05177.

So R_p = R_s * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ R_s * 0.2276 ≈ 22.8% of R_s.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the spot coverage is on only one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible at any given time. Wait, no, because the question states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.1 fraction of the star's surface is covered.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's think again: the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible. So the fraction of the star's disk covered is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Wait, the hemisphere's area is half the star's surface, which is 2 pi R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². The total surface area is 4 pi R², so the fraction f is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1.

So f is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the fraction of the stellar surface covered and the fraction of the disk area covered when viewed from Earth. But in this case, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.1 fraction is visible. So the calculation is correct.

But the options don't have 0.2276, which is about 0.23.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness variation due to the spots as being the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are not visible (maximum brightness) and when the spots are fully visible (minimum brightness). So the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, but in reality, for a transiting planet, the amplitude is the dip during transit, which is just the (Rp/Rs)^2. So perhaps in this situation, the dip due to the spots is 5.18%, and the planet's dip is 5.18%.

So the planet's radius would be about 22.76% of the star's radius, which is about 0.2276 R_s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: the light curve variation due to spots is a sinusoidal variation with an amplitude related to the spotted area and the temperature difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius that would cause the same amplitude as the star's brightness variation, not the same dip. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem as the change in brightness caused by the spots being the same as the change caused by the planet. So the amplitude is the same.

The star's brightness variation is about 5.18% as we calculated. The planet's effect is (Rp/Rs)^2. So setting (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot's effect calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the difference between the normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are visible. So the amplitude is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = 0.0518, which is 5.18% as before.

So the planet's effect is the same, so (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the spot effect.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the spots are cooler, but the star's overall flux is the sum of the normal and spot areas. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are expecting a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation due to rotational modulation, which may involve more complex factors like the spot distribution and viewing angle. But I think that's beyond the scope of the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude determined by the spot coverage, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the area blocked by the spots as a function of rotation. For example, when the star's rotation brings the spots into view, the blocked area varies sinusoidally. But perhaps for the maximum dip, it's when the entire spot is visible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the spots to be on the equator, so as the star rotates, the spots sweep across the viewable area. But I think that doesn't change the maximum dip, which is when the entire spot area is visible.

Hmm. Since none of the options match 0.2276, perhaps I made an error in the spot fraction.

Wait, another possibility: the problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So their temperature is 5000K.

But wait, is the spot temperature 6000K - 1000K = 5000K? Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the calculation should use the ratio of the flux from the spots to the total flux of the star. So the fractional change in flux is:

delta_F = [ (sigma (5000)^4) * (0.1 * 4 pi R^2) ] / [ sigma (6000)^4 * 4 pi R^2 ) ]

Wait, no. Because the flux is the sum of the normal and spotted areas.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2.

With spots, the total flux is F = sigma R^2 [ (4 pi R^2 - 0.1 *4 pi R^2) Teff^4 + 0.1 *4 pi R^2 (5000)^4 ] / (4 pi R^2) )? No, perhaps that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

So F = (1 - f) * Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi) ) + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi) )

Which simplifies to F = R^2 sigma [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ].

So the fractional change is [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1 = [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 ] -1.

Which is what I had before, so it's correct.

So back to the planet's radius. The planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rs)^2. So we have (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.2276, which is about 0.23.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet to cause the same amplitude as the star's brightness variation, but the star's variation is not just the dip but the peak-to-peak variation. Wait, but the star's brightness varies from F0 to F_min, so the peak-to-peak would be F0 - F_min. But when the spots are not visible, the brightness is F0, and when they are, it's F_min. So the amplitude is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = 5.18%, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's variation is a sine-like curve, so the amplitude is half the peak-to-peak variation. No, in this case, the brightness goes from F0 to F_min, so the amplitude is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = 5.18% as before.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But the options are there, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the brightness variation is not just the dip when the spots are visible, but also a rise when the other hemisphere (which is unspotted) comes into view. Wait, but the star's other hemisphere is normal, so the brightness would rise back to F0 when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible. So the maximum brightness variation would be F0 (no spots) and F_min (spots fully visible). So the amplitude is (F0 - F_min)/F0 = 5.18%.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to both the spots and the unspotted regions as it rotates. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the product of the spot coverage and the temperature difference, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the change in flux as a function of time, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a function of the spot's coverage and the rotational period, but that's not relevant for the amplitude calculation.

Wait, another approach: the effective temperature of the star includes the contribution from both the normal and spotted regions. So perhaps the star's overall effective temperature is different when the spots are present, but that's not relevant for the brightness variation as observed in time-series photometry.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot's area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of half the star's surface. So the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2, which is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, as before.

So the calculation seems correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to model the brightness variation as when the spots are on the far side and the near side, leading to a different calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot coverage as a fraction of the observed disk, not the entire surface.

Wait, perhaps the actual area of the spots as seen from Earth is not the same as the area on the star's surface. But when the spot is on the limb, the apparent area is smaller due to foreshortening. Wait, but for simplicity, I think the problem assumes that the entire spot is visible when the hemisphere is facing us, so the area fraction is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and the planet's radius is to be found relative to the Sun's radius, but that's not the case; the planet's radius is relative to the host star, which is the same as the Sun's.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

I calculated 0.2276, which is ~0.23. None of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are cooler, so the flux from them is less, but the star's total flux when spots are present is the sum of the normal and spot fluxes. So when the star is not spotty, its flux is F0. When spotty, it's F = F0 - f (F0 - F_spot), where F_spot is the flux from the spot area.

Hmm, but I think I modeled that correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's observed flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions, each of which emits with their respective temperatures.

So the total flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

F0 = sigma Teff^4.

F_spot = sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4.

So the fractional change is F = (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4.

So delta_F = F - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 ] - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)/Teff )^4 - 1 ].

Which again leads to delta_F/F0 = [ (1 - f) + f ( (5000/6000)^4 ) -1 ] = -f + f (0.4823) )= f ( -0.5177 ).

So same result as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the filling factor. The problem states that the hemisphere is covered with dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. The star's total area is 4 pi R^2. So f = 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1.

So that's correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are only visible when the hemisphere is facing us, and when it's not, the star's flux is F0. So the brightness variation is from F0 to F0 + (F_spot - F0)*f.

Wait, no. When the spots are not visible, the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot. So the variation is F - F0 = f (F_spot - F0).

Which is negative, as F_spot < F0.

So the amplitude is |F - F0| / F0 = | f (F_spot - F0) | / F0 = f (F0 - F_spot)/F0.

F_spot = sigma (5000)^4, F0 = sigma (6000)^4.

So (F0 - F_spot)/F0 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So the amplitude is f * 0.5177 = 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, or 5.177%.

So the planet's effect is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2276.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's radius to be the same as the Sun's, but perhaps the Sun's radius is being considered differently. Oh, no, the problem states the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so R_s is R_sun.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the spots are causing a variation in brightness that's a combination of the spot coverage and the temperature difference. So perhaps the overall variation is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the planet's radius calculated as sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4)).

Wait, sqrt(0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4)) = sqrt(0.1 * (1 - 0.4823)) = sqrt(0.1 * 0.5177) ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276, same as before.

Hmm.

Well, given the options, perhaps the closest option to 0.2276 is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius such that the semi-amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the star's. The semi-amplitude would be half the peak-to-peak variation, but in this case, the peak-to-peak is 5.177%, so semi-amplitude is 2.5885%, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the variation in terms of the ratio of the areas. But I think I've covered that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation includes both the spots and the unspotted regions, but I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck. The calculation I've done leads me to Rp/Rs ≈ 0.2276, which is about 0.23, but that's not an option. The closest option is D) ~0.32, which is about 32%, which is higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot's filling factor. Let me recheck.

Problem states: one hemisphere covered with dark spots, filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 (filling factor) × area of hemisphere.

Hemisphere area = 2 pi R².

So spots area = 0.2 × 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

Star's total surface area = 4 pi R².

So f = 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are on the far side and the near side. So the maximum variation would be twice the dip, but that doesn't make sense because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0, and when they're on the near side, it's F_min. So the amplitude is F0 - F_min, which is 5.177%.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the planet's radius as sqrt(f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4)).

Wait, that's what I did, leading to 0.2276.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the planet's effect is a transit, which is a dip of (Rp/Rs)^2. So the star's dip is 5.177%, soRp/Rs is sqrt(0.05177) = ~0.2276.

Hmm.

Perhaps the options have a typo, but given the options, the closest is not present. So perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with the star's flux without spots being the sum of all areas, including spots. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots to cover 20% of the star's entire surface, not just one hemisphere. So f = 0.2, not 0.1. Would that change the calculation?

If f were 0.2, then deltaF/F0 = 0.2 * ( (5/6)^4 -1 ) = 0.2 * (-0.5177) = -0.1035, so a 10.35% dip.

Then the planet's (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

Ah! So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the filling factor. The problem states that one hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. Perhaps the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 20% filled with spots, the area is 0.2 × 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R², and f = 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1.

But if the problem had intended that the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface, then f=0.2, leading to a dip of 10.35%, and Rp/Rs ≈ 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the mistake was in interpreting the filling factor. The problem says the hemisphere is covered with dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star.

But perhaps the intended interpretation is that the total area covered by spots on the entire star is 20% of the star's surface. So f=0.2.

If that's the case, then f=0.2.

So let's re-calculate:

deltaF/F0 = f [ ( (5/6)^4 -1 ) ] = 0.2 * (-0.5177) = -0.1035 → 10.35% dip.

So planet's (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

So perhaps that's the intended approach. So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When spots are visible, the total flux is reduced due to the cooler spots:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = F_0 \cdot [(1 - f) + f \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4]
     \]
     where \( f \) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

3. **Filling Factor and Fraction of Spots**:
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere. The surface area of one hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area covered by spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \cdot 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2
     \]
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1
     \]

4. **Fractional Change in Flux**:
   - Substituting \( f = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) into the flux equation:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \cdot \left[\left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 - 1\right]
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \cdot \left[\left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 - 1\right]
     \]
   - Compute \( \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \cdot (0.4823 - 1) = 0.1 \cdot (-0.5177) \approx -0.05177
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is approximately \( -5.18\% \).

5. **Exoplanet Radius for the Same Amplitude**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the area it blocks:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \left|\frac{\Delta F}{F_0}\right| = 0.05177
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2276
     \]

6. **Revisiting the Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor \( f \) were interpreted as 20% of the **entire star's surface** (not just one hemisphere), then \( f = 0.2 \). Recomputing:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \cdot (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 \cdot (-0.5177) \approx -0.1035
     \]
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035 \implies \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]
   - This matches **option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. Under this interpretation, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
