Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, it's typically an E2 elimination reaction. So, I'm thinking that the product here would be a diene, since eliminating two bromides would form a double bond. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the rings are pretty rigid. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe another structure, but likely some conjugated diene.

The product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. Wait, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, if we're eliminating to form a diene, where's the carbonyl coming from? Oh, wait. Maybe I got the reaction wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in some cases, elimination can form an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Or, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with KOH, more likely elimination.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a diene but an epoxide. Wait, but how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Epoxides are usually formed from vicinal dihalides. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal; it's across a ring. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 probably indicates a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How does that happen? Oh, wait, another possibility is that the dibromide undergoes a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require a specific mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromines, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but for that, you'd need elimination with the formation of a double bond and then perhaps a keto-enol type tautomerism? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, and if the bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that can form a bridge when eliminated, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base, could eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think: elimination of two HBr molecules from adjacent carbons could form a double bond, but how would that turn into a carbonyl? Oh! Wait, maybe the compound is undergoing a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a conjugated diene. But then where does the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, not elimination. But KOH is a strong base, so substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. However, substitution in such a rigid structure would probably form a diol. Oh, but that would have OH groups, which would show up in IR as O-H stretches, which they probably don't mention. The IR given is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl, so substitution is probably not the case.

Hmm, maybe the product is a diketone? But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr's to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis leading to a ketone. Wait, maybe the base is causing the compound to eliminate and form a carbonyl via an enolate mechanism. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the product's NMR. The 1H NMR of product 1 is given as: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a -CH2- group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an ether or a carbonyl. Wait, 4.79 is a bit upfield for an ether, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene next to an oxygen, like an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide protons usually resonate around 3.5-4.5 ppm. But in this case, the 4.79 could be an epoxide. But earlier confusion about the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, if the product has a carbonyl (from IR), perhaps it's a ketone. So if it's a ketone, the 4.79 could be something else. Maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but wait, that would be an ether.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a -CH2-O- group, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structures. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the product must have a similar framework but with functional groups.

Wait, another thought: when dibromides are treated with a strong base, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But if the base is in excess and heated, maybe a di-elimination occurs to form a conjugated diene. But in that case, the product would have a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the product. Maybe the product is an epoxide. Let's think: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a double elimination, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen bridge. But that would require vicinal dihalide, which 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't. Because 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So I don't think that's possible. So, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide. But that doesn't fit with the IR.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alkyne. But 1720 cm^-1 is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. So perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, maybe each Br is adjacent to a CH2 group, and upon elimination, each CH2Br becomes CH, but that's not possible. Alternatively, let's imagine that the structure is such that eliminating HBr from each Br leads to a conjugated diene. But that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene, but then treated under some conditions to form a ketone. Oh, but the first step is KOH and heat, which is more likely elimination than anything else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a strained ring ketone. Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane leads to the formation of a bicyclic ketone upon elimination. Because in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are where the Brs are. So eliminating Br from each bridgehead might form a bridge with a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps that's what's happening.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When treated with KOH, each Br is eliminated, and each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, but that would require dehydrohalogenation, which would form a diene. But in a rigid structure like adamantane, forming a diene might lead to a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond and the loss of HBr, but perhaps in a way that forms a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via a keto-enol tautomer. That seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the diepoxide. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. For that, each Br would have to be replaced by a carbonyl, but that would require two oxidations. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether with a carbonyl group. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Oh, wait, diols would show broad O-H signals in IR, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a ring-opening. Let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, leading to a ketone.

Wait, another idea: perhaps it's a double elimination, leading to a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but then in the IR, the 1720 cm^-1 is a mistake. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the NMR data: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 is a singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Let's say it's an OCH₂ group. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) are probably the adamantane ring protons, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, perhaps it's 1,3-diketone. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a epoxide, but then the IR would show an epoxide's C-O-C stretch, which is around 1250-1050 cm^-1. But the IR here is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, here's another thought: Maybe KOH is causing a ring-opening of adamantane, forming a more open structure with a carbonyl. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a diene, and in the second step, something else happens.

Wait, perhaps I should move to the next step and see.

The second step: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a diene, perhaps it undergoes a reaction like dienolysis or some cycloaddition. Alternatively, if product 1 is a dienol, maybe it's forming a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid could undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, without knowing product 1, it's hard to say, but let's think.

The third step: Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into a dialdehyde or diketone, depending on substitution.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

So, if product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but what was product 2? It was formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 was a ketone, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted compound, maybe a dienone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is the diene, product 2 is a dienol ether, which upon ozonolysis would give specific fragments.

Wait, let me try to retrace.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR shows 1720 cm^-1, which is probably a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. How?

Perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, which forms a conjugated diene. But how does that give a ketone? Maybe I'm missing something about the structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon treatment with KOH leads to a diene, but maybe that diene isn't stable and then undergoes further oxidation. But KOH isn't oxidizing, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl. Because cyclopropane rings can sometimes form from adjacent dihalides.

Wait, cyclopropanation. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, eliminating two HBr molecules would form a cyclopropane ring. But 1 and 3 are not adjacent in adamantane. Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is part of three rings.

Wait, maybe the two Br are on adjacent bridgeheads, allowing elimination to form a bridge with a double bond or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group. So, product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, like adamantane-1,3-dione.

If that's the case, then the NMR would make sense. Let's think about the NMR data:

4.79 ppm (2H, singlet) – perhaps a methylene group attached to an oxygen, but since IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2. Wait, but a ketone has carbonyl adjacent to R groups, not necessarily a CH2 next to O.

Alternatively, the 4.79 could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. But if the product is a ketone, where does that O come from?

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group. For example, cyclopropane rings can be strained, and the ring-opening under basic conditions might form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dienone, a conjugated diene with a ketone.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. So, a bicyclic ketone. If that's the case, then the NMR would show specific signals. The 4.79 ppm is a bit high for a regular CH2 group, but perhaps it's part of the ring structure. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead protons and other ring protons, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another set of equivalent protons.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, the next step is treating with Al isopropoxide. AlCl3 is often used in Friedel-Crafts, but Al isopropoxide is a milder Lewis acid. Perhaps it's used for acylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, what would happen when treated with Al isopropoxide? Maybe it would undergo some kind of enolate formation or undergo a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could undergo some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming a more substituted double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and then product 2 is a more substituted diene.

But without the exact structure, this is tricky.

The third step is ozonolysis of product 2 to give product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl. Such protons are typically in CH₂ groups next to carbonyls, giving them a triplet (if adjacent to another CH₂) or a quartet, etc., depending on neighboring protons.

In ozonolysis, if the diene is symmetric, the resulting carbonyl groups would be in a certain coupling environment.

Wait, in ozonolysis of a diene, each end becomes a carbonyl. For example, if the diene is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But in the case of a more complex structure, like a bicyclic diene, the ozonolysis could give ketones or other carbonyls.

The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So in product 3, perhaps there are two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH₂ group. The protons on these CH₂ groups would couple with neighboring protons.

If each CH₂ is adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons might be in a triplet or quartet, depending on coupling.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Let's imagine that product 3 has two carbonyl groups, each next to a CH₂ group. Each CH₂ would have two protons. How would these protons couple?

In a typical case, each CH₂ next to a carbonyl would be split by neighboring protons. If each CH₂ is next to another CH₂, perhaps there's coupling between them.

Wait, let's say in product 3, we have a structure like O=C-R-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. Wait, but that's a linear structure. Alternatively, if the ozonolysis breaks a conjugated diene into two carbonyls, perhaps each with a CH₂ group attached.

But perhaps the actual structure is more like two carbonyls connected in a ring, each adjacent to a CH₂.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, this is tough.

Alternatively, think about the coupling patterns. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

A triplet would come from coupling with two equivalent neighboring protons. A triplet of triplets would have two different coupling constants. A doublet of triplets would have a triplet from one coupling and a doublet from another. A pentet would be a quartet from one coupling and another split.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded proton is likely near an electronegative group, so it's probably a vinylic or allylic proton. Or, as mentioned before, a CH₂ next to a carbonyl.

If the proton is on a CH₂ next to a carbonyl and is adjacent to another CH₂ group, which in turn is next to another set of CH₂, then the coupling could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, the protons would split into quartets, but that's not an option.

Wait, another scenario: if the proton is on a CH₂ group that's next to a CH group, which is next to another CH₂. The coupling could be a triplet from the adjacent CH₂ and a doublet from the CH, leading to a triplet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is adjacent to two different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants, it might lead to a more complex splitting.

Wait, here's another idea. Suppose product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, and each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group and a CH group.

For example, if the structure is like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, but that's a straight chain. The middle CH₂ would be between two other CH₂ groups.

Wait, but the coupling in that case would be a quartet (each proton on CH₂ sees two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH₂), but that's a quartet, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ring, such as a cyclopropane or cyclobutane with ketone groups.

Wait, perhaps when product 2 is a bicyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each connected to a bridgehead.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone adjacent to a CH₂ group. Each CH₂ group would be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, if the structure is O=C-R-CH₂-C=O, with R being some group, then the CH₂ protons would couple with any adjacent protons.

If R is a single carbon, like CH₂-C(=O), then the CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂, leading to a quartet. But the options don't have a quartet.

Alternatively, if R is a CH group, then the CH₂ protons would couple with the CH protons. If the CH has one proton, each CH₂ proton would be a doublet. But if the CH is split by the CH₂, it could lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps each CH₂ in product 3 is coupled with two different sets of protons. For example, each CH₂ is next to a CH (which is a doublet) and another CH₂ (which is a triplet). So the splitting would be a combination, leading to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to think of a specific example.

Suppose product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, and each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ and a CH.

So for each CH₂, the coupling would be:

- Coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ (which would be a triplet, since each H in CH₂ is split into a triplet by two others).
- Also, coupling with the CH group, which has one proton, leading to a doublet.

So the overall splitting would be a triplet (from adjacent CH₂) and a doublet (from CH), making a triplet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to two different CH₂ groups, each with different coupling constants, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another approach: The most deshielded proton is likely to be the one closest to the carbonyl, perhaps on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. If that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group and another CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH₂, the coupling would involve multiple J values.

For example, each proton on the CH₂ would be:

- Coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ (J1), leading to a triplet.
- Coupled with the one proton on the adjacent CH (J2), leading to a doublet.

So the overall pattern would be a triplet (from J1) split by each of the two protons on the CH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, each proton on CH₂ would have coupling with the two protons on one adjacent CH₂ (triplet) and the one proton on the CH (doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, maybe the CH₂ is coupled with two different sets of protons, each triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, if each H on the CH₂ is split by two adjacent CH₂ groups, each with a triplet coupling, the result would be a triplet of triplets. That could fit option B or C.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH group that's adjacent to two CH₂ groups. Each of those CH₂ groups would have two protons, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, let me think about it.

Suppose the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH(O) - something.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like O=C-CH2-CH-CH2-C=O, arranged in a ring or chain.

In such a case, the CH group would have two adjacent CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ has two protons. So each H on the CH would be coupled with two protons from each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet from one side and another triplet from the other. But since each coupling would be with two different sets, the overall pattern might be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH is between two CH₂ groups, each with two protons, the CH's proton would be split into a triplet from each adjacent CH₂. So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH₂ group that is adjacent to another CH₂ group and also a CH group. So each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH₂ (triplet) and the one H on the CH (doublet). So the overall pattern would be a triplet (from the adjacent CH₂) each split by the CH proton, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is adjacent to a CH group and another CH₂ group, each with different coupling constants, the splitting could be a doublet of triplets (if one coupling is larger than the other), which is option C.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures again.

Product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is perhaps a more substituted ketone or an enol ether.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would break into carbonyls.

Suppose product 2 is a diene, maybe a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would typically produce two carbonyls connected by a chain.

For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. But product 3 would have two aldehyde protons, which are usually around 9-10 ppm in NMR, but the question is about the most deshielded, which could be those protons.

But in the options, we're looking for the coupling pattern, not the shift.

Aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and show up as a singlet (since they're usually not coupled to any other protons, unless adjacent to another group). But if the aldehyde is part of a larger structure, perhaps it's coupled.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't an aldehyde but a ketone.

Alternatively, product 3 could have a structure where the most deshielded proton is part of a CH₂ group next to two different sets of protons.

Another angle: the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 isn't an aromatic compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, which converts a ketene into a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or a more substituted ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated enone.

Then, ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is an enone, like a cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

In such a case, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

If the product is a diketone, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have specific coupling.

For example, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then each CH₂ is next to another CH₂. Each proton on the CH₂ would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a quartet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2 would have two adjacent CH2 groups, each with two protons. Each proton would be a triplet from each adjacent CH2, but that's a quartet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons, the coupling would be a quartet (from each adjacent CH2), but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group and another CH2, the coupling could be a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH), leading to a triplet of doublets. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups. Each CH would have one proton, so each H on CH2 would be a doublet from each adjacent CH. That would lead to a doublet of doublets, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the structure leads to each CH2 being split by two different coupling constants, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to one CH with one proton and another CH2 with two protons. So each H on the CH2 would have coupling with the CH (doublet) and the CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are such that it's a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm still not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH group, which is adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two protons, leading to two triplets. So the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, option B.

Wait, another way: if the proton is coupled to two different sets of two protons (each with J1 and J2), the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene. However, the IR spectrum of the product (1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the product is not a simple diene but likely a bicyclic ketone, such as adamantane-1,3-dione. The NMR data supports this: the 4.79 ppm singlet (2H) could correspond to a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, while the 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H) signals correspond to the adamantane ring protons.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**: Product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces further structural changes, potentially forming a more substituted carbonyl compound or an enol ether. However, the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds or conjugated systems, forming carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a conjugated diene or enone, ozonolysis would break the π-bond, resulting in a diketone or dialdehyde.

4. **NMR of Product 3**: The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded proton is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If the structure of product 3 is a diketone, the protons on the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. These protons would couple with neighboring protons, leading to splitting patterns.

   - If the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group and a CH group, the coupling would result in a triplet of triplets due to interactions with protons from both adjacent groups.
   - This matches the description of option B, which corresponds to a triplet of triplets.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

**Answer: B**
