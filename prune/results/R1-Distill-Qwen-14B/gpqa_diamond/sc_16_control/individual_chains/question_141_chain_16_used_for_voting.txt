Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait a second, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, I think that's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 'd' doesn't make sense here. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Wait, but the formula is given as 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps 'd' stands for something else. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, right. But I'm not entirely sure. But I'll proceed with that assumption.

So, the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine on carbon 1, and methyl groups on carbons 2 and 4. Wait, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me draw it out. Carbon 1 has Br, carbon 2 has a methyl, and carbon 4 has a methyl. So, numbering the benzene, 1 has Br, 2 is next to it with CH3, and 4 is across from 1? Wait, no, because in benzene, position 1, 2, and 4 are not all adjacent. Let's see: positions 1, 2, and 4 would be in a sort of triangle. So, the substituents are at 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3).

Wait, but that's an interesting structure. So, when we treat this with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. Oh, right! NaNH2 is a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for eliminating HX (like HBr) to form alkenes. But wait, since this is benzene with substituents, it's about aromatic substitution.

Wait, but benzene doesn't undergo elimination. Wait, maybe the situation is different. Oh wait, wait a minute, benzene is aromatic, so elimination reactions would apply to substituents that can form double bonds. But in this case, the substituents are methyl groups and a bromine.

Wait, but wait, maybe this is a bromobenzene derivative, and the reaction is a substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Alternatively, it's used in elimination reactions. Wait, but in aromatic systems, elimination (like forming a double bond) would require adjacent leaving groups or H's.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base. Wait, another thought: when aromatic rings have strong activating groups, like amino groups, they can undergo substitution under certain conditions. But bromine is a deactivating group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: in the Birch reduction, NaNH2 is used, but that's for reducing aromatic rings. But I don't think that's the case here because the presence of methyl groups and Br might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is for dehydrohalogenation, but that would require an adjacent H to the Br.

Wait, wait! 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the Br is on position 1, and methyl groups are on 2 and 4. So, in this structure, the Br is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to two methyl groups. Now, if we're treating this with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it's causing an elimination reaction. But in aromatic substitution, that doesn't directly make sense. Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 is acting as a base for an aromatic ring substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again about the reaction. Oh, wait! The solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a liquid at low temperatures. So, perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but in an aromatic compound. But how?

Wait, maybe it's more about elimination. So, if there's a Br attached to a carbon adjacent to a methyl group, an E2 elimination can occur, removing H and Br to form a double bond. So, in this case, the Br is on C-1, and the adjacent C-2 has a methyl group. Wait, but the methyl groups are on C-2 and C-4. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the Br is on C-1 and the methyl groups are on C-2 and C-4. So, the adjacent carbons to C-1 would be C-2 and C-6.

Wait, so C-1 has Br, C-2 has CH3, and C-4 has CH3. So, the Br is on C-1, and the adjacent carbons (C-2 and C-6) have methyl and hydrogen, respectively. So, in this case, the Br is attached to C-1, and the adjacent C-2 has a CH3 group. So, perhaps the base (NH2-) can abstract a beta hydrogen from C-2, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond between C-1 and C-2. Wait, but that would require the H to be on C-2, which is attached to a CH3. So, the H's on C-2 are probably not available for elimination because the CH3 group is in the way. Or maybe they are? If the hydrogen is on the same carbon as the methyl group, but is it possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are in such positions that they block elimination. Wait, but let's think about the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). So, the Br is at position 1, and at position 2, a CH3 is attached. So, the adjacent carbons to C-1 (Br) are C-2 (CH3) and C-6. So, the H's on C-6 might be available for elimination. So, perhaps the base (NH2-) abstracts a hydrogen from C-6, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C-1 and C-6. Wait, but that's a six-membered ring; forming a double bond between C-1 and C-6 would make a benzene ring with a double bond? That doesn't make sense because benzene is already a conjugated ring with three double bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a typical nucleophile for aromatic substitution. Wait, but if the ring is activated, perhaps it can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution. However, bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring, making nucleophilic substitution difficult. Unless there are strong activating groups present. But in this case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are activating (they're electron-donating via the sigma bond). So, perhaps the ring is activated enough for substitution.

Wait, but NaNH2 is such a strong base that perhaps it's abstracting a proton and causing a ring expansion or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is being replaced by an amide group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solvent is ammonia, which can act as a nucleophile. So, in a substitution reaction, the NH2^- could replace the Br. But for nucleophilic aromatic substitution to occur, the ring needs to be activated. Since the ring has methyl groups, which are activating, and the Br is a deactivating group, but perhaps the activating groups are in positions that make the ring susceptible to substitution at the Br position.

Wait, in nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings, the substituents need to be strongly activating. Methyl is an activating group, but when the leaving group is in a position that's meta to activating groups, it's possible. For example, in 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl bromide, substitution is possible. But in our case, the substituents are at 1 (Br), 2, and 4.

Wait, the ring has methyl groups at 2 and 4, and Br at 1. So, for nucleophilic substitution, the Br is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, the ring would have activating groups at positions 2 and 4, and the leaving group at 1.

If the substituents are in positions that effectively activate the ring towards substitution at the Br position, then substitution could occur. Let me think about the directing effects. Methyl groups are ortho/para directors. So, the methyl at position 2 would direct incoming nucleophiles to positions 1 and 3 (ortho and para to it). The methyl at position 4 would direct to positions 3 and 5. So, the Br is at position 1, which is ortho to the methyl at position 2, and para to the methyl at position 4. Hmm, so perhaps the ring is activated enough at position 1 for nucleophilic substitution.

But wait, nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires that the leaving group is in a position where the ring is highly activated, like with strong activating groups (like -O- or -NH2) in positions that can stabilize the transition state through resonance. In this case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are weakly activating, so perhaps the ring isn't activated enough for substitution. Or maybe the presence of two methyl groups in positions that can stabilize the transition state would make substitution feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a substitution but an elimination. Let me consider that.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If the benzene ring has a Br and adjacent H's, perhaps elimination can occur. But in an aromatic ring, elimination would form a double bond, but the ring is already conjugated. Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, causing the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene already has conjugated double bonds, so forming another double bond would require breaking the existing ones, which isn't feasible. So, perhaps elimination isn't the right approach here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a demethylation or some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is used to deprotonate something, and then the Br leaves, leading to some kind of ring expansion or other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of aromatic ring substitution, where the Br is replaced by an amide group. So, the NH2- would attack the carbon where Br is attached, pushing the Br out as a leaving group. But as I mentioned earlier, the ring is already deactivating because of Br, but activating because of the methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups are in positions that activate the ring for substitution at the Br position. Let me think about the substituents: the methyl groups are at 2 and 4. The Br is at 1. So, the substituents are 2 and 4, which are ortho and para to each other. The Br is at 1, which is para to position 5 (but that's not substituted), and ortho to position 2 (which has the methyl). So, perhaps the methyl groups at 2 and 4 are both activating the position 1, making substitution feasible.

So, if substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene, or perhaps after some reaction, but wait, NaNH2 is in ammonia, which is a weak nucleophile. Wait, actually, NaNH2 is a strong base but a good nucleophile in certain cases. So, perhaps the NH2- can attack the electrophilic carbon where Br is attached.

But considering the directing effects, I'm a bit confused. Methyl groups are activating, so they direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions. So, the Br, which is at position 1, is ortho to position 2 (CH3) and para to position 4 (CH3). So, perhaps the ring is activated enough for substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps there's more than one product because there are multiple positions where substitution can occur if the ring is activated in certain ways. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is only at position 1 (Br), but the question is about the products when Br leaves.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about substitution but elimination. But I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond, but that seems impossible because benzene already has a conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion, but I can't think of a way for that to happen here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. If substitution occurs, replacing Br with NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But if elimination occurs, perhaps the product is a different structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the NaNH2 is causing a coupling reaction. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the solvent is ammonia, which is a good nucleophile. So, maybe the substitution occurs, replacing Br with NH2. But considering the structure, after substitution, the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But that's just one product. So, the answer would be 1, option B.

But wait, sometimes, when substitution occurs, if there are possible sites for attack, but in this case, the substituents fix the position for substitution. So, substitution at position 1 would be the only product. So, only one product.

But wait, wait! Let me think again. If the reaction is elimination, would there be more than one product? Because the ring structure might allow for different sites of elimination. Wait, but in this molecule, the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 (CH3) and 6. If elimination occurs from C-1 and C-2, but C-2 is already substituted with a methyl, which would make it difficult to eliminate. Alternatively, elimination could occur between C-1 and C-6, but C-6 is a CH (I think, since the other substituents are CH3 at 2 and 4).

Wait, so if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C-6, adjacent to C-1 (Br), leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a double bond between C-1 and C-6. But that would form a benzene ring with a double bond, which isn't possible because the ring is already aromatic. So, that's probably not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, leading to a single product. So, that would mean only one organic product, making the answer option B) 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again about the structure. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the reaction is substitution with NH2-, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a single product.

Alternatively, if something else happens, like if the base abstracts a proton and causes some rearrangement, but I don't see an obvious pathway for that.

So, putting it all together, the reaction would produce one product, so the correct answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base and can act as a nucleophile. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. 

Key considerations for the reaction:

1. **Substitution Reaction**: NaNH₂ can replace the bromine atom through nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are electron-donating, which activates the aromatic ring and makes substitution feasible at the position of the bromine atom. This would yield 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene as the product.

2. **Elimination Reaction**: Elimination typically requires adjacent hydrogens to the leaving group (bromine) to form a double bond. However, the methyl group at position 2 blocks elimination from position 1, and elimination from position 6 is unlikely due to the aromatic nature of the benzene ring. Thus, elimination is not a viable pathway.

3. **Number of Products**: Since the reaction proceeds via substitution and the substituents fix the position of substitution, only one product is formed. There are no alternative pathways or multiple substitution sites that would lead to additional products.

Therefore, the reaction produces a single organic product, 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene.
