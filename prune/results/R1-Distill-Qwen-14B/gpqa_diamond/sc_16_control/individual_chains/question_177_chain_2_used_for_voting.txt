Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits.

Let me read the question again. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But wait, mass—I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Oh, because they're asking about luminosity, which is more about size and temperature maybe? I think mass relates more to other factors like brightness in certain spectra or something, but maybe not directly here.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if one was hotter, the peak would be at a shorter wavelength. So T1 = T2.

Wait, that's important. So both stars have the same temperature. Now, the formula for luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since σ is a constant and 4π is too, the luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth power.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T part cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1 / R2)². Because R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.25 as the first choice. Let me check the options again. Oh, option A is ~2.25. But wait, the question says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity—wait, that's the Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength shifts. But wait, the question said that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (their peak wavelengths) are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But does that mean that the actual temperatures are the same, or did their velocities affect the observed wavelengths?

Wait, I'm getting confused. So, the peak emission from the star is at a certain wavelength, but if the star is moving towards or away from us, we observe a Doppler shift. So, the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity divided by the speed of light.

But the question says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, even though the stars have different velocities, when you account for the Doppler shift, their peak wavelengths are the same. So, the rest wavelengths (the actual emission peaks) are different. So for each star, their emitted peak wavelengths are different, but after Doppler shifting, they appear the same.

Wait, no, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So, that would imply that the rest wavelengths are different, because Star_1 and Star_2 have different radial velocities. So their rest wavelengths would be different, but due to Doppler shifting, when observed, they appear the same.

So, that complicates things. Because if their rest wavelengths are different, then their temperatures are different. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So, if their observed lambda_max is the same, but their rest lambda_max are different, we have to account for their velocities.

Hmm, so I need to figure out the actual temperatures of each star. Let's think about this.

Let me denote:

lambda_observed_1 = lambda_rest_1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c) / (1 - v1/c) ) )

Similarly,

lambda_observed_2 = lambda_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) ) )

But lambda_observed_1 = lambda_observed_2 = lambda_obs.

So,

lambda_rest_1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) ) = lambda_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But wait, v1 is 0 km/s for Star_1, so that term simplifies. v2 is 700 km/s.

So for Star_1, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + 0)/(1 - 0) ) = 1. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1 * 1 = lambda_rest_1.

For Star_2, v2 is +700 km/s (assuming it's moving away, because if it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest. Wait, no, wait: if a star is moving away, the light is redshifted, so observed wavelength is longer. If moving toward, blueshifted, shorter.

So in this case, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we need to know the direction. The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. It doesn't specify direction, but in astronomy, radial velocity is often given as a scalar, but sometimes with a sign. Let's assume that radial velocity is positive when moving away from us. So Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than the rest.

Wait, but the observed lambda for both stars is the same. So let me write that equation.

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs (since v1 is 0).

lambda_obs = lambda_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

So, lambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But, from Wien's law, lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T. So, lambda_rest_1 = b / T1, and lambda_rest_2 = b / T2.

So, lambda_rest_1 = b / T1 → T1 = b / lambda_rest_1.

Similarly, T2 = b / lambda_rest_2.

But lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs, so T1 = b / lambda_obs.

lambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / D, where D is the Doppler factor.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of temperatures.

Let me write:

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs.

lambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / D, where D is sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) )

Because:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest_2 * D → lambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs / D.

So,

T1 = b / lambda_rest_1 = b / lambda_obs.

T2 = b / lambda_rest_2 = b / (lambda_obs / D ) = (b * D) / lambda_obs.

So T2 = T1 * D.

Wait, because:

T2 = (b * D) / lambda_obs = D * (b / lambda_obs) ) = D * T1.

So T2 = T1 * D.

But D is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is 700 km/s.

We need to calculate D here. Let's compute v = 700 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s, which is 300,000 km/s.

v = 700 km/s → v/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So approximately, v/c is 0.002333.

Now, (1 + v/c) = 1.002333, (1 - v/c) = 0.997667.

So the ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ approximately 1.0047.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute numerator and denominator:

1.002333 divided by 0.997667.

Let me approximate:

Compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute using approximation:

(1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + 2a when a is small. Because for small a, (1+a) ≈1 +a and (1 -a) ≈1 -a. So the ratio is (1 + a)/(1 -a) ≈ 1 + 2a, for small a.

Here, a is v/c ≈ 0.002333.

So 2a is about 0.004666.

So, (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.004666.

So the square root of that is sqrt(1.004666) ≈ approximately 1.00233.

Wait, because (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x when x is small. So if sqrt(1.004666)=1 + x, then x is approximately 0.00233.

So D ≈ 1.00233.

So, T2 = T1 * D → T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So, the temperatures of the stars are T1 and approximately 1.00233 T1.

But wait, since Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, but the actual rest wavelength is shorter (because the observed is longer). So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), approximately when v << c. So the rest wavelength is shorter. And since lambda is inversely proportional to temperature (lambda = b/T), a shorter rest wavelength means higher temperature. So T2 > T1.

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of D ≈ 1.00233.

So, now we can compute the luminosities.

Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

We are to find L1 / L2.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (2.25) R2².

T2 = T1 * D ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So, T2^4 = (T1^4) * D^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (1 / D^4).

Wait, because (T1^4)/(T2^4) = 1/(D^4).

So 2.25 / (1.00233)^4.

Compute D = 1.00233.

D^4 ≈ (1.00233)^4.

Let me compute that. Since D is approximately 1.00233, we can use the approximation (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x², for small x.

x = 0.00233, n=4.

So, D^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.00233) + (4*3/2)*(0.00233)^2.

Compute each term:

4 * 0.00233 = 0.00932.

(4*3/2) = 6 → 6 * (0.00233)^2 = 6 * (0.0000054289) ≈ 0.00003257.

So total D^4 ≈ 1 + 0.00932 + 0.00003257 ≈ 1.00935257.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00935257 ≈ 2.23.

Wait, 2.25 divided by approximately 1.00935 is roughly what?

Compute 2.25 / 1.00935.

Let me compute it: 2.25 / 1.00935.

Approximately,

1.00935 ≈ 1 + 0.00935.

So 2.25 / 1.00935 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.00935 + (0.00935)^2 - ...) (using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x, if x is small).

So,

≈ 2.25 * (0.99065 + 0.000087) → approximately 2.25 * 0.990737 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

But wait, earlier I thought the initial approach would give 2.25, but that didn't account for the Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. So the correct approach is to factor in the Doppler effect, which adjusts the temperatures, leading to a slightly lower ratio of L1/L2.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with Star_1 having a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, indicating that their peak emission wavelengths, after accounting for Doppler shifts, are identical. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming the stars radiate as black bodies, the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) is to be determined.

The luminosity of a star is given by the formula \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the rest wavelengths of the stars must differ due to their radial velocities. Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = b / T \)), the rest wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. The Doppler shift for Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, introduces a redshift, making its rest wavelength shorter and its temperature higher compared to Star_1.

The Doppler factor \( D \) is calculated as:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), \( v/c \approx 0.002333 \). Substituting:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} \approx \sqrt{1.004666} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus, \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot D \), where \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

Given \( R_1 = 1.5 \cdot R_2 \), \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Substituting \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot D \), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \frac{1}{D^4}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{D^4}
\]

Using \( D \approx 1.00233 \), \( D^4 \) is computed as:

\[
D^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.00233 + \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} \cdot (0.00233)^2 \approx 1.00935
\]

Substituting:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.00935} \approx 2.23
\]

Therefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.
