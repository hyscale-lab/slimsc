Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water.

First, let's look at the details. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. 

But wait, wait, no, wait. Because when you dilute, you have to calculate the new concentration. So the initial moles of acetic acid would be volume in liters multiplied by molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

Then, when diluted with 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles over volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the problem says we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Because acetic acid is a monoprotic acid, so 1:1 ratio.

So the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles divided by concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is asking about 25% titration and the equivalence point. Hmm. So for 25% titration, that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³.

So at 25% titration, we're looking at a solution that's a buffer solution—some acetic acid and some acetate ions. Because we've added a quarter of the required NaOH.

So let's tackle the pH at 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.25 mmol. Wait, let's make sure about the units. 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles, which is 0.25 mmol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles, which is 1 mmol. So when we add 0.25 mmol of NaOH, it will react with 0.25 mmol of acetic acid, producing 0.25 mmol of acetate. So the moles of acetic acid left are 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 mmol, and the moles of acetate formed are 0.25 mmol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So the concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.75 mmol / 42.5 mL = 0.75 / 42.5 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[Acetate] = 0.25 mmol / 42.5 mL ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait—since the volumes are in mL, maybe I should keep them in mL to avoid confusion. So 42.5 mL is 42.5, so 0.75 /42.5 = 0.017647 M, yes.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me calculate pKa. 

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73. Wait, exact calculation: 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10^-5. So log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.73 (since 5 - 0.267 is about 4.733, which I'll round to 4.73).

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.73 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, A is 4.26, D is 4.57. Hmm. So 4.25 is close to option A's first value.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that ratio more accurately.

0.25 mmol of acetate, 0.75 mmol of acetic acid. So ratio is 1/3. Log(1/3) is about -0.4771. So pH=4.73 -0.4771=4.2529, which is about 4.25. So option A says 4.26, which is close.

Wait, but I'm getting 4.25, option A is 4.26. Maybe due to more precise calculations of pKa or the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial dilution calculation was incorrect. Let me double-check.

Wait, initial volume after dilution is 40 mL. So when we add 2.5 mL NaOH, total is 42.5 mL.

Wait, another approach: using moles, perhaps more accurately.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 20 mL *0.05 M=1 mmol. After dilution with 20 mL, concentration is 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH: moles NaOH=0.0025 L *0.1 = 0.00025 mol → 0.25 mmol.

So moles of CH3COOH = 1 mmol - 0.25 mmol = 0.75 mmol.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.25 mmol.

Total volume: 40 mL + 2.5 mL =42.5 mL → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.75 /42.5 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.25 /42.5 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647).

Wait, 0.005882/0.017647 is exactly 0.333333... So log(1/3) = -0.4771.

pKa is calculated more precisely. Ka is 1.85e-5.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → let me compute this accurately.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672.

So pKa = 4.7328. So pH=4.7328 -0.4771 =4.2557 ≈4.26. So that's option A's first value.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate will determine the pH. Let's find out.

Moles of acetate: 1 mmol (from the initial 1 mmol of acetic acid, all converted to acetate).

Total volume: initial 40 mL + 10 mL NaOH (equivalence point) →50 mL, which is 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 1 mmol /50 mL = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. Ka is1.85e-5, so Kb=1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.

Let x be [OH^-]. Then:

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 → since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈1.04e-5. pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so 5 -0.017=4.983 → pOH≈4.983.

pH =14 -4.983≈9.017.

Wait, but none of the options seem to have a pH around 9. Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, so none of the equivalence points are above 8.5. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 1 mmol. So at equivalence point, moles of acetate are 1 mmol, yes.

Volume is 50 mL (40 mL +10 mL) → 0.05 L. So [Acetate] = 0.02 M. Correct.

Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 5.405e-10. Yes.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], so:

x² / (0.02 -x ) ≈ x²/0.02 =5.405e-10 → x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]≈1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983 → pH=14-4.983=9.017.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial moles?

Wait, initial solution after dilution: 0.025 M acetic acid, 40 mL.

So moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol → 1 mmol. Correct.

At equivalence point, all converted to acetate. So 1 mmol in 50 mL → 0.02 M.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is not just acetate. Maybe I forgot the sodium ions? No, sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH.

Hmm. So according to my calculation, the pH should be around 9.02, but none of the options match that. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that all the NaOH is added at equivalence point. No, that's correct because 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is 1 mmol, which neutralizes the 1 mmol of acetic acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution hasn't been accounted for the activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb?

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw/Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 → approx 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression instead of approximating.

Let me try solving without approximation.

The expression is:

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. But if we check, x is 1e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So no, the calculation seems correct. So why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution step. Let me recheck that.

Initial volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 20 mL *0.05 M =1 mmol.

After adding 20 mL water, volume is 40 mL, so concentration is 1 mmol /40 mL =0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M acetate in 50 mL. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you dilute the solution, the concentration changes, but the question is about the equivalence point. Wait no, because all the moles are accounted for.

Hmm, maybe I should reevaluate the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the solution at equivalence point is not just acetate. Wait, the sodium comes from NaOH, which is a strong base, but sodium ions are spectator ions. So the pH is determined by acetate.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using the formula for weak base pH.

The formula is:

pH = (pKb + log C) / 2, but wait, no, that's for a weak acid or base in solution.

Alternatively, the pH can be found using the formula:

OH- concentration = sqrt(Kb * C)

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 M.

So pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.983 → pH=9.017.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 moles. Correct.

After adding 20 mL water, volume becomes 40 mL, concentration 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M.

Adding 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH: moles NaOH is 0.1 *0.01 =0.001. So exactly neutralizes the acetic acid. So the moles of acetate are 0.001.

Volume is 40 +10 =50 mL →0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, but perhaps the Ka was used instead of Kb? No, because for the equivalence point, we're dealing with a base (acetate), so Kb is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution is a buffer? No, at equivalence point, it's all acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact method without approximation.

Let's write Kb =5.405e-10.

The equation is:

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) =sqrt(1.081e-11) =1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is pH 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, maybe I messed up the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is acetate, but perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, maybe the solution is not acetate but another species.

Wait, perhaps in the equivalence point, the solution is not just acetate, but also excess NaOH? No, because at equivalence point, the moles of NaOH are exactly equal to the moles of acetic acid, so no excess.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps I didn't account for the dilution correctly when calculating the acetate concentration.

Wait, when you have 1 mmol acetate in 50 mL, that is indeed 0.02 M. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the error is in the calculation of Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa =4.73 (as before).

Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So I think the pH at equivalence point should be around 9.02. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the dilution step is where I went wrong. Let me recheck the initial dilution.

The initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles =0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol.

Then, we add 20 mL of water. So total volume is 40 mL. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but when titrating, the volume of the solution is 40 mL, and when adding NaOH, we add 25% of the volume needed for equivalence. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So the total volume at 25% is 40+2.5=42.5 mL.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the concentrations considering the mixing.

Wait, another thought: when the solution is diluted, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M, but perhaps I should consider the dissociation of acetic acid in the diluted solution before any NaOH is added.

Wait, but at 25% titration, we're dealing with a buffer solution, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach should still hold. So the initial pH before any NaOH is added might not be necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the volume is in L instead of mL. Wait no, because when I calculated moles, I used liters correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

The equation is x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me set up the equation:

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02. But no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate.

Wait, at equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps I should account for the fact that it's sodium acetate, which can hydrolyze.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the Kb expression properly.

Wait, another approach: The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + pKw + log (base/acid)

Wait, no, that's not a standard formula I recall. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base.

The formula is:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C)

But that's an approximation.

Wait, let me calculate [OH^-] precisely.

Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02.

So x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10 → x²= (5.405e-10)(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) → as before.

But perhaps I should consider x not being negligible. Let's solve the equation without approximation.

x^2 =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x^2 +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 → (2.920e-19) +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

Square root of D is sqrt(4.324e-11)= about 6.58e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.58e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root, so:

x=( -5.405e-10 +6.58e-6 ) /2 → (6.579e-6)/2=3.289e-6.

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Wait, but that would mean [OH^-]=3.289e-6 M. So pOH=5.485 → pH=14-5.485=8.515.

Ah, so pH≈8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, wait! So why did the previous approach give a different result?

Because when I neglected x in the denominator, I assumed x is negligible compared to 0.02, which is valid when x is small. But perhaps in this case, x isn't negligible enough, so the approximation isn't accurate.

Wait, let me compute the value with and without approximation.

With approximation: x≈1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Without approximation: x=3.289e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

So which one is correct?

The more accurate result comes from solving the quadratic equation, which gives x=3.289e-6 M. So [OH-]=3.289e-6 → pOH≈5.48 → pH≈8.52.

So that matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, but why did the initial approximation give a different result? Because when x is not negligible compared to C=0.02, the approximation breaks down.

Wait, in this case, x is 3.289e-6, and C is 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So 3e-6 is much smaller than 2e-2, so the approximation should still hold. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, let me recheck the quadratic approach.

Equation: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b + sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.920e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approximately 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.324e-11).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.577e-6.

So x=( -5.405e-10 +6.577e-6 ) /2 → (6.577e-6 -5.405e-10 )/2 → ≈3.289e-6.

So [OH-]=3.289e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Hmm, that's correct. So perhaps the initial approximation was not accurate enough, and the more precise calculation gives pH=8.52.

So putting it together: at 25% titration, pH≈4.26; at equivalence point, pH≈8.52. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **1. Initial Setup and Dilution**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Volume (L)} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \).  
  The new concentration of acetic acid is:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **2. Titration at 25%**
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires \( 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated below), so 25% titration corresponds to \( 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of NaOH added.

- **Moles of NaOH added at 25% titration:**  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Volume (L)} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Reaction with acetic acid:**  
  NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. After adding \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of NaOH:  
  - Remaining moles of CH₃COOH:  
    \[
    0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
    \]
  - Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:  
    \[
    0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
    \]
- **Concentrations in the solution:**  
  Total volume after adding \( 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of NaOH:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
  - \([ \text{CH₃COOH} ] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}\),  
  - \([ \text{CH₃COO⁻} ] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}\).

- **pH at 25% titration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right).
  \]
  - \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \).  
  - Ratio:  
    \[
    \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} = \frac{1}{3}.
    \]
  - \(\log(1/3) = -0.477\).  
  - \(\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25\).  
  This rounds to \( 4.26 \).

---

### **3. Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \) of acetic acid has been neutralized to \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \) of CH₃COO⁻. The solution contains only the conjugate base (acetate ion), which hydrolyzes in water to produce a basic solution.

- **Concentration of CH₃COO⁻:**  
  Total volume at equivalence point:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
  \]
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- **pH at equivalence point:**  
  The acetate ion acts as a weak base. Its \( K_b \) is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
  Using the formula for the hydrolysis of a weak base:  
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.0200)} = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  - \(\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48\).  
  - \(\text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\).
