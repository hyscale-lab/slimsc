Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. 

The setup: Two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

So, Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period compared to planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method relates to the velocity of the star. Because a planet's mass causes the star to move in a small orbit. The velocity of the star is detected via the Doppler shift. So the shift in wavelength (the spectral line shift) is proportional to the star's velocity.

So, the formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. But maybe in this case, the units are in milliangstroms, so we can relate that to velocity.

Wait, but how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? Oh, right, the velocity of the star depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. There's a formula from Kepler's laws involved here.

I think the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the planet's orbital period is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(something). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude. 

Right, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) ] * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, star is like Sun, which is 333,000 Earth masses), M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the term (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) is roughly M_star^(2/3), and (1 + M_planet/M_star) ≈ 1. So the equation simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/1) ?

Wait, no, let me get this right. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, and sin i ≈ 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal). So,

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Hmm, but does G have units that will give velocity when everything is plugged in? I think so, since G has units of m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

But maybe an easier way to approach this is to consider that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but wait, no. Let me think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law in the context of the star's motion: the star's orbit around the barycenter. The period P is the same as the planet's period.

The star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I think is:

K = (2π a * sin i) / P

Where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since the orbits are circular, sin i is 1.

But a is related to the planet's orbit. Specifically, the star's semi-major axis is a_star = ( (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ) * a_planet ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet, because M_planet is much smaller than M_star.

So, a_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet.

Substituting back into K:

K ≈ (2π * (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet) ) / P

But from Kepler's third law, a_planet^3 = (G (M_star + M_planet) P^2 ) / (4π²). Again, M_planet << M_star, so a_planet^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 π² )

So a_planet ≈ [ ( G M_star P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Substituting a_planet into K:

K ≈ (2 π (M_planet / M_star) * [ ( G M_star P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) ) / P

Simplify this expression.

Let me compute each part:

Let me factor out constants and variables.

First, (G M_star P² )^(1/3) = (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)

And 4 π² is a constant. So [ (G M_star P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) = (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3)

So putting that back into K:

K ≈ ( 2 π (M_planet / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) / P

Let me write this as:

K = (2 π) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3) / P

Simplify the exponents:

P^(2/3) / P = P^(2/3 - 3/3) )= P^(-1/3)

So now,

K = (2 π) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3 )

Let me combine the constants:

(2 π) / (4 π² )^(1/3) = (2 π) / ( (4)^(1/3) * (π² )^(1/3) ) )

Simplify each part:

4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3), and π²^(1/3) = π^(2/3).

So,

= (2 π) / ( 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} } * π^{1 - 2/3} }

= 2^{1/3} * π^{1/3} } = (2 * π )^(1/3 )

So K ≈ (2 π )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star) ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me check that again. I think I might have made a miscalculation there. Let me redo that part.

We have:

(2 π) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) )

= 2 π / (4^(1/3) (π²)^(1/3) )

= 2 π / ( (2^2 )^(1/3) * π^(2/3) )

= 2 π / ( 2^(2/3) * π^(2/3) )

Factor 2: numerator is 2, denominator 2^(2/3). So 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) )= 2^(1/3)

Factor π: π / π^(2/3) = π^(1 - 2/3) )= π^(1/3 )

So overall, that part becomes 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) )= (2 π )^(1/3 )

So, K ≈ (2 π )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) ) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, but let's factor terms with M_star:

(M_planet / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3 ) = M_planet * G^(1/3) * M_star^( -1 + 1/3 ) ) = M_planet G^(1/3) M_star^( -2/3 )

So,

K ≈ (2 π )^(1/3) * M_planet G^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3) ) * P^(-1/3 )

Hmm, but I think I can rearrange this as:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

Which is the same as the initial approximation. So, K is proportional to ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But wait, in this problem, both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass (solar-like). So M_planet and M_star are the same for both planets.

So for planet #1 and #2, M_planet is same, M_star same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ) for each, because all other factors are same.

So K1 / K2 = ( P2^(1/3 ) ) / ( P1^(1/3 ) )

Wait, wait. Because K is proportional to 1 / ( P^(1/3) ), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3 ), K2 = C / P2^(1/3 ).

So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3 )) ) / ( C / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2^(1/3 )) / ( P1^(1/3 ) )

Which is ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5 mA, K2 is 7 mA. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

Because the shift for planet #2 is higher, so K2 > K1.

Wait, no, the shift is given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So the RV semi-amplitude K is larger for planet #2 than #1, so K2 > K1.

So K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But according to the proportionality, K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So,

5/7 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides,

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So, planet #2's period is about 0.364 times that of planet #1's period. So the question is "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1". Wait, wait, that's the key.

Wait, the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So we're looking for P2/P1. So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times the period of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the multiplier is less than 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36. 

Looking at the options, Option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up K1 and K2? Let me double-check.

Because if K is higher, that implies a lower period, because K is inversely proportional to P^1/3.

So higher K means shorter period. So planet #2 has higher K (7 mA) than planet #1 (5 mA). So planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1, so P2 is smaller than P1. So P2/P1 is less than 1.

In the calculation, P2 = (5/7)^3 P1, so P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer; it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the correct option is A.

So the answer should be option A, approximately 0.36.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), assuming the masses of the planets and stars are the same. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For planet #1 and planet #2, the RV semi-amplitudes are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \), respectively. Since \( K_2 > K_1 \), planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1. The ratio of the periods can be derived using the proportionality:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \, P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as this would imply planet #2 has a longer period, which contradicts the higher \( K_2 \) value.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as this is unrelated to the calculated ratio.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as this does not match the derived ratio.

The correct answer is **A**, approximately 0.36.
