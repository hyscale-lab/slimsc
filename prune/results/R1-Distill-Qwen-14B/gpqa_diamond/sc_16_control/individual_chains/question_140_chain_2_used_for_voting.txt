Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, same number of neutrons and protons—that means the gas is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So, like, for example, maybe something like O-16, but wait, O has 8 protons. Wait, no, wait. If each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons, that would make it a molecule where each atom is of an element where the number of neutrons equals protons. So for each atom, protons = neutrons. So that would mean each atom is of an element with an even atomic number, like maybe carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons would make it C-12). Or oxygen would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons, which would be O-16. Or hydrogen? But hydrogen has only one proton, so if it's the same as neutrons, but hydrogen usually has no neutrons. Hmm, maybe it's something else.

Wait, but the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons. So for example, if it's H2O, each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0 each, O has 8, so 8. So 10 vs 8—no, that's not equal. So maybe CO2? Each C is 6, O is 8. So in CO2, two O's: total protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (since C-12 has 6), each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. So the molecule would have 22 each. That fits. But wait, does a molecule like CO2 have two atoms? No, CO2 is a triatomic molecule. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. Let's check: O has 8 protons. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So in O2, each O atom contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 16, total neutrons: 16. So they are equal. That fits. So the gas W could be O2.

Wait another possibility is H2. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it. Or maybe CH4? Carbon has 6 protons, each H has 1. So 6 + 4 = 10 protons. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, each H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 vs 6—nope, not equal.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something else. Let's think of other possibilities. Could it be O3? Then 3 O's. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons 24, neutrons 24. That's equal. So O3 would qualify as gas W. But O3 is less common than O2. So perhaps the gas is O2.

So the reaction between X and Y produces O2. Another possibility is CO, because each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (like C-12), each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So in CO, protons: 6 +8=14, neutrons:6 +8=14. So that's equal. So CO could be gas W. Hmm, but CO is a gas, but is it likely to be produced in a violent reaction? I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction releases gas W. Let me think about the reaction. Substance X reacts with liquid Y, which could be water or something like that. If X is a metal, perhaps Y is water, and the reaction produces H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the neutron and proton count. So maybe not.

Alternatively, if X is a metal and Y is acid, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the other parts.

Then, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. Wait, no, 273 K is 0°C, so 277 K is about 4°C. Common substances that melt around there... maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a solid like ammonium chloride? No, that's a different melting point. Or perhaps water itself? But that melts at 273 K. Wait, unless B is something else. Maybe it's a compound that decomposes upon heating to release something else.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate. Heating a carbonate would release CO2 and form the corresponding oxide. But wait, what's the melting point of B? If B is water, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if B is CO2, but that's a gas.

Wait, maybe B is a solid. Let me think about what solid has a melting point near 277 K. Let me recall: 277 K is approximately 4°C. So maybe B is water, but that would be a liquid. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid like dry ice (CO2), but dry ice sublimates at standard pressure, not melts. Wait, but maybe B is a different substance.

Wait, another thought. If the precipitate G is something like calcium carbonate, but when heated, it decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. But carbon dioxide is a gas. Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide, which upon heating produces something else.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if Y is water, and X is a metal, then G might be a metal hydroxide. Heating a metal hydroxide might produce a metal oxide and water. But the melting point of B (the product) would be that of the oxide. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate, like calcium carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into calcium oxide and CO2. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, but the melting point of CO2 is about 5.68 atm, but under normal pressure, it sublimates. Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a chloride. For example, if X is sodium and Y is water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's look at the other part of the question. The product of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms.

Keto acid: a carboxylic acid with a ketone group, so something like acetoacetic acid, which has the structure CH3C(O)CH2COOH. Wait, but when this reacts with X, what happens? Maybe X is a strong base, like NaOH. A keto acid would react with a base to form a salt. For example, acetoacetic acid (which is a keto acid) would react with NaOH to form sodium acetoacetate, water, etc. But the product would have more oxygen atoms. Let's think about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Wait, the product of the reaction has 2 O atoms. So maybe the product is something like a diethyl ether or something with two O's. Wait, but the product is formed by a reaction with a keto acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, the product has 2 O atoms. Let's think about the possible product. For example, if the keto acid is reacting with a base, maybe the product is a salt. Let's take a simple keto acid, like pyruvic acid (CH3-C(O)-COOH). If it reacts with a base like NaOH, the product would be Na+ and the conjugate base, which is CH3-C(O)-COO^- Na^+. But that's a mono-sodium salt, and the structure has more than two O's. Wait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like an alcohol. Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a di-ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, which has three O's. No, the product has two O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. But how would a keto acid react to form a ketone? Maybe via decarboxylation. For example, when a keto acid like acetoacetic acid is heated, it can lose CO2 to form acetone. So if X is a reagent that induces decarboxylation, like a strong base, then the product would be a ketone, which has one O atom. But the problem says the product contains 2 O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic structure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the substance X. The question says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an element with a heavier isotope. So maybe X is a metal with a common isotope and a heavier one, like chlorine (Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl), or maybe carbon (C-12 and C-13, but 13 is rare). Or perhaps it's something else.

Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So X is a reagent in organic reactions. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, LiAlH4, etc. Alternatively, maybe it's something like H2O or another common reagent.

Wait, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent. But its analogs? Alternatively, maybe X is a strong base. Let me think.

Wait, but if X reacts with liquid Y to produce O2 gas, perhaps Y is a strong acid, and X is a metal. For example, if Y is a strong acid like H2SO4, and X is a metal like zinc, then the reaction would produce hydrogen gas. But earlier I thought gas W is O2, but if it's H2, then the protons and neutrons wouldn't match. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid but something else. Let's think again about the production of O2 gas. When would a reaction produce O2? Maybe if X is a metal and Y is a solution containing a peroxide. Wait, for example, if X is sodium and Y is H2O2. Wait, no, sodium reacts with H2O2 to produce O2. Let me recall: 2 Na + H2O2 → 2 NaOH + O2↑. Yes, that reaction produces O2 gas. So in this case, gas W would be O2, which has 16 protons each O atom, so each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So the molecule O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the molecule. That fits the condition. So gas W is O2.

So, if Y is H2O2 (liquid), and X is Na. Then X (Na) reacts with H2O2 to produce NaOH and O2. But wait, sodium is a metal, and H2O2 is a liquid. So that fits.

But wait, let me check. Sodium reacts with H2O2 at high temperatures? Or maybe it's a different metal. Alternatively, maybe it's potassium or another alkali metal.

But wait, if X is sodium (Na), then it consists of Na atoms. Sodium has an atomic number of 11. Its isotopes include 23Na (most common, with 11 protons and 12 neutrons), and 25Na (11 protons, 14 neutrons), which is less common. So X (sodium) has a heavier isotope, which is 25Na. So the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope, which in this case, sodium does have 25Na as an isotope.

So, if X is sodium, then when it reacts with H2O2, it produces NaOH and O2. So Y is H2O2, which is a liquid under certain conditions (concentrated, maybe). The precipitate G would be NaOH? Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base and would dissolve in water. Unless the reaction produces something else, like a hydroxide that precipitates. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. Let me think again.

Wait, sodium (Na) reacting with H2O2. The reaction is: 2 Na + H2O2 → 2 NaOH + O2↑. So the products are NaOH and O2. But NaOH is a soluble solid? Or a liquid? NaOH is a solid, but in the reaction, it would be in solution perhaps, but I'm not sure about precipitation. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another liquid, like water.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal that reacts with water to produce H2 gas, but that doesn't fit because the gas has O2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a peroxide itself. Or maybe it's a different metal. Let's think of another reaction that produces O2 when a metal reacts with a liquid.

Wait, another reaction: when H2O2 decomposes, it can produce O2. But that's not involving a metal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a nitric acid solution to produce O2. But I'm not sure about that either.

Wait, going back, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate. Because when a metal reacts with a carbonate solution, it can form a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about the precipitate. If the reaction between X and Y produces O2, and produces a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

If Y is H2O2, and X is Na, then the reaction gives NaOH and O2. NaOH in solution would be aqueous, but if the solution becomes supersaturated, perhaps a precipitate forms. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of another compound. Let me think differently. Perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is a metal. So the reaction is a double displacement, producing a metal carbonate and CO2 gas. But earlier, we thought gas W is O2, which doesn't fit with CO2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to tie in other parts of the question.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. What could that product be?

If X is a base, perhaps the reaction is a neutralization. For example, a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacting with a base (like NaOH) would form a salt and water. The salt would have the formula Na+ and the conjugate base. Let's take acetoacetic acid: CH3-C(O)-COOH. Reaction with NaOH might produce CH3-C(O)-COO^- Na^+ plus water. The product would have more than two O's. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that dehydrates the keto acid. For example, if X is something like PCl5, which can act as a dehydrating agent. But I'm not sure how that would lead to two O's in the product.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a reducing agent. For example, LiAlH4 reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but I'm not sure how that ties into the product having two O's.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. If the keto acid undergoes esterification, but that would require another alcohol, which I'm not sure X is providing.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. If the keto acid loses water, it could form a diketone. Let's see: for example, acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) can lose a water molecule to form CH3COCH2CO, but that's not correct because that's not a standard reaction. Alternatively, maybe decarboxylation occurs, but that would produce a ketone with one O.

Wait, this is tricky. Maybe the product is an ether. If X is a base that helps in forming an acetal. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2O, but that's not likely since it's a reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, another angle: the product has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a molecule like CO2 (but that's a gas), or maybe something like O2, but that's the gas W.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but how would a keto acid react to form a diol? Perhaps via a reduction, but the product would have two OH groups, which would mean more O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a simpler approach. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine gas W: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Likely O2, since each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons.

2. Determine Y and X: X reacts with Y to produce O2. Possible reaction: Na + H2O2 → NaOH + O2↑. So X is Na, Y is H2O2.

3. The precipitate G: NaOH is a strong base, but in solution, it's soluble. Unless it's a different product. Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, but no, that doesn't fit the reaction.

Wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Let me think of another possibility. What if X is a metal and Y is a solution containing a peroxide ion? For example, in a basic solution, a metal might react with a peroxide to produce O2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a peroxide, like Na2O2. Wait, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a nitric acid solution, which can produce O2 under certain conditions. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with a solution of H2O2 to produce O2, and the other product is a metal oxide or hydroxide which precipitates. For example, if X is iron, and Y is H2O2, under acidic conditions, it might form Fe^3+ which is in solution. But I'm not sure about precipitation.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate. Let's say X is a metal carbonate and Y is an acid. But then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas, not O2. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction between X and Y is a decomposition reaction. For example, X is a peroxide that decomposes in the presence of Y to produce O2 and another product. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution that contains a compound which, when X is added, decomposes to produce O2. For example, if Y is a solution of sodium hydroxide and X is potassium permanganate under acidic conditions. Wait, that could produce O2, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to think about the last part. The product of the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of a reaction that would produce a molecule with two O's. For example, forming an ether? Or perhaps a ketone.

Wait, another approach: if X is a base, and the keto acid reacts to form a salt and water. But the product would have more O's. Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent that oxidizes the keto acid to a compound with two O's. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, heating a keto acid with X (like P2O5) could dehydrate it, but I'm not sure how that would produce two O's.

Wait, another thought: the product has 2 O's. Maybe it's an ester with two O's, like methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3), which has three O's. No, that's three. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound. For example, if the keto acid loses CO2, it becomes a ketone, which has one O. But the product would have one O, not two.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. For example, if the keto acid undergoes a reaction to form a compound with two ketone groups. But that would require losing a COOH group, which is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, which has three O's, but that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, but how would that happen? Maybe the keto acid is undergoing a reduction. For example, if X is a reducing agent like LiAlH4, it could reduce the keto acid to a diol. Let's see: keto acid (RC(O)COOH) → RCH2CH2OH. No, that would have more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal, but that would require reaction with an alcohol.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think about the options for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Let's think about what elements X might have.

If X is sodium, which has two isotopes: 23Na and 25Na. The lightest element in X would be sodium, and perhaps another element? Wait, X is a substance, which could be a compound. Wait, the question says X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is an element like chlorine (Cl), which has 35Cl and 37Cl. So if X is Cl, then the lightest element is Cl, but that's only if X is a pure element. Or perhaps X is a compound containing Cl and another element.

Wait, if X is Na, then it's a single element. So the lightest and heaviest elements in X are both Na. So their atomic masses would be 23 and 25, but wait, Na's isotopes are 23 (mass 23), 24 (mass 24, very rare), and 25 (mass 25, even rarer). So if X is sodium, the lightest isotope is 23, the heaviest is 25. So the cumulative atomic masses would be 23 + 25 = 48. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound. Let me think. If X is NaOH, for example, it contains Na (23), O (16), and H (1). The heavier isotope would be in Na. So the lightest element in X is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). So their atomic masses would be 1 + 23 = 24, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if X is something like Cl2, a diatomic molecule. Cl has isotopes 35Cl and 37Cl. The lightest element is Cl (35), and the heaviest is Cl (37). So the sum would be 35 + 37 = 72, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, one being the heavier isotope. Let's say X is HCl. Hydrogen's lightest isotope is H (1), and Cl's heaviest is 37. So the lightest element (H) has mass 1, the heaviest (Cl) has 37. So sum is 1 + 37 = 38. Not an option.

Hmm, another approach. The options are 35 (A), 25 (B), 31 (C), 29 (D). Let's see which pairs add up to these numbers.

Option B is 25. That could be 12 (C) +13 (C)—no, because same element. Or maybe 12 (C) +13 (N)—wait, 12+13=25. So if X contains C and N, then the lightest element is C (mass 12), heaviest is N (mass 14 or 15?), but wait, 12 +13=25. Hmm, but elements can't have that.

Wait, perhaps it's 15 (N) +10 (Ne). No, 15+10=25. But Ne is noble gas, probably not in X.

Alternatively, perhaps 14 (Si) +11 (Na) is 25. But 14+11=25. So if X contains Na (11) and Si (14), their sum is 25.

Alternatively, 16 (O) + 9 (F) = 25. 16 +9=25. So perhaps X contains F and O.

Wait, but the question says X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So if X is a compound where one element has a heavier isotope, like Cl in HCl.

Wait, another thought. Let's think of X as a diatomic molecule where one element has isotopes. For example, O2. But O has 16O, 17O, 18O. So the lightest is O-16 (16), the heaviest is O-18 (18). Sum is 34, which is not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound like NaOH, but as discussed earlier, sum would be 1+23=24, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the reagent part. The question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2O, THF, etc. But which of these have isotopes?

NaOH contains Na, which has isotopes. So if X is NaOH, then constituent elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So 1 +23=24, not an option.

Wait, but maybe X is another reagent. For example, HCl is a reagent, but as before, sum would be 1+37=38, not an option.

Wait, another thought. What if X is a halogen with isotopes, like Cl2. The lightest isotope is 35Cl, the heaviest is 37Cl. Sum 35+37=72, not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a sugar or another organic compound. But the question states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, which suggests it's an element or a simple compound.

Wait, another angle. The product of the reaction with a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's think: if X is Na, and the reaction is Na + keto acid → product with two O's.

Wait, a possible reaction is the formation of a sodium salt of the keto acid. For example, sodium acetoacetate. The formula is Na+ [CH3COCH2COO^-]. The structure has four O's, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a reducing agent, like LiAlH4, which reduces the keto acid. For example, LiAlH4 reduces acetoacetic acid to acetyl alcohol (a diol). The diol would have two OH groups, hence two O's. So the product would have two O atoms. That fits.

So if X is LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid like acetoacetic acid, it reduces it to a diol (like acetyl alcohol), which has two O atoms.

Looking back at the rest of the question: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (O2), precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (melting point ~277 K). So what's Y?

LiAlH4 is a solid, so when it reacts with a liquid Y to produce O2. Let me think: LiAlH4 can react with certain oxidizing agents to produce H2 or other gases, but I'm not sure about O2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water. LiAlH4 reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas, not O2. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me try to think of X as another reagent. Maybe X is something like H2O2, but that's a liquid. No, the question says X is a substance, likely a solid.

Wait, perhaps X is potassium permanganate (KMnO4). When it reacts with a reducing agent, it can produce O2. But I'm not sure about the reaction with a keto acid.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like H2O, but that's a liquid.

Wait, let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, it forms G, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). What's a substance that releases something when heated and has a melting point around there?

If B is water, which melts at 273 K (0°C), but 277 is 4°C. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium hydroxide, but its melting point is higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium carbonate, but its melting point is around 850°C. No, that's too high.

Alternatively, if G is sodium carbonate, heating it might release CO2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Let me think: if G is a carbonate, heating it gives CO2 and the metal oxide. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, but the melting point is about 5.68 atm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like ammonium chloride, but that's not relevant.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Let me try to tie everything together.

If X is sodium, Y is H2O2, gas W is O2, precipitate G is NaOH. But NaOH is a strong base, soluble in water, so perhaps it's not a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces another compound.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, and X is a metal. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, but earlier we thought gas W was O2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a peroxide solution, leading to O2 gas. The precipitate G would be the metal oxide or hydroxide. Let's say X is Fe, Y is H2O2. The reaction could produce Fe(OH)2 or Fe(OH)3, which might precipitate. But when heated, Fe(OH)2 would decompose into FeO and water. The melting point of FeO is about 1360°C, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that, upon heating, releases H2O and forms a metal oxide. But B would be H2O, which melts at 273 K.

Wait, but the melting point of B is ~277 K, which is close to 273 K (0°C). So perhaps B is water. But when G is heated, it releases B. So G could be a hydrate. For example, a metal hydroxide with water of crystallization. When heated, the water is released (B is H2O), and the hydroxide turns into an oxide.

For example, sodium hydroxide in its hydrated form, NaOH·H2O. When heated, it loses water (B is H2O), and becomes anhydrous NaOH. But the melting point of B (H2O) is 273 K. So that fits.

So putting it all together:

- X is sodium (Na), which has isotopes (23Na, 25Na).
- Y is H2O2 (liquid).
- Reaction: 2 Na + H2O2 → 2 NaOH + O2↑.
- The precipitate G is NaOH·H2O (a hydrated hydroxide which precipitates? Or perhaps another compound).
- Upon heating G, it releases H2O (B), which has a melting point of 273 K (close to 277 K as per the question).
- The product of X and a keto acid is sodium acetoacetate, which has four O's. Wait, but the product should have two O's. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is something else. Let me think: sodium reacting with a keto acid. For example, acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH) + Na → CH3C(O)CH2COO^- Na^+ + something. But that product would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. If X is a base, it could dehydrate the keto acid to form a ketone. For example, acetoacetic acid → acetone (which has one O). But the product should have two O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again.

Let me get back to the problem of the product. If the product has two O atoms, perhaps it's a molecule like CO2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether with two O's. But how would X contribute to that.

Wait, X is sodium. Sodium reacting with a keto acid: perhaps it's a neutralization reaction forming a sodium salt and water. For example, CH3COCH2COOH + Na → CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ + H2. But the product would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think: maybe X is a metal like Mg, which when reacts with a keto acid, forms a salt and releases O2. Wait, but earlier I thought O2 is the gas.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that, when reacting with a keto acid, forms a salt with two O's. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Then the product would have one O. But the question says two O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, if X is an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the rest.

This is really challenging. Let me try to think about the options again.

If the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 25 (option B), that could be 12 (C) + 13 (N) = 25. But that would require X to contain both C and N, which is possible if X is a compound like CH3NH2 (methylamine). But then, does X have a heavier isotope? Methylamine has C (12 and 13C), H (1H, 2H), and N (14N, 15N). So the heaviest isotope would be 15N, and the lightest is 1H. So their masses would add to 1 +15=16, which isn't 25.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements: one with atomic mass 10 (Ne) and another with 15 (P). But that's not likely.

Wait, another option: X is a diatomic molecule like Cl2. The lightest isotope is 35Cl (35), the heaviest is 37Cl (37). Sum is 72, which is not an option. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing Na and O, like NaO. But that's not a common compound; perhaps it's NaO2 (sodium peroxide). Sodium peroxide has Na (23) and O (16 each). So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 16 +23=39, not an option.

Another thought: X is NH3. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is N (15). Sum is 16, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is CO2. Lightest is C (12), heaviest O (18). Sum is 30, not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: looking at the options, 29 is option D. Let's think of elements that add up to 29.

Possible pairs: 12 (C) +17 (N) = 29. Or 13 (Al) +16 (S) = 29? No, 13 +16=29. Wait, 13 is Al, 16 is S. So that's 29.

So if X is a compound of Al and S. But Al and S would form Al2S3, which is a possible compound. The lightest element is Al (13), the heaviest is S (32). Wait, 13 +32=45, not 29.

Wait, another pair: 14 (Si) +15 (P) = 29. So if X contains Si and P. But then, the lightest would be Si (14), heaviest P (31). Sum 45. Not matching.

Alternatively, 1 (H) + 28 (Si) = 29. But that's not it.

Wait, 29 could be 24 (Mg) +5 (B) =29. So if X is MgB. But MgB is not a common compound.

Alternatively, 20 (Ca) +9 (F) =29. So X could be CaF. But CaF is not a common compound; CaF2 is more common.

Alternatively, 12 (C) + 17 (N) =29. So if X contains C and N, like in a compound like ammonium carbonate or something. But then the lightest is C (12), heaviest N (15). 12 +15=27, not 29.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, each contributing one isotope. For example, if X is HCl, then H is 1, Cl is 37. 1 +37=38, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with elements that have the same atomic number but different isotopes. Wait, no, same element can't have different atomic numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two isotopes of the same element, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound that includes two different elements, each having isotopes. For example, X is NaCl, which has Na (23 and 25) and Cl (35 and 37). The lightest element is Na (23), heaviest is Cl (37). Sum is 23 +37 =60, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements that have light and heavy isotopes, but the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses is one of the options.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of the elements whose lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses sum up to one of the options.

For example:

- Hydrogen (H): lightest is 1H (1), heaviest is 2H (2). Sum: 3. Not an option.
- Carbon (C): lightest 12C (12), heaviest 14C (14). Sum: 26. Not an option.
- Nitrogen (N): 14N (14) and 15N (15). Sum: 29. Oh, that's option D.

So if X is a substance where one of its constituent elements is nitrogen, which has isotopes 14N and 15N. Then, the lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is N (15). But wait, wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So X is a compound, so it has multiple elements. The lightest element in X would be H, and the heaviest would be N. So their masses would be 1 +15=16, not an option.

Wait, but if X is a substance that contains only nitrogen (like N2), then the lightest and heaviest elements are the same (N), so sum would be 14 +15=29. That's option D.

Ah, so X could be a nitrogen-based substance, like ammonia (NH3). But ammonia contains N and H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is N (15). So sum is 16. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a pure element which is nitrogen. But pure nitrogen is N2. So the lightest isotope is 14N, the heaviest is 15N. So the cumulative masses would be 14 +15=29. That's option D.

So, if X is a substance consisting of nitrogen (like N2 gas), then the lightest and heaviest isotopes are 14N and 15N. Their masses sum to 29, which is option D.

But how does this fit into the rest of the problem?

Let me think again. If X is nitrogen, Y would be a liquid that, when reacts with N2, produces O2 gas. But how would N2 react to produce O2? Well, under certain conditions, N2 can react to form NO or NO2, but those don't produce O2. Alternatively, perhaps in an electrolysis reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: maybe Y is a solution containing a peroxide, and X is a metal. The reaction produces O2. Let me think, but that brings me back to Na and H2O2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound that decomposes to produce O2. For example, potassium chlorate (KClO3) decomposes to KCl and O2 upon heating. But X is used as a reagent, and its analog is used in organic chemistry. Potassium chlorate is more of an inorganic reagent.

Wait, but earlier I was considering X as Na, which has isotopes. Let's think again about that scenario.

If X is Na, which has 23Na and 25Na isotopes, then the lightest isotope is 23 (23), the heaviest is 25 (25). Their sum is 23 +25=48, which isn't an option. So that can't be the case.

Wait, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is a compound, say, NaOH, the elements are Na, O, and H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, not an option.

But if X is a compound with two elements, each having isotopes. For example, X is NH3, which contains N and H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is N (15). Sum is 16, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydrocarbon, but that doesn't fit with the reaction producing O2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where the heaviest element is Cl (37), and the lightest is H (1). But sum is 38, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing O and another element. For example, CO. Then, O is 16, C is 12. Sum is 28, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is a substance that contains only oxygen. So O2 or O3. Then, the lightest and heaviest isotopes would be O-16 and O-18. Their masses are 16 and 18. Sum is 34, not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Earlier, I thought of nitrogen as a possible candidate because 14N +15N =29. So option D is 29.

If X is a substance with only nitrogen, then the sum is 29, which fits option D.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound that includes nitrogen and another element, where the lightest element is H (1) and heaviest is N (15). Sum is 16, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound that includes elements with lightest atomic mass 12 (C) and heaviest 17 (N), so 12+17=29. So X could be a compound like CH3NO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where the elements are C (12) and F (19), sum 31. That's option C.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think of the product of the reaction with a keto acid having two O's. If X is LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent, then the product would be a diol, which has two O's. Then, X is LiAlH4, which contains Li, Al, and H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28, which is not an option.

Hmm. I think I'm going around in circles here. Let me try to summarize what I have.

From the earlier analysis, I think X is Na. The reaction with Y (H2O2) produces O2. The precipitate G is NaOH, which upon heating releases H2O (melting point 273 K, close to 277 K). The product with a keto acid would be a sodium salt, which has more O's. But the product should have two O's, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Li. Let's see. Li reacts with H2O2 to produce O2. The product with a keto acid might form a lithium salt with two O's. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like Zn. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has two O's. Suppose it's a ketone. So the reaction could be a decarboxylation. For example, the keto acid loses CO2 and forms a ketone. So X might be a base that induces decarboxylation. But then, the product would have one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent that reduces the keto acid to a diol with two O's. So X is LiAlH4, which would fit. Then, the product is a diol with two O's. Then, the cumulative atomic masses in X (LiAlH4) would be Li (7), Al (27), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Maybe X is a metal that, when reacted with a keto acid, forms a salt with two O's. For example, if X is Mg, and the product is Mg salt with two O's. Not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the earlier analysis.

If the sum is 29, that points to option D. So I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, given its properties and reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W is O₂, where each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). This aligns with the reaction producing O₂ gas.

2. **Reaction of X and Y**: X reacts with liquid Y to produce O₂ and a precipitate G. A plausible reaction is sodium (Na) reacting with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), forming sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and O₂ gas:  
   \[
   2 \, \text{Na} + \text{H}_2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{NaOH} + \text{O}_2 \uparrow
   \]  
   Here, X is likely sodium (Na), which has isotopes (e.g., ²³Na and ²⁵Na).

3. **Precipitate G**: The precipitate G could be sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which, when heated, releases water (H₂O). The melting point of water is 273 K, which is very close to the stated 277 K, confirming B is H₂O.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: When X reacts with a keto acid, the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests a reaction like decarboxylation, where the keto acid loses CO₂ and forms a compound with fewer oxygen atoms, such as a ketone or diol.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: X is identified as sodium (Na), which has isotopes ²³Na and ²⁵Na. The lightest element in X is Na (atomic mass 23), and the heaviest is also Na (atomic mass 25). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are:  
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]  
   However, this does not match the options provided. Reconsidering the problem, if X is a nitrogen-based substance (e.g., N₂), the lightest isotope is ¹⁴N (14), and the heaviest is ¹⁵N (15). Their cumulative atomic masses are:  
   \[
   14 + 15 = 29
   \]  
   This matches option D.

Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are **29**.
