Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes several reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the shapes of molecules and their symmetry. Common symmetry groups include things like tetrahedral (Td), octahedral (Oh), etc. But wait, the options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Let me try to break down the reactions to identify what each compound might be.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a metal sulfide, but I'm not sure yet. Let's keep that in mind.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be a compound like a metal oxide or perhaps a highly reactive compound, maybe something like phosgene or something with high toxicity.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl and G is H2SO4, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 and G is HNO3? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, but the types of acids can give clues about the elements involved.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents include things like ethanol, water, maybe something like DMF, but more likely something simple. If D and B combine 1:1, perhaps they form something like HCl (if B is H and D is Cl?), but wait, B is a gas. Wait, but earlier, B was a gas reacting with solid A in the first reaction. Let me think about the possible gases for B and D.

Let me try to map out possible identities.

First, let's look at reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If D and B are gases, and their product is a solvent, perhaps H is something like H2O. But wait, H is a solvent, so maybe something like ethanol or methanol? Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe D is HCl gas and B is something that can react with HCl to form a solvent. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So A is a solid. Suppose A is sulfur (S8?), but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sodium sulfide reacting with sulfur? Hmm, not sure. Let's think of another approach.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Let's think about possible hydrolysis products. For example, if C is a sulfide, say S- or another anion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If C is SO3^2- (sulfite?), but that's not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like a metal sulfite. Alternatively, maybe C is SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), but that's a liquid, I think.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that upon hydrolysis forms a base and an acid. Wait, but F and G are acids. Oh, wait, but if C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, sodium sulfite: Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into NaOH (a strong base) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But that doesn't give two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. For example, if C is something like (NH4)2SO4 (ammonium sulfate), but upon hydrolysis, it would give NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (a strong acid)? But (NH4)2SO4 is a solid, and when dissolved in water, it dissociates into NH4+ and SO4^2-; the NH4+ hydrolyzes to produce NH3 and H3O+ (so weak acid), and SO4^2- might not hydrolyze much, unless in strong acidic conditions. Not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like a metal carbonate. Wait, but upon hydrolysis, a metal carbonate would give a metal hydroxide and CO2 (which is a weak acid). But then, where's the second acid?

Wait another angle: Let me think about the products of the first reaction. 8 equivalents of gas B reacting with A to form C. 8 is a lot, which makes me think that B is a diatomic gas, so perhaps O2, S8, but O2 is a diatomic. Wait, 8 equivalents could mean that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. So let's think: A is a solid, B is a diatomic gas.

If A is, say, Fe, and B is S (in gas?), but S is solid. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide, and B is a diatomic gas like H2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. Another approach: Let's think about possible products. The bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a bright red solid. Copper sulfate is blue, iron(III) oxide is reddish, but maybe something else. Oh! The bright red color makes me think of mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Or perhaps it's a product of sulfur in some form. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal complex with a red color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide or a sulfate. Wait, another thought: The first reaction produces C, which then reacts with D to produce E. E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like phosgene (which is O=CCl2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Alternatively, maybe it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt. Let's think: When C reacts with D, produces E. And when C reacts with water, it gives A plus two acids.

Let me think of a scenario where C is a sulfide. For example, suppose C is FeS. But when FeS reacts with an acid (like H2SO4), it produces FeSO4, H2S, which is a weak acid. But that doesn't fit because in the problem, C reacts with water, not an acid, to produce A, F, G.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. When Na2SO3 is hydrolyzed, it gives 2 NaOH and H2SO3. But that's just one acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But in this case, F and G would be NH3 and Mg(OH)2, but Mg(OH)2 isn't an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like CaSO4, but that doesn't seem to hydrolyze into acids.

Wait, another approach: If C is a metal sulfide, like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't really react, but if it reacts with an acid, it produces H2S. But the problem says that C reacts with water to produce A, F, G. So perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with water (slightly acidic) to form Ca(OH)2 and CO2. But that's only one acid (CO2 is a weak acid). Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a more complex compound. Let me think about the hydrolysis of a sulfite ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, leading to hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, if C is BeCl2, which can hydrolyze in water to form HCl and Be(OH)2. But Be(OH)2 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a polyatomic ion salt with two different anions. For example, if C is something like Cu(OH)SO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, if C is Cu(NO3)2, hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2 and HNO3. But again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). So D and B are gases that react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Solvents include something like H2O, but then B and D would have to be H2 and O2, perhaps. But then H would be H2O, but what's B and D? Alternatively, maybe B is HCl and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, if H is a solvent like ethanol (C2H5OH), then D and B would have to combine in a 1:1 ratio to make C2H5OH. But ethanol is produced from, say, C2H5Cl and H2O? No, that's hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is something else that reacts with Cl2 to form a solvent.

Wait, maybe B is H2O and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl and B is NH3. Their reaction would produce NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, if D is CO2 and B is something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about E being extremely hazardous. What's a compound that's bright red and reacts with D to form something dangerous? Maybe E is H2SO4? No, that's not red. Wait, another thought: Phosgene is O=CCl2, which is a toxic gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a thiol, but that's usually not extremely hazardous unless in large quantities.

Alternatively, maybe E is a cyanide compound, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall picture. The first reaction is A + 8 B → C. Let's think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and B is S. Fe reacts with S to form FeS. But FeS is a solid, not bright red. Or perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is carbon (solid), and B is oxygen (O2 gas). Then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with carbon could form CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na), and B is O2. Sodium reacts vigorously with O2 to form NaO2, but I'm not sure about the products.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible symmetry groups and see which compound E could have one of them.

Looking at the options: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D∞h suggests a linear molecule with high symmetry, like CO2 (which is linear but has D∞h symmetry), but wait, CO2 is linear but is a gas. Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule with a plane of symmetry and a twofold axis. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry. Or perhaps something like SO2, which is a bent molecule and has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the symmetry group of E. So perhaps I need to figure out what E is first.

Let me try to think of each step again.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Possible candidates for C could be something like Ag2S (which is black), but not red. Or maybe something like Fe(OH)3 (reddish-brown). Alternatively, perhaps C is PbCrO4, which is yellow. Hmm, not red.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a product of a reaction involving sulfur. For example, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2S gas. But H2S reacting in a 8:1 ratio with a metal? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide, and B is CO or another gas. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) is a bright yellow solid. Not red, though.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the bright red product is mercury(II) oxide (HgO), which is red. HgO can be formed when mercury reacts with oxygen. So perhaps A is Hg, B is O2. Then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with Hg would form HgO. But wait, the reaction would be Hg + O2 → HgO. But the stoichiometry isn't matching. Let's think: If 1 mole of Hg reacts with 1 mole of O2, it would form HgO. So 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of O2, but that's a lot. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red product is a chromium compound. For example, potassium dichromate is orange, not red. Maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfonic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal complex with a red color. For example, certain cobalt complexes can be red, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Fe(OH)3, which is a reddish-brown precipitate, but not bright red.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids, perhaps one is strong and the other weak. For example, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. Wait, but then the hydrolysis would produce a weak base and a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfide salt. For instance, if C is Na2S, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2S (a weak acid). But in the problem, the products are A (the original solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps when C is hydrolyzed, it's producing A (which could be S, the solid), and two acids.

Wait, but that would mean that C would have to be something like Na2S, which upon hydrolysis would produce S, H2S, and NaOH? Wait, no, Na2S hydrolyzes to give NaOH and H2S, but that doesn't produce S.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a more complex compound. Let me think: If C is a metal sulfide, say CuS. When CuS reacts with water, does it hydrolyze? Not much, unless in acidic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonate, like Na2CO3. When Na2CO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH and CO2. Again, only one acid.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the possible products F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc.

If F is HCl and G is H2SO4, then perhaps C is a chlorosulfate salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like NH4HSO4. When it reacts with water, it could produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). But then, where does A come into play?

Wait, wait. Let's think about the overall reactions.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red, solid).

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A (recovered) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio).

Hmm, perhaps H is a common solvent like H2O. If H is H2O, then D and B must react to form H2O. So, D and B are gases that react to form water.

Which gases when combined in a 1:1 ratio form H2O? Perhaps H2 and O2. But H2 and O2 can combine to form H2O, but that's an explosive reaction unless controlled.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else, but that doesn't fit because B is a gas. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, but then H would be H2O. So, in that case, D is O2 and B is H2. Then in reaction 1, A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C.

Wait, what solid reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio? That's a lot of H2. Maybe a metal that reacts with H2 under certain conditions, like Na or another active metal. For example, sodium reacts with H2 to form NaH, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2. Then, reaction 1 is a metal reacting with H2 to form a hydride. For example, Mg + H2 → MgH2, but I'm not sure about the ratio.

Wait, but 8 equivalents of H2 per 1 equivalent of A seems a lot. Maybe the reaction is something like A + 4 H2 → C. For example, maybe a metal like Fe reacting with H2 in the presence of a catalyst to form FeH2, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 1 is a reaction where A is a metal oxide, and B is H2. For example, Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and H2O, but that doesn't fit the product.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal sulfide, and B is H2S. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal carbonate, and B is H2. But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to give A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives the original solid A, and two acids. So, if C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, then hydrolysis would give a strong acid and a weak base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a sulfite and something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible forms of E. Since E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, and D is a gas. If E is highly hazardous, perhaps it's a gas like HCl, but I don't think so. Alternatively, E could be phosgene, which is O=CCl2 and is a toxic gas.

Wait, if E is phosgene, then what would D be? Well, phosgene is formed from the reaction of COCl2. So, perhaps D is Cl2 gas, and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form COCl2.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If E is phosgene, then D would be Cl2, and C would be CO. But CO is a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a chlorinated compound. Let me think about the reactions again.

Let me try to outline the possibilities step by step.

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid).
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).
3. C + H2O → A (recovered) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
4. D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio).

From reaction 4, D and B combine to form H, a solvent. Let's assume H is H2O. Then, D and B would have to be gases that react to form H2O. The most common way to make H2O from gases is H2 and O2. So, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. Then, H2 + O2 → H2O (with a spark or catalyst).

In that case, reaction 1 would be A (solid) + 8 H2 → C (bright red).

What solid reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? Hmm, perhaps it's a metal reacting with hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is a metal oxide, and reaction 1 is a reduction. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that doesn't result in a bright red product. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe3O4, which is a black solid. When it reacts with H2, it forms Fe and H2O. But that again doesn't give a bright red product.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple reduction. Another possibility: A is a metal carbonate, and B is CO2. But that doesn't fit with reaction 4, where B is H2.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about H being H2O. Maybe H is something else. Let's think of other solvents. For example, ethanol (C2H5OH) is a solvent. So D and B would combine in a 1:1 ratio to form ethanol. But how? Perhaps D is Cl and B is C2H5OH, but they're both gases?

Wait, no. B is a gas, D is a gas. So, for example, D could be Cl2 and B could be C2H5OH, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then D and B would have to be gases that react to form NH3. For example, D could be HCl and B could be NH3? But then they would react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is something else. Let's think about the reaction D + B → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's a diethyl ether or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a hydrocarbon like methane, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a simple inorganic solvent like methanol (CH3OH). So, D and B would have to be gases that react to form CH3OH. For example, D could be CO and B could be H2. Then, CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH (with a catalyst). But that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to think about E's structure. If E is a highly dangerous gas with a certain symmetry, what would that be?

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), it has a structure similar to CO2 but with Cl atoms. Wait, phosgene has a central carbon atom with two O and two Cl atoms? No, wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, I think. So the structure is a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is linear, with a central C atom, and the bonds are arranged as O=C-Cl2. Wait, no, actually, phosgene is O=CCl2, which has a central C with a double bond to O and single bonds to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is linear, similar to CO2. Symmetry-wise, that would be linear, so D∞h symmetry. Because in CO2, the symmetry group is D∞h, which includes a main C∞ axis and other symmetry elements.

Wait, but let me confirm. CO2 has a linear structure with O=C=O. Its symmetry group is D∞h. Phosgene, O=CCl2, is also linear, so it should have the same symmetry group, D∞h. So if E were phosgene, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, in the problem, E is produced when C reacts with D. If D is Cl2 and C is CO, then CO + Cl2 → CCl2O (phosgene). But how does that fit into the other reactions?

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

Wait, another possibility: E could be SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a toxic liquid, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Let's think: SO2Cl2 has a structure where S is in the center with two O and two Cl atoms. The structure is tetrahedral, so the symmetry group would be Td. But that's not one of the options. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another possibility: E could be Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), which is a toxic gas. Its structure is O2^2+ with four Cl^- ions around it, forming a tetrahedral structure. So again, Td symmetry, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts, and its structure is just H-Cl, so its symmetry group would be D∞h as well (since HCl is linear). But I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

Wait, but in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if F is HCl and G is another weak acid, perhaps like H2SO3 or H3PO4, then C might be a chloride sulfite or something. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl gas, but how would that fit into reaction 2, where C reacts with 2 D's to produce E. If D is Cl2, then perhaps C is H2.

Wait, but earlier reactions would have to make sense. Let me try to put this together.

If reaction 4 is D + B → H (solvent). Suppose H is H2O. Then D and B are H2 and O2. So in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 H2 to form C (bright red). What solid reacts with H2 to form a bright red product? Maybe a metal like Fe? Fe + H2 → FeH2? Not sure. Or perhaps A is a metal oxide, and reaction 1 is a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonate. Let's say A is FeCO3. Then reaction 1 could be FeCO3 + 8 H2 → Fe + H2O + CH3OH or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. Let's say A is FeS. Reaction with H2: FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. But that's not giving a bright red product.

Hmm, I'm really stuck on this. Let me try to think of another angle. Let's think about the possible symmetry groups and see which could fit.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. A molecule like H2O has C2v symmetry, not C2. Or maybe something like ethylene (C2H4) has D2h symmetry, not C2. Hmm.

B) D4h: This is a point group with a fourfold axis and horizontal mirrors. Molecules like SO4^2- have Td symmetry, but maybe something else. Alternatively, SO2 has D∞h symmetry, but I'm not sure.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry group for a linear molecule like CO2, HCN, etc. So if E is a linear molecule, its symmetry would be D∞h.

D) C2v: This is the symmetry group for molecules like H2O (bent), SO2 (bent), etc. So if E were a bent molecule, it would have C2v symmetry.

If E is a highly hazardous gas with linear structure, it would likely have D∞h symmetry. So the options are either C (D∞h) or D (C2v).

But what is E? If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a linear molecule, then it would have D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D.

So I need to determine what E is.

From reaction 2: C reacts with 2 D to form E. If D is Cl2 and C is CO, then CO + 2 Cl2 → CCl2O (phosgene). Phosgene is a linear molecule, so symmetry D∞h.

But let's check if that makes sense with the other reactions.

In reaction 4: D (Cl2) + B → H (solvent). So Cl2 + B → H. If H is H2O, then B would have to be O2. Because Cl2 + O2 → ? Wait, Cl2 and O2 reacting would form ClO2 or other compounds under certain conditions, but I don't think they form H2O. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: If H is a different solvent, perhaps H is something else. Let me think: If D is Cl2 and B is H2O, but B is a gas. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then, in reaction 4, H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl (a gas, not a solvent). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption about H is incorrect. Let me go back.

If reaction 4 is D + B → H (solvent), and H is a solvent like ethanol, perhaps D and B are gases that combine to form ethanol. But ethanol is a liquid, so perhaps it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a gas like NH3, but it's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Let's say reaction 4 produces a liquid solvent, like ethanol. So D and B are gases that react to form ethanol. For example, D could be C2H5Cl and B could be H2O, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, D is CO and B is H2. Then, CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. But the reaction ratio would be 1:2, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if D is CO and B is H2, maybe in a different ratio. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio, so that's not matching.

Wait, I think I'm stuck trying to find H, so perhaps I should try a different approach.

Let me try to summarize:

- E is a product of C and 2 D, and is extremely hazardous.
- E's structure determines its symmetry group.
- If E is phosgene, symmetry is D∞h.
- If E is SO2, symmetry is C2v.

But how do I determine which E is?

Looking back at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If E is phosgene, then D is Cl2 and C is CO. So reaction 3 would be CO + H2O → A + F + G. But that doesn't seem to make sense. Alternatively, if C is a chloride compound, like CCl4, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and F and G are different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is SOCl2. When SOCl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl (strong acid), SO2 (which isn't an acid), and HClO (which is a weak acid). Wait, but that doesn't fit because SO2 is a gas and not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. But the problem states that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2. When COCl2 reacts with water, it produces CO2, HCl, and HClO. HCl is a strong acid, HClO is a weak acid. So that would fit reaction 3.

So reaction 3: COCl2 + H2O → CO2 + HCl + HClO.

Wait, but then what is A? Because A is formed when C reacts with water. In this case, C is COCl2, and the reaction produces CO2, HCl, and HClO. So, where does A come from? Unless A is CO2, but CO2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm, that doesn't fit with reaction 1 where A is a solid.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again.

If C is a metal chloride, like AlCl3. When AlCl3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form Al(OH)3 and HCl. So, F would be HCl (strong acid), and G would be Al(OH)3, which isn't an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider E being a diatomic molecule, like Cl2O, which is dichlorine monoxide. It's a toxic gas. Its structure is bent, so its symmetry group would be C2v. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. But ozone isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If E is SO2, which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. SO2 is a toxic gas. So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Let me see if that makes sense in the context of the reactions.

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So what would D be? If D is O2, then perhaps C is something that reacts with O2 to form SO2. For example, if C is S (solid), then reaction 2 would be S + 2 O2 → SO2 + O2? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, if C is H2S, then reaction with O2 could produce SO2, but H2S is a gas, and C is a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. If C is FeS, then reaction with O2 could produce FeO and SO2. But FeS is a solid, so reaction 2 would be FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2 + ...? Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfur compound. Reaction 2: C + 2 D → SO2. So if D is O2, then C would be S. But S is solid, and reaction 1 would have to produce S as C. Let's see.

Reaction 1: A (solid) +8 B → S (bright red solid). So what's A and B here? If A is S, then reaction 1 would be S reacting with 8 equivalents of B to form S again? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2, and reaction 1 is some kind of oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2S. Then reaction 1 could be a metal reacting with H2S to form a metal sulfide (C) and H2 gas. But I'm not sure about the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should look at reaction 4 again. If H is a solvent formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. If E is SO2, then perhaps D is O2 and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps D is SO3 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible answers again. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule like phosgene or CO2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). If E is a bent molecule like H2O or SO2, symmetry is C2v (option D).

Given that E is produced from reaction 2 as a hazardous product, and considering that phosgene is a known toxic gas with linear structure, perhaps E is phosgene, leading to symmetry D∞h (option C).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O3, which is bent, then C2v would be the symmetry group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is HCl gas. Wait, no, HCl is a linear molecule (H-Cl), so D∞h symmetry. But HCl isn't extremely hazardous unless in large quantities. But perhaps in the context of the problem, it's considered extremely hazardous.

But then, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCl. So D would have to be Cl2, and C would be H2. But then in reaction 1, A (solid) + 8 B → H2. Hmm, not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Wait, another angle: Let me think about reaction 3. C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps F is HNO3 and G is H3PO4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is HClO. But that depends on C.

Wait, if C is a sulfonic acid chloride, like RSO2Cl2, then upon hydrolysis, it could produce RSO2OH (a weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). So in that case, F is HCl, G is RSO2OH, and A is RSO2Cl2? No, because A is the original solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorosulfonic acid, but I'm not certain.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry (option C), then the answer would be C. If E is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry (option D), the answer would be D.

Given that E is produced from a reaction involving Cl2 (if D is Cl2), and C is CO, forming phosgene, which is linear, I think E would have D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like mercury(II) oxide (HgO) or a sulfur-containing compound. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a toxic gas like phosgene (O=CCl₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂). Phosgene is linear, while SO₂ is bent, which would affect its symmetry group.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield these acids. For example, if C is phosgene, hydrolysis would produce HCl (strong acid) and HClO (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water, D and B could be H₂ and O₂, respectively. This aligns with the formation of water from these gases.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), it is a linear molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Linear molecules have **D∞h** symmetry.
- If E is sulfur dioxide (SO₂), it is a bent molecule with a central sulfur atom double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. Bent molecules have **C2v** symmetry.

Given the options provided:
- **C2**: Not applicable, as it lacks the necessary symmetry elements.
- **D4h**: Unlikely, as it corresponds to a fourfold axis and horizontal mirrors, which do not match the structure of E.
- **D∞h**: Matches the symmetry of a linear molecule like phosgene.
- **C2v**: Matches the symmetry of a bent molecule like SO₂.

Since the problem suggests E is extremely hazardous and likely a linear molecule (phosgene), its symmetry group is **D∞h**.

ANSWER: C
