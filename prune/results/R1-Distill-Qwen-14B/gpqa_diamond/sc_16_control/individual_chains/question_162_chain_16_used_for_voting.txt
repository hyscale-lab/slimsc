Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, the question is about a metric given in terms of x and y. The metric provided is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I'm trying to visualize what kind of geometry this represents.

The metric looks like it's in two dimensions because it's got dx² and dy². So it's a 2D Lorentzian metric, maybe? Because I see that the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That makes me think of something like the metric for a sphere but perhaps in a different space.

Wait, in Euclidean space, the metric for a sphere of radius a is like (dx² + dy²)/(a² - x² - y²), but that's for a 2-sphere. Oh wait, but in this case, it's 32/(4 - x² - y²). So maybe the denominator is (4 - r²) where r² = x² + y². So 4 would be like a squared radius, say a² =4, so a=2. So 4 - r² is 4 - (x² + y²).

Wait, but in the metric, this coefficient is multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm. So perhaps this is a conformally flat metric. Conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric.

In 2D, the area element for a metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. Wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal with both components equal to 32/(4 - r²). Wait, no, actually, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²), so the components g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - r²) and g_xy = 0.

So the determinant of the metric tensor g is (32/(4 - r²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - r²), so the area element is that multiplied by dx dy. So the area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is valid. The denominator 4 - r² must be non-zero, so r² <4, which means r <2. So the region is all (x,y) where x² + y² <4. That's a disk of radius 2.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. The pseudosphere usually refers to a surface in hyperbolic space, I think. But in this case, the metric is given in 2D, so perhaps it's representing a space with negative curvature. Alternatively, maybe it's a model of hyperbolic space.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the metric again. Let me write it in polar coordinates because that might make integration easier. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So in polar coordinates, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, so sqrt is 32/(4 - r²). Then the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ, because when you go to polar coordinates, you multiply by r.

So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π. So:

Area = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Hmm, wait, let me compute that integral.

First, the integral over θ is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So the area becomes 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial part. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r^2)] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

Wait, because substituting u=4 - r², r dr = (-du)/2.

So:

32 * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

Wait, but let me check the limits. When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So when I do the substitution, the integral becomes from 4 to 0, but because I changed variables, I can reverse the limits and remove the negative sign.

Wait, let me adjust that. The integral is from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0). So the substitution gives:

∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to2 = ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (r dr) / u ].

But r dr = (-du)/2, so [ (-du)/2 ] / u = (-1/(2u)) du.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du. Which is the same as ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/(2u)) du, because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

Wait, actually, that integral would be ∫ from 4 to 0 of (-1/(2u)) du = ∫ from 0 to4 (1/(2u)) du.

So ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] from 0 to2 = [ (1/2) ∫ du/u from u=0 to4 ].

Wait, but integrating 1/u du is ln|u| + C. So this becomes (1/2) [ ln(4) - ln(0) ].

Oh wait, hold on. ln(0) is undefined; it approaches negative infinity. So this integral would diverge, which would imply that the area is infinite.

Wait, but that's a problem. So the area is 2π multiplied by 32 times some integral that blows up. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, I have the integral ∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r^2) from 0 to 2.

Wait, wait: no, the integral I'm computing is ∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r^2 ), which I've transformed into 32 * ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²) ].

Wait, let me compute ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Set u =4 -r² → du= -2r dr → (−du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (−du/2 ) / u → ∫ from 4 to0 [−1/(2u)] du → ∫ from0 to4 [1/(2u)] du.

Which is (1/2) ∫ du/u from 0 to4 → (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

But ln(0) is -infinity. So the integral becomes (1/2)(ln(4) - (-infinity)) → (1/2) (infinity) → infinity.

So the radial integral is divergent, which implies that the area is infinite. So the area is infinite, right?

Wait, but the options don't directly have infinity. Let me look back at the options.

The options are:

A) 0
B) 4π(x² + y²)
C) 4π(x² - y²)
D) +infty

Wait, option D is +infty. So the area is infinite.

But wait, why would the area be infinite? The region where the metric is defined is x² + y² <4. So it's a disk of radius 2, but when we compute the area with this metric, it's infinite.

Wait, in the standard Euclidean metric, the area would be π*(2)^2 =4π. But here, with the given metric, it's different.

So the conclusion is that the area is infinite. So the answer should be option D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first note that the metric is conformally flat, meaning it is a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. The area element in such a metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r\cos\theta\), \(y = r\sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so the area becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, substitute \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is:

\[
A = +\infty.
\]
