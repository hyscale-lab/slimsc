Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Let me think about this step by step.

First, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and involve the commutator of gamma matrices.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the coupling constants should have dimensions less than or equal to 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, since the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 in four dimensions.

Wait, wait, no. The Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4 because the action S is dimensionless, and S is the integral of the Lagrangian over spacetime. Since [d^4x] is [Mass]^{-4}, the integrand (the Lagrangian) must have [Mass]^4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So each term in the interaction Lagrangian (like L_int here) must have dimension 4. So let's look at L_int: κ times ψ̄ times σ_{μν} times ψ times F^{μν}.

I know the dimensions of the fields. Fermion fields ψ, in four dimensions, have mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ =0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so the term with ∂_μψ must have the same dimension as mψ. So [ψ] = 3/2. Because for the term mψ, m is dimension 1, ψ is 3/2. So when you have [∂_μ ψ] = 1 + 3/2 = 5/2, which must match the other term. So yeah, [ψ] = 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism. F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each derivative gives a dimension of 1, and A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1 (since the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is (∂A)^2, each ∂A is dimension 2, so (∂A)^2 is dimension 4, which matches the Lagrangian).

Wait, so F^{μν} is the derivative of A, so each term in F is ∂A, which is dimension 1 (from A) +1 (from derivative) = 2. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, no: Wait, A has dimension 1. Because the Maxwell term is F^2, which is dimension (2)^2 =4. So each F is dimension 2, because F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each F has dimension [∂][A] = [1][1] = 1? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because F is a field strength tensor, and the Maxwell term is like F_{μν} F^{μν}, which has to have dimension 4. So each F has dimension 2 because 2+2=4. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check: The Maxwell Lagrangian is (1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}. Each F is two derivatives of A, so F has dimension [∂][A]. A has dimension 1 because the kinetic term is (∂A)^2, which is dimension 4. So each F is [1][1] = 1? No, because (∂A) would be [∂][A] = 1 +1 =2. So F is dimension 2. Because F is ∂ A, so each F is two dimensions? Wait, no, F is ∂ A, which is dimension 1+1=2. So [F] =2.

So now, let's compute the dimensions of each term in L_int.

L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each of these terms: ψ̄ is the same as ψ, so dimension 3/2. σ_{μν} is a matrix, so it doesn't affect the mass dimension. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) *1 * (3/2) )= 3/2 +3/2 = 3.

Wait wait, no. The σ_{μν} is a tensor made from gamma matrices, but in terms of mass dimension, it's just a number (like a coupling) because the gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless. So when we have ψ̄ σ ψ, each ψ is 3/2, and σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] = [ψ]^2 = (3/2)*2 =3.

So that part is dimension 3. Then we multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So so far, the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is 3 + 2 =5.

So the term κ times that must have dimension 4, because L_int must have dimension 4. So [κ] [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] *5 =4. Therefore, [κ] = (4-5) = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Wait, but wait, wait: No, wait, the term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Wait, [κ] [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] * [ψ]^2 [F] = [κ] * (3/2)^2 * 2. Let me compute that.

[ψ] is 3/2, so [ψ]^2 is (3/2)^2 =9/4. Multiply by [F] which is 2. So 9/4 * 2 = 9/2. So [L_int term] = [κ] * (9/2) =4 (since L must be dimension 4). So [κ] = 4 * (2/9) )=8/9? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) * (3/2) )=9/4. Then, F has dimension 2. So the product is 9/4 * 2 = 9/2. So [κ] must satisfy [κ] * (9/2) =4. So [κ] = 4 * (2/9) )=8/9. But that's a positive number, but looking at the options, the options for [kappa] are either -1 or 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions. Let me think again about F. F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each ∂ is dimension 1, A is dimension 1. So F has dimension 1 +1=2. So [F^{μν}] is 2.

So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [ψ]^2 [F] = (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4) *2 =9/2. So [κ] * (9/2) must equal 4. So [κ] = 4 * (2/9) = 8/9. But none of the options have 8/9. Wait, that's a problem because the options are either -1 or 1.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in how I count the dimensions. Let me double-check the structure of the term.

Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So perhaps I should consider the Lorentz indices. σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, and F^{μν} is a Lorentz tensor as well. So when you contract the indices, maybe that affects the dimension? No, I don't think so. Because Lorentz indices don't add to the mass dimension; they are just tensor structures. So the dimension comes from the fields and coupling constants.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with sigma. σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is dimensionless because gamma matrices are dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is dimension [ψ]^2, which is (3/2)^2 =9/4.

F^{μν} is dimension 2, so the product of that with (ψ̄ σ ψ) is 9/4 *2=9/2. So the term κ times that must have dimension 4. So [κ] =4 / (9/2) )=8/9. But that's 8/9. Hmm... but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of the Lagrangian. Let me think again. The Lagrangian is given as L_int=κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each field's dimension. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of the coupling elsewhere.

Wait another approach: Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So let's compute each term's dimension.

Each field's dimension:

- ψ: 3/2
- A (gauge field): 1
- F^{μν}: ∂μ Aν → [∂][A] = 1 +1 =2 → so [F]=2.

But wait, F is a tensor, so in four dimensions, the field strength F^μν has dimension 2. Because the Maxwell term is (F)^2, which is dimension 4.

So [F] = 2.

So the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) * (3/2) )=9/4.

F is 2, so the product is (9/4)(2) = 9/2.

So the entire term is κ times that, so [κ] * (9/2) =4 → [κ] = (4 * 2)/9 →8/9. Oh wait, but none of the options have 8/9. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the problem has a typo.

Wait, but looking at the options, all the options have [κ] as either -1 or 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the fields. Another way: The dimension of ψ is 3/2, correct. For the gauge field A, the dimension is 1. So F is ∂ A, which is dimension 1 +1=2. That's correct.

Lagrangian is dimension 4. So the product of the fields in each term must be dimension 4.

So, let me write the Lagrangian term as:

κ (ψ̄) (σ_{μν}) (ψ) (F^{μν} )

Each ψ is 3/2, so together ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) * (3/2) )= 3/2 +3/2 =3, but wait no: because ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension as ψ. So ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension (3/2) * (3/2) )= 9/4? Or do I add their dimensions? No, because they are multiplied. So (3/2) * (3/2) )= 9/4.

Then, F is 2. So product is 9/4 *2= 9/2.

So the term is κ * (9/2) =4 → [κ] = (4) / (9/2) )= 8/9. But that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the term. Could it be that the term is not ψ̄ σ F ψ, but something else? Or perhaps the term is similar to a coupling between two fermion fields and two vector fields. Wait, no, because F is a field strength, not A.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me think about the Feynman rules. The vertex would involve a coupling κ, and the dimension of the coupling is related to the dimension of the term in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the fields' dimensions. Let me double-check.

In four dimensions, the fields have the following mass dimensions:

- Scalar field φ: 1 (since (∂φ)^2 has dimension 4; each ∂φ is dimension 2, so φ is dimension 1)
- Fermion ψ: 3/2 (because (∂ψ)^2 is dimension 4 → each ∂ψ is dimension 3/2*2=3 → no, wait, no. Wait, the kinetic term for fermions is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So [ψ̄] = [ψ] =3/2. So [∂_μ ψ] = [∂][ψ] =1 + 3/2=5/2. So the term ψ̄ ∂ψ has dimension 3/2 +5/2 =4, which works.

Similarly, the gauge field A has dimension 1 because the Maxwell term is (∂A)^2 which is dimension 4. So [A]=1.

F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each term is ∂A, which is dimension 2 → F has dimension 2.

So back to L_int: [κ] [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =4.

[ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4)*2=9/2.

So [κ] =4 / (9/2) )=8/9. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the term is not correct. Maybe the σ_{μν} is being treated as an operator of certain dimension? No, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so it doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

Wait another thought: Oh! Maybe I'm supposed to consider the antisymmetrization or something else. Or perhaps the term is actually written with some derivative? Because sometimes, terms can have derivatives that affect the dimension.

Wait, looking at L_int: it's κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, no derivatives. So the only fields are ψ and F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of F. Let me think again.

The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each A is dimension 1, so each ∂A is dimension 2. So F is dimension 2.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the term is not a Lorentz scalar? No, because σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, and F is also a Lorentz tensor. Their contraction would form a scalar. So that's not the issue.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the dimension of the coupling. Wait, perhaps the term can be rewritten as a derivative coupling?

Wait, another approach: Let's write down the dimensions in terms of [κ].

We have [L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Each term in the product contributes additively. So [L_int] = [κ] + 2[ψ] + [σ] + [F].

Wait, no, each ψ is 3/2, and there are two ψs (ψ̄ and ψ). σ is a matrix but dimensionless, so [σ]=0. F has 2. So [L_int] = [κ] + (3/2)*2 + 0 + 2 = [κ] +3 +2 = [κ] +5.

But [L_int] must be 4, so [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah! That's the correct approach. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Because each field contributes additively to the dimension of the term. So when you multiply fields, their dimensions add.

So the term is κ multiplied by four fields: ψ̄ (3/2), σ (0), ψ (3/2), F (2). So the total dimension is [κ] + (3/2 +3/2 + 2) = [κ] + (3 +2) = [κ] +5.

Set this equal to 4: [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the next part: Is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling's dimension. In four dimensions, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤4. Wait, no, actually, the general rule is that a coupling with mass dimension d is renormalizable if d ≥ 0. Because the coupling can only have terms in the Lagrangian with dimensions ≤4. Wait, no, what's the exact condition.

Wait, in a renormalizable theory, all couplings must have mass dimension ≤4, but more specifically, the coupling's dimension must be non-negative. Because in the Dyson expansion, the coupling would be dimensionless (d=0), massive (d=1), etc. But I think the correct condition is that the coupling must have a dimension that is greater than or equal to zero. Because in a renormalizable theory, the interaction terms in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4, but each coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Wait, wait, let me think.

Wait, the dimension of the coupling is given by [coupling] =4 - sum of fields' dimensions.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, for a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the dimension is [g] +n [φ] =4. So [g] =4 -n [φ].

If [g] ≥0, then the term is renormalizable. So for a coupling to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0.

In our case, [κ]=-1. So that's [g] =-1, which is <0. Which implies that the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in 4 dimensions, the coupling must have dimension ≤4, but more precisely, for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be >=0. Because if [g] is negative, then as you increase the energy scale (like in loops), the coupling becomes stronger, leading to a Landau pole, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So in this case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. → No, because [κ] is -1, theory is not renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. → No.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. → Yes.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. → No.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$ (which has dimension $[A_\mu] = 1$) via $F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu$.

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ involves two fermion fields, so its dimension is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = [\psi]^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}.
\]
The field $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$, so the total dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\frac{9}{4} \times 2 = \frac{9}{2}.
\]
The Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have dimension $4$, so the dimension of $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - \frac{9}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the theory is not renormalizable.

### Step 4: Final Answer
From the analysis:
- The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$.
- The theory is not renormalizable.

Thus, the correct option is:

**C) The mass dimension $[\kappa]_M = -1$. The theory is not renormalizable.**
