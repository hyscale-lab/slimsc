Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The question gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Hmm, I think I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us about the stability of that complex.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is the main species here. But I'm a bit confused about whether it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. The formation constant K is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. I think the formula is something like K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] ).

So, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because some of it might dissociate, the actual concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be less than 0.02 M. Oh wait no, because if the complex is the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA, then we might have to consider their dissociation.

Wait, but wait, the EDTA is in excess or not? If the solution is just the complex, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be zero, and the complex is 0.02 M. But that seems unlikely because EDTA is a ligand that needs to be present to form the complex. Oh, maybe the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts, so that they form the complex.

Wait, maybe the solution is simply 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the complex dissociates to some extent. Let me think: the complex is [CaEDTA]^2- or something. So the dissociation reaction is [CaEDTA]^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given. Wait, but Kf is the formation constant for the complex. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, then assuming that the dissociation is negligible, [Ca²+] would be really low. Because Kf is a large number (5e10), indicating a very stable complex. So the dissociation would be minimal.

But wait, the problem says the concentration of Ca²+ in the solution. So I need to calculate [Ca²+].

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA, the concentration of both would be x. But wait, but initially, the EDTA might not be in excess. Hmm, wait, because the solution is just the Ca-EDTA complex, the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA is from the dissociation of the complex. So, according to that, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so high, I think x would be really small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(2e-13) → sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 1.414e-6.5. Wait, wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12, so 2e-13 is 2e-13, so sqrt(2e-13) is sqrt(2)*1e-6.5? Wait, no, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12, so 2e-13 is 0.2e-12, so sqrt is about 0.447e-6, which is 4.47e-7. Wait, but let's calculate it more accurately.

Wait, x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) → 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*1e-13, square root is 2*1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. That's approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**
