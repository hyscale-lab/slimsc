Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, and both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means we can apply certain statistical mechanics here.

Wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the thermal energy of the material. So maybe this has to do with Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states at thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the degeneracy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. Since the question is about excitation, I think the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1 because excitation is moving to a higher energy state.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. But wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as those in star 2. So the ratio of the excited states in star 1 compared to star 2 is 2:1. Let me denote n1 as the number of excited atoms in star_1 and n2 in star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, I think the excitation is the population in the higher energy level. So the ratio n_upper / n_lower is what the Boltzmann factor gives. So star_1's ratio is twice as high as star_2's. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Or wait, maybe the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation state is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level in star_1. So the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the ground state is higher for star_1.

So let's denote the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. Then, for each star, the ratio is n2_upper / n2_lower.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is the same for both, so ΔE is the same. So for star_1, the ratio is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ), and for star_2, it's (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ). Since both stars likely have the same g2/g1 ratio, that factor cancels out when taking the ratio of the two.

So the ratio of the excited states for star_1 to star_2 is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

Wait, no. Let me re-express that. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n_upper) / (n_lower) for star_1. Similarly, R2 = (n_upper) / (n_lower) for star_2.

So, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_upper/g_lower)
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_upper/g_lower)

If g_upper/g_lower is the same for both stars, then R1/R2 = exp( (-ΔE)/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

But the problem states that R1 = 2 R2. Because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting, 2 R2 = R2 * exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

Divide both sides by R2 (assuming R2 isn't zero), we get 2 = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)

Factor out ΔE/(k): ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, rearranged, that would be ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ].

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, substituting back, ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ].

But the question gives us that the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So that's a known value. But wait, isn't k (Boltzmann's constant) known? Let me recall, k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, that's interesting because the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is equal to k times some value. Let me compute ΔE/k.

ΔE = k * (something) --> 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * T -> wait, no, not exactly. Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. Oh, so ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back into our equation: ln(2) = (1 K) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ]

So that becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). That looks exactly like what we have here.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Yes, that's correct.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the ratio. The setup was that R1 = 2 R2. And R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

Wait, wait, when I take the ratio R1/R2, it's (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

So the equation is ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Which is (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

Since ΔE/k is 1 K, it's ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the degeneracies of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to unexcited states are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Dividing the two equations for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), the degeneracy factor \( \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \) cancels out, leaving:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}.
\]

Factoring out \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by option D.
