Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the decay of a boson X into fermions. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, the interaction term involves the boson X and some fermions. So, the term would probably be something like λ times the fermion fields, X, and maybe some Yukawa coupling? Wait, the question is about the decay of X into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the mass of X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find which fermions X can decay into, kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Okay, kinematic decay possibilities depend on the mass of the boson compared to the masses of the fermions it's decaying into. For a fermion pair, the combined mass has to be less than the mass of X. Also, considering that fermions come in different generations, each with their own masses.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions to see which are below 6 GeV.

Quarks:
- Up and down: very light, like a few MeV. So definitely below 6 GeV.
- Strange: around 100 MeV? No, wait, I think I'm mixing units. Let me get the approximate masses right. Wait, quark masses are usually given as current masses. Up and down are around 2-5 MeV, strange is about 100 MeV, up and down are way lighter, so their pairs will have masses much less than 6 GeV.
- Charm: around 1.5 GeV (since D mesons are about 1.8-2 GeV). So c quark is about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom: around 4.5-5 GeV. Some sources say around 4.7 GeV.
- Top quark is way too heavy, about 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks because X is only 6 GeV. So top is out.

Leptons:
- Electron: negligible mass, so e+ e- would be possible.
- Muon: about 0.1 GeV (105 MeV). So muon pair is possible.
- Tau: about 1.78 GeV. So tau+ tau- is possible.
- Neutrinos: very light, but since the problem is about X decaying into charged leptons, I think we can ignore neutrinos unless the question specifies.

Wait, but the problem talks about fermions in general, so it includes both quarks and leptons.

So the possible fermion pairs would be when the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But wait, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion must have a mass less than M_X / 2. Because each must have energy >= their rest mass. So for a fermion f, 2 m_f ≤ M_X.

So M_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

Let me list the masses:

Leptons:
- e: ~0.0005 GeV → way below 3 GeV.
- mu: ~0.105 GeV → below 3.
- tau: ~1.78 GeV → below 3.

Quarks (current masses):
- u: ~2 MeV → way below.
- d: ~5 MeV → same.
- s: ~95 MeV → same.
- c: ~1.27 GeV → below 3 GeV.
- b: ~4.5 GeV → wait, 4.5 is less than 6 but more than 3, so 2 m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 2*m_b would require M_X ≥9 GeV. Which isn't the case here.

Wait, but wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The sum of the masses of the two fermions must be less than 6 GeV. Because in the rest frame of X, the invariant mass is M_X. For decay into two particles, each must have m_i ≤ M_X / 2.

So for a pair like b bbar, each b is ~4.7 GeV. So 4.7 *2 is 9.4 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so it's impossible. So b quarks are out.

Similarly, top is way out. So the quarks that are allowed are u, d, s, c.

But wait, the X could decay into any of these quarks and their antiquarks, but let me check.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options include some possibilities. Let's look at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, as I said, b is too heavy. So option A includes b, which isn't possible. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c is about 1.27 GeV. 2c is 2.54 GeV <6 GeV. So c is allowed.

Tau is 1.78 GeV. 2tau is 3.56 GeV <6 GeV.

Mu is 0.105 GeV. 0.21 <6.

e is negligible. So all these are allowed.

But option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, but wait, what about the top quark's pair? No, top is way too heavy, so that's not in any of the options.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Oh, because the mass of the bottom is about 4.7 GeV, so 2 m_b would be ~9.4 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b bbar.

So in the options, option D is X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But because b is too heavy, that's not allowed. So options that include b are incorrect.

So looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is out. So A is incorrect.

Option B doesn't include b. So that's a possibility.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so C is out.

Option D includes b, which is wrong, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but what about the charm quark? 2m_c is about 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into c cbar.

So the allowed decays would be: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Which is option B.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. Let me think about what fermions are involved. The term is -λ f ψ̄f (v + X)ψf. So ψf represents the fermion fields. So the fermions in the interaction are f, which could be any fermion. So the decay products could be any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

So the possible decay channels are all possible fermion pairs where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV. So that includes all the up, down, strange, charm, and the charged leptons: e, mu, tau. But not bottom or top.

So the correct decay options are all of these except b and t, but the options don't include t. So which option has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e? That's option B.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". So the lowest order process is tree-level. So we need to consider whether the decay is possible through the given interaction term.

Wait, the interaction term is L = -λ f ψ̄f (v + X) ψf. Hmm, perhaps that's a Yukawa-like coupling. So the interaction would allow X to couple to any fermion f. So any fermion can be a decay product, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

So the possible decay products are any fermion with mass m <3 GeV.

So which fermions meet that?

Quarks:

u: m ~2 MeV <3 GeV → yes.

d: same as u.

s: ~100 MeV <3 GeV → yes.

c: ~1.27 GeV <3 → yes.

b: 4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no.

t: way higher, so no.

Leptons:

e, mu, tau: all have masses below 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the decay channels are X → f fbar for f = u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but the problem gives the options as in the options.

Looking back, option B is X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Which includes all these except b and t. So option B is correct.

But wait, the option B includes c, which is allowed. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The decay of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV into fermion-antifermion pairs depends on the kinematic condition that the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). For a boson decaying into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of each fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Allowance:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) — allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) — allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \) — allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) — not allowed, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) — not allowed, as \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
