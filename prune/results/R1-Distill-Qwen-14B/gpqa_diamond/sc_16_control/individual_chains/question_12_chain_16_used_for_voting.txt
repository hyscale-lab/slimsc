Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Let's see, the reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The question gives me the rest masses of the pion and the muon, but I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Hmm, wait, the pion is Pi(+) and it's at rest. So the initial momentum is zero since it's stationary. When it decays, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses (like, almost massless compared to the muon). I think in this problem, the neutrino's mass can be considered negligible. So I can probably treat it as a photon-like particle with no rest mass.

So, the total energy of the system before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, right? So the total energy is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon and neutrino share this energy. But the muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have just kinetic energy since its rest mass is almost zero.

Wait, but how do I split the energy between them? Oh, right, because momentum must be conserved. Initially, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, their momenta vectors cancel each other.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's momentum as also p in the opposite direction. But wait, since the neutrino's mass is almost zero, its energy is just pc. For the muon, which has a rest mass, its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), but since we're working in units where c=1 (because the masses are given in MeV/c² and energies in MeV), maybe I can ignore the c's for simplicity.

So, the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²). The neutrino's energy is p, since E = pc for massless particles.

The total energy is the sum of the two. So:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Wait, because the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So I can set up the equation:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Where m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

I need to solve for p. Let me rearrange this equation.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expand the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

So,

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 * p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 * p

Let me compute the squares:

105.7² is (approx) 105.7 * 105.7. Let's calculate:

105 * 105 = 11025. 0.7*105*2 = 147. (0.7)^2 is 0.49. So (105.7)^2 = approx (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2: let's calculate that.

140^2 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So putting it into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p

Let me rearrange:

2*139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Calculate the right side:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So,

2*139.6 * p = 8315.67

Compute 2*139.6 = 279.2

So,

279.2 * p = 8315.67

Divide both sides by 279.2:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that. 279.2 times 30 is 8376. So 30 is a bit more because 8376 is larger than 8315.67. Let me see:

279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should just do the division.

8315.67 / 279.2 = ?

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2: 8376 - 279.2= 8096.8. Hmm, wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me note that 279.2 * 30 = 8376. Which is higher than 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, which is 60.33 above 8315.67.

So 30 - (60.33 /279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do it step by step.

279.2 × 29 = 279.2 ×30 is 8376; minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But 279.2 × 29.784 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

Divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it easier: 83.1567 / 2.792.

Compute 83.1567 ÷ 2.792.

2.792 * 29.78 = let me compute 29.78 * 2.792.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 2.792 × 30 = 83.76. But 83.1567 is less than that.

The difference is 83.76 - 83.1567 = 0.6033. So 0.6033 / 2.792 ≈ 0.216.

So 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is p*c, which is 29.784 MeV (since E=pc for neutrino). But wait, the units are in MeV, so I think in these units, E is just p * c, but since c is 1 in energy-mass units, E = p.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In particle physics, energy is often in MeV, and mass is in MeV/c². So when you have E = pc for massless particles, the equation would be E = p c, but since we're working in units where c=1 (like natural units), E = p. So for the neutrino, E = p ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) which is sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784 squared: about (29.78)^2. Let me compute 30^2 =900, so 29.78 is 0.22 less than 30. (29.78)^2 = (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 ≈ 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.848.

So 29.784^2 ≈ (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.848.

m_mu is 105.7, so (105.7)^2 is 11172.49.

So sqrt(886.848 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.338) ≈ ?

Well, 110^2 is 12100. Oh, so sqrt(12059.338) is just under 110.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

Which is close to our value of 12059.338.

So the difference is 12059.338 - 12056.04 = 3.298.

So how much more than 109.8 is our sqrt?

Let me set x = 109.8 + delta.

x^2 = (109.8 + delta)^2 ≈ 109.8^2 + 2*109.8 * delta.

We have 109.8^2 = 12056.04.

We need x^2 = 12059.338.

So 2*109.8 * delta ≈ 12059.338 -12056.04 =3.298.

So delta ≈ 3.298 / (2*109.8) ≈ 3.298/(219.6) ≈ approx 0.015.

So x ≈ 109.8 + 0.015 = 109.815 MeV.

So the muon's energy is approximately 109.815 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is energy minus rest mass.

So KE_muon = 109.815 - 105.7 ≈ 4.115 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is p ≈ 29.784 MeV, which is all kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

So the KEs are approximately 4.115 MeV and 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option C is 3.52 and 20.8, which are way too low. Option B is 7.2 and 32.8; the neutrino's KE would be 32.8, but our calculation was about 29.8. Option A is 2.84 and 26.8; both are lower than our results.

So the correct option is D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)). The reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be equal. Initially, the energy is the rest energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Energy of the Neutrino:
For a massless particle like the neutrino, its energy is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon:
The muon, being massive, has total energy given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]

### Solving for \(p_{\mu}\) and \(p_{\nu}\):
From momentum conservation, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}.
\]

Let \(p = p_{\mu}\). The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]

Canceling \(p^2\) from both sides:
\[
(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]

Simplify and solve for \(p\):
\[
2(139.6)p = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.
\]

Compute the squares:
\[
(105.7)^2 = 11172.49, \quad (139.6)^2 = 19488.16.
\]

Substitute:
\[
2(139.6)p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2(139.6)} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon:
The muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Compute:
\[
(29.784)^2 \approx 886.85, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.815 - 105.7 \approx 4.115 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Kinetic Energies:
- \(KE_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\),
- \(KE_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Correct Option:
The closest match is **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).
