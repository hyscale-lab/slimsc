Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue and state vector. 

First, let me try to parse the information given. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z have their matrix forms provided. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the matrix representations are in the eigenbasis of P_z. So, for P_z, the eigenvectors are the basis vectors here. That makes sense because when an operator is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal, which is the case here for P_z.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The question is asking for the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator in question here, which is P_z.

So, to find ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then plug into the formula.

But wait, the state is given as a vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So, this state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might make things easier because if the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value is just the weighted average of the eigenvalues.

Hmm, let me think. The state ψ can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors, which are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the components of ψ are the coefficients (amplitudes) of each basis vector. Since the basis is orthonormal, the expectation value of P_z is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but looking at the matrix for P_z, it's diagonal. That's right, because in its own eigenbasis, P_z is diagonal. So the matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ] on the diagonal.

Wait, let me double-check. The P_z matrix has first row (ħ,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, each corresponding to their respective basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

In that case, the state ψ is a linear combination of |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩. The coefficients are the components of ψ: c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is c1|1⟩ + c2|2⟩ + c3|3⟩.

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, the expectation value, we can compute each term: each coefficient squared times the corresponding eigenvalue.

Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the sum of |c_i|² * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

So let's compute that.

First, compute |c1|², |c2|², |c3|².

c1 is -1/2. So |c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c2 is 1/√2. |c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c3 is -1/2. |c3|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Now, the eigenvalues of P_z are:

λ1 = ħ,

λ2 = 0,

λ3 = -ħ.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|² * λ1 + |c2|² * λ2 + |c3|² * λ3.

Plugging in:

= (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ)

= (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) 

= 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each eigenvalue. So P_z² is diagonal with entries [ (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 ] = [ ħ², 0, ħ² ].

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |c_i|² * (λ_i)^2.

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |c1|² * (λ1)^2 + |c2|² * (λ2)^2 + |c3|² * (λ3)^2

= (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²)

= (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) 

= ħ²/2.

So, now I have:

⟨P_z⟩ = 0,

⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ² / 2.

Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )

= sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 )

= sqrt( ħ² / 2 )

= (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, but since P_z and P_x don't commute, the uncertainty in P_z should be non-zero. Which it is, according to our calculation.

But let me make sure I did everything correctly. Let me recompute.

c1 = -1/2, so |c1|^2 is 1/4.

c3 is -1/2, same as c1, so |c3|^2 is 1/4.

c2 is 1/sqrt(2), |c2|^2 is 1/2.

So, when computing ⟨P_z⟩: (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4) = 0. That's correct.

⟨P_z²⟩: (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² = ( (1/4)+(1/4) ) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So sqrt( (1/2) ħ^2 ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2).

So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$, corresponding to the basis vectors. The coefficients of $\psi$ are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$, so the probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \lambda_1 + |c_2|^2 \lambda_2 + |c_3|^2 \lambda_3.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$, $\lambda_2^2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \lambda_1^2 + |c_2|^2 \lambda_2^2 + |c_3|^2 \lambda_3^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
