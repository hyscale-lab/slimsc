Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the problem again. There are two stars with the same mass, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet around them, both Neptune-like in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them. 

For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in response to the planet, and we detect that shift. So the velocity of the star is related to the planet's mass and orbit.

Wait, the formula for the Doppler shift or the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is important here. I think the formula for K is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(c)) , but I might be mixing it up.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(c)) * (2π / P) )^(1/3 )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the RV formula. Another approach is to remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period might play a role here.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the equation that connects the RV semi-amplitude (K) with the orbital period (P), the mass of the star (M), and the mass of the planet (m). Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, perhaps the ratio of their velocities can relate to the ratio of their orbital periods in some way.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is:

K = ( ( (G * (m_p) ) / ( (M + m_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P) ) ) / (c )

Wait, perhaps that's not the exact formula. Let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * c ) )

But since the eccentricity is zero (because the orbits are circular), the (1 - e²) term becomes 1. Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on) for maximum effect, so sin i is 1. So we can ignore those factors.

So, K = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p ] / [ (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * c ]

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, Sun is about 333,000 Earth masses), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c )

Rearranging, we can write:

K ∝ (P^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since both planets have the same mass (M_p is same for both planets), and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of K1 to K2 would depend on the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, but the question gives us the shift for each planet: planet 1 has a shift (K) of 5 milliangstroms, planet 2 has 7. So K1=5, K2=7.

But wait, no, the shifts are given as up to 5 and 7, but perhaps that's the semi-amplitude. So K1=5, K2=7?

Wait, no, the question says "the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom." So each star's spectral line shifts periodically, and the amplitude is 5 and 7.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

But since the stars are the same mass, and the planet masses are similar, M_p1 ≈ M_p2.

So, let's model this.

Given that for each planet:

K ∝ (P^(1/3)) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But M_p is same for both planets, M_star same for both stars.

So, K ∝ P^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P1^(1/3)) / (P2^(1/3)) )

But wait, wait. Because K is proportional to (P^(-1/3))? Wait, that's a point I might be getting mixed up.

Wait, let's think again. The formula I wrote earlier:

K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c )

So K is proportional to (P^(1/3)) * M_p / M_star^(2/3)

But since M_p and M_star are same for both, K is proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 = k * P1^(1/3)

K2 = k * P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K1 is proportional to P1^(1/3), and K2 is proportional to P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 = x * P1. We need to find x.

From the ratio:

K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) = (1/x)^(1/3).

But K1 is 5, K2 is 7; so K1/K2 = 5/7.

So,

(1/x)^(1/3) = 5/7

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(1/x) = (5/7)^3

So,

x = (7/5)^3

What's that number? 7^3=343, 5^3=125. So x=343/125 = approx 2.744.

Wait, but wait, that would mean P2 is about 2.74 times longer than P1.

But none of the options seem to match that. The options are A: ~0.36, B: ~1.40, C: ~1.96, D: ~0.85.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the proportionality. Because according to this, the answer would be about 2.74, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the proportionality. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I have the proportionality backwards. Let's re-express K.

From the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star^(2/3) c ) ) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3)

Wait, another approach. Let me write the formula correctly.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct formula. Let me get the correct formula.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i=1 (edge-on), which is the case here.

So,

K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

We can ignore M_p and M_star since they're the same for both planets.

So,

K ∝ ( (1/P ) )^(1/3 )

So,

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

Which implies that P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

Wait, no, because from K = constant * (1/P^(1/3)), so P = constant / K^3.

So, the period is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, P1 / P2 = (K2^3) / (K1^3 )

Because P1 = (constant)/(K1^3), P2 = (constant)/(K2^3), so P1/P2 = (K2^3)/(K1^3) )

Therefore,

P1/P2 = ( (7 / 5 ) )^3 = (1.4)^3 = 2.744.

Wait, but that's the same result as before. So P1 is 2.744 times P2. But wait, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1?

So, if P1 is 2.744 * P2, then P2 = P1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So, P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2 has a shorter period.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer but shorter, so perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, let me re-express. Let me think in terms of the equation.

We have:

K1 = 5 milliangstrom

K2 = 7 milliangstrom

K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe I should write it as K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3).

So,

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because K1 is smaller than K2, which would imply P2 is larger than P1.

Wait, let's re-express:

K1 = constant * (1/P1)^(1/3 )

K2 = constant * (1/P2)^(1/3 )

So,

K1 / K2 = (1/P1)^(1/3 ) / (1/P2)^(1/3 ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Taking both sides to the power of 3,

(K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Plugging in the numbers,

K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

(5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So,

P2 ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means planet #2's period is shorter, not longer.

But the question is asking: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

Since 0.36 is less than one, it's not longer; it's shorter. So the period is shorter.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let me re-express everything:

We have:

K1 = 5, K2 =7.

K1/K2 = 5/7 = 0.714.

From the formula, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So,

P2 = 0.364 * P1

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1?

Since 0.36 is less than 1, it's not longer, it's shorter. But the options don't have a negative sign, so perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), which would mean that if K increases, P decreases.

So, a larger K implies a shorter period. So, planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), so a shorter period.

So, the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since it's shorter, the ratio is less than one, so the answer is approximately 0.36 times. So the correct option is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.36

B) ~ 1.40

C) ~ 1.96

D) ~ 0.85

So, option A is the right one.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the question was phrased as "how many times longer is P2 than P1." But according to the calculation, P2 is shorter, so the ratio is less than 1, which is option A.

So the answer is A, 0.36 times.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 / P_1 \), we get:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \, P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is compared to \( P_1 \), and \( P_2 \) is shorter, the ratio is less than 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
