Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and their kinetic energy after a decay. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll think it through.

The problem says Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D.

Wait, right. Pi mesons are bosons, and they decay into other particles. Since the pion is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Oh, right, because the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But the neutrino has negligible mass, right? So its energy is approximately equal to its momentum. Hmm, but wait, in particle physics, neutrinos are considered as massless in many approximations, especially in problems like this. So maybe I can treat it that way.

So, the decay is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. So initial energy E_initial = m_pi c². But since we're working in units where c=1, E_initial = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV, and its energy will be E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² c² + m_mu² c^4). But again, c=1, so E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²).

The neutrino's energy E_nu is approximately p_nu c, but since c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Since momentum is conserved, the momenta must be equal and opposite. So p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

Set this equal to the initial energy: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Hmm, solving for p. Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me denote m_mu as 105.7 for simplicity.

So, sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Then, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2
p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p²

The p² terms cancel out on both sides.

So, m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu²
p = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi)

Let me compute that.

m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Compute m_pi squared: 139.6^2 = let's see, 140^2 is 19600, minus (0.4)^2 and some, but wait, maybe calculate it directly.

139.6 * 139.6: let's compute:

= (140 - 0.4)^2
= 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16
= 19600 - 112 is 19488; 19488 +0.16 is 19488.16.

m_mu squared: 105.7^2. Let's compute that.

105 *105 = 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross terms: 2*105*0.7 = 147. So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So,

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then, 2 m_pi = 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So,

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, let me approximate. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67.

So, 279.2 * 29.78 ≈ 8315.67? Let's see:

279.2 * 29.78 = ?

Wait, maybe a better approach. Let's calculate 8315.67 / 279.2.

First, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is 60.33 higher than 8315.67.

So subtract 60.33 from 8376 gives 8315.67. So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 = 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units here. Since we're working in MeV and c=1, the units are MeV/c.

So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Let's compute that.

p = 29.78, m_mu=105.7.

p^2 = (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.8.

m_mu squared is 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(12059.29). Let's compute 109^2 = 11881. 110^2 is 12100. So 109.8^2 is (109 + 0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04. Hmm, that's close to 12059.29.

So 109.8^2 is 12056.04. The target is 12059.29.

Difference is 12059.29 -12056.04=3.25.

So each 0.01 increment in x adds approximately 2*109.8*0.01=2.196 to x^2.

So, 3.25 / 2.196 ≈ 1.478 * 0.01=0.01478.

So, sqrt is approximately 109.8 + 0.01478≈109.8148 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.81 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is E - m c². Since the muon is the product, its kinetic energy is E_k_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

So E_k_mu=109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p =29.78 MeV. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy. So the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let's check the options.

Options are:

A) 2.84, 26.8

B)7.2,32.8

C)3.52,20.8

D)4.12,29.8

Hmm, our calculation for the muon's KE is 4.11 MeV, which is close to option D's first value, 4.12 MeV. The neutrino KE is 29.78, which rounds to 29.8 MeV, matching option D’s second value.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking back, the options for D are 4.12 and 29.8. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations. Let me quickly recalculate p.

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi )

m_pi^2 = 139.6^2=19488.16

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49

Difference:19488.16-11172.49=8315.67

Divide by 2 *139.6=279.2

8315.67 /279.2 = let me compute it more accurately.

279.2 × 29.78 = ?

279.2 ×29= 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 = 8376-279.2=8096.8.

279.2 ×0.78= let's compute 279.2 *0.7=195.44; 279.2 *0.08=22.336. Sum is 195.44+22.336=217.776.

So 279.2 ×29.78 = 279.2*(29+0.78)= (279.2*29) + (279.2*0.78)

Wait, I think I messed up that calculation earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

So 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, how many times does 279.2 go into 218.87? 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So total p is 29 + 0.783 = 29.783 MeV/c ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So, E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

E_mu is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29)=109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV. Rounded to 4.12, which is option D's first value. Neutrino's KE is 29.78, which rounds to 29.8.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. Thus, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}
\]

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
and the neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

Using conservation of energy:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \(p_{\mu^+}\)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p_{\mu^+}.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p_{\mu^+})^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p_{\mu^+} + p_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

Canceling \(p_{\mu^+}^2\) from both sides:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p_{\mu^+}.
\]

Rearranging for \(p_{\mu^+}\):
\[
2 m_{\pi^+} p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2,
\]
\[
p_{\mu^+} = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
p_{\mu^+} = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

Substituting \(p_{\mu^+} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu^+} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:
\[
K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
