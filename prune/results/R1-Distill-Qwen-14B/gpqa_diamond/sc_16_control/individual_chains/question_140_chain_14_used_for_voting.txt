Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the question. We're dealing with a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so for gas W, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. That makes me think of H2O, but wait, no. Wait, wait—water's molecule is H2O, which has 2 H's and one O. O has 8 protons. So, for H2O, each molecule has (2*(1 proton) + 8) protons, which is 10, and the neutrons would be 8 in O (since O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the most common isotope), and 1 each for H, but wait, maybe considering only the isotopes. Alternatively, maybe it's a different gas.

Wait, another possibility: CO2. Wait, but CO2 has each molecule with 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each). Neutrons in CO2 would be 6 (from C) and 16 each from O (if each O is O-16). So protons would be 6 + 16*2 = 38. Neutrons would be 6 + 16*2=38. Oh wait, that's the same number of protons and neutrons. So maybe gas W is CO2. But wait, wait, the reaction is violent, which makes me think of something explosive or a rapid reaction. Hmm, another thought: maybe the gas is H2O, but let's think about the numbers.

Wait, let's get back. The gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible molecules. For example, NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, H has 1 each) and 14 neutrons (N has 7-1=6? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of protons and neutrons in the entire molecule? Or each atom? No, the question says the molecule has same number. So the total protons in the molecule equals the total neutrons.

Let's think about small molecules. For example, H2O: each molecule has 2 H (each 1 proton) and one O (8). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: H is 1 (assuming protium), so each H has 0 neutrons. O has 8, so 8. So total neutrons: 8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not equal.

What about CH4? Protons: C (6) + 4 H (each 1) =10. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), each H has 0, so total neutrons 6. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe CO? C has 6, O has 8. So protons: 6+8=14. Neutrons: C (6) and O (8) → 6+8=14. So 14 each. So CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So W is CO? But does that make sense in the reaction?

Wait, but when I think about the reaction, it's a violent reaction between X and Y. Let me think of possible reactions. Maybe Y is an acid, or perhaps a base. Or perhaps Y is water? Not sure.

Wait, moving on, the reaction forms a precipitate G. When heated, G releases a substance B whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is close to the melting point of water (0 C) but wait, no, 277 K is about 4°C? Wait, 273 K is 0°C (water freezing), 277 is 4. So maybe B is something like solid CO2 (dry ice), but dry ice sublimates at -78°C. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe B is something with a higher melting point. Wait, let's think of another possibility.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH has a melting point of around 1150°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Wait, maybe it's ice? No, ice melts at 273 K (0°C). So 277 K is a bit higher, perhaps a type of ice or another solid. Alternatively, another compound. Wait, maybe B is sodium carbonate? Its melting point is around 850°C, which is way higher. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is some sort of oxide or another compound. Wait, another angle: perhaps when G is heated, it releases B, which is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. What solid has a melting point close to 4°C? Let me think. Maybe ammonium chloride? No, its melting point is around 337 K (64°C). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's sodium carbonate decahydrate, which has a melting point of about 277 K. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium bicarbonate. Let me check: Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) has a melting point around 270 K (about -4°C). Hmm, close but not exactly 277. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound. Wait, maybe B is a solid like NH4Cl, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. What could G be? Maybe a carbonate or sulfate. Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. If X is a heavy isotope-containing substance, maybe it's a metal or something else. Let's think of X as sodium because sodium is used in organic reactions as a reagent, like sodium metal (Na). Alternatively, perhaps it's potassium or another alkali metal.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, keto acids have a ketone group, which is a carbonyl group (C=O), but when they react with something, maybe they lose the carbonyl group or form another structure. Wait, if X is a metal like sodium, maybe it's a Grignard reagent? Or perhaps a Birch reduction? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, another angle: If X is a sodium isotope, like sodium-23 or sodium-25. Wait, but sodium's common isotope is Na-23 (atomic number 11, mass number 23). So, if X has a heavier isotope, perhaps it's Na-25 or something else. But wait, sodium only has a few isotopes, with Na-23 being the most abundant, then Na-24 and Na-25 in small amounts, and Na-26 is even more rare. But maybe X is not sodium but another element.

Wait, the problem says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Let's think about a keto acid, like cyclohexanone (which is a cyclic ketone, but wait, is it a keto acid? Or maybe something like acetoacetic acid, which is a keto acid. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. Then the reaction might be a condensation reaction. Wait, but the product has two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, where a keto acid loses CO2. But in that case, the product would have fewer O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The precipitate G when heated releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. So, what could G be? Maybe G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be the metal oxide, but if the metal is sodium, the oxide would be Na2O, which has a high melting point. Hmm, not matching 277 K.

Wait, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes when heated into sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O. So, if G is NaHCO3, then heating it would produce Na2CO3 (which has a melting point around 850°C, not 277 K). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G is something else. Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. If X is sodium (Na), and Y is water (H2O), the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. But in this case, the gas would be H2, not W. However, in the question, the gas is W, which is a molecule where protons equal neutrons. H2 has 2 H's, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So protons in W would be 2, neutrons 0. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. Let's think about Y as an acid, like sulfuric acid (H2SO4). But then X would react with it. Alternatively, perhaps Y is liquid nitrogen, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, let's think about the initial part again. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, perhaps X is an alkali metal, like sodium, but with a heavier isotope. For example, Na-25 (mass number 25) instead of Na-23.

Then, when X reacts with Y (maybe water), it produces gas W, which has same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Let's think about possible gases.

If W is CO (as I thought earlier), then CO has 14 protons (C:6, O:8) and 14 neutrons (C:6, O:8). So that fits. So, maybe the reaction is producing CO and another product.

Wait, but if X is sodium (Na), then reacting with what would produce CO? I'm not sure. Let me think of a reaction where sodium reacts with something to produce CO. Alternatively, maybe Y is carbon disulfide (CS2), but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is something else, like liquid NH3. If X is sodium metal, reacting with liquid NH3 might produce H2 gas, but not CO.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of another approach. Let's look at the possible options for the cumulative atomic masses in Substance X.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These numbers are atomic mass units. So, looking for two elements in X, the lightest and heaviest, and their cumulative masses.

Wait, for example, if X is Na (atomic mass ~23), then the heaviest isotope would be Na-25 or something else. But the cumulative atomic masses would be 23 (lightest) and 25 (heaviest), totaling 48, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two elements, like Na and something else. For example, maybe it's a salt, but that's unlikely because the question says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, which points to something like metals (Na, Mg, etc.) which are used as reducing agents.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a diatomic molecule, like Cl2, but that doesn't fit the heavier isotope part unless it's something like Cl-37 (heavier isotope of chlorine).

Wait, Cl has two common isotopes: Cl-35 (~75%) and Cl-37 (~25%). If X is Cl2, but in a form that includes more of the heavier isotope. Then, the elements in X are chlorine only. So the lightest element is Cl (35) and the heaviest is Cl (37). So cumulative would be 35 +37=72, which isn't an option. So that's not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound like NaOH? No, because NaOH is a base, but the question says X reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce gas W. Alternatively, X could be something like sodium carbonate, but that doesn't fit the heavier isotope part as much.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy water isotope, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, X is something like Br2, which has isotopes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G is formed. G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. What if G is a carbonate, and B is CO2? But CO2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product of a keto acid and X containing 2 O atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which has a structure like CH3-C(O)-CH2-COOH. When it reacts with X, which is a base, perhaps it undergoes a condensation or decarboxylation. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and the reaction forms a metal salt of the keto acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if the keto acid loses a COOH group and becomes a ketone. But a ketone has one O in the carbonyl group. Wait, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, maybe it's a diketone? Or maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something else with two O-containing groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen condensation, where a keto acid forms a β-keto ester or something similar. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ester or something else. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to relate this to the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Looking for two elements in X, their lightest and heaviest isotopes, summed.

Wait, if X is sodium (Na), atomic number 11, the lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass 23), and the heaviest is Na-25 (mass 25). So 23 +25=48 → not an option.

If X is magnesium (Mg), which has isotopes Mg-24 (24), Mg-25 (25), Mg-26 (26). So lightest is 24, heaviest 26 → 50, not an option.

If X is aluminum (Al), which has isotopes around mass 27, but others like 26 and 28. So 26 +28=54, not an option.

Wait, what about something like potassium (K)? It has isotopes like K-39, K-41. Lightest is 39, heaviest 41 → 80, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X isn't a metal but a compound. Let's think of X as something like NH3 (but that's not a reagent in the same way). Alternatively, if X is something like NaH, which is a strong base. But NaH has Na and H. Lightest isotopes: H is 1, Na is 23. Heaviest: H is 1 (since H's heavier isotopes are rare), Na could be 25. So 1 +25=26, not in options.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule of a heavier isotope. For example, if X is O2, but O has isotopes like O-16, O-18. But O's atomic number is 8. So lightest is 16, heaviest 18 → 34, not an option.

Wait, what about X being carbon? Carbon has isotopes like C-12, C-13, C-14. So lightest 12, heaviest 14 → sum 26, not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing two different elements. For example, Na and O. Suppose X is NaO, but that's not a common compound. Alternatively, maybe X is Na2O, which is sodium oxide.

Wait, sodium oxide (Na2O) has Na and O. The lightest isotopes: Na-23, O-16. Heaviest isotopes: Na-25, O-18. So sum would be (23 +16) [lightest] and (25 +18) [heaviest] → but wait, the question says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes present. Wait, the question states: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps I misread that. The question says, for each element in X, sum all its isotopes (heavier and lighter) and then add the sums for the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Wait, no, wait. It says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, for each element in X, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and then add those sums for the lightest and heaviest elements.

Hmm. So for example, if X has two elements, A and B. Element A's lightest isotope is 1, heaviest is 10. Element B's lightest is 2, heaviest is 15. So cumulative would be (1 +10) + (2 +15) = 28.

Wait, but the options are 25,29, etc. So let's think of possible elements.

Suppose X contains Na (element 11) and Cl (element 17). Na's lightest is 23, heaviest 25. Cl's lightest is 35, heaviest 37. So the lightest element is Na (11 <17), heaviest is Cl (17>11). So sum Na's lightest and heaviest: 23 +25=48. Sum Cl's: 35 +37=72. Total would be 48 +72=120, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: X contains H and O. H's lightest is 1, heaviest (if considering deuterium) is 2. O's lightest is 16, heaviest 18. So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (8). Sum H's:1+2=3. O's:16+18=34. Total 3+34=37, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of a single element with isotopes. For example, H2. H's lightest is 1, heaviest 3 (tritium). So sum would be 1 +3 =4. But that's for the same element, so the only element present. So cumulative would be 4. Not matching the options.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with two elements where the heaviest is Cl (35 and 37) and the lightest is Na (23 and 25). Wait, but that brings us back to the earlier sum.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. It contains N (14 and 15) and H (1 and 2). So, lightest element is H, heaviest N. Sum H:1+2=3. Sum N:14+15=29. So total 3+29=32, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the options. The options are 25,29,31,35.

Wait, option B is 25. How can we get 25 as the cumulative sum?

If X contains elements where the lightest is C (12) and the heaviest is something else. Wait, 25. Could it be 12 (C's lightest) and 13 (C's heaviest, since C has C-13 as a stable isotope? No, C's isotopes are up to C-14, but C-14 is not stable. Wait, but isotopes are considered regardless of stability. So C's isotopes go up to C-14.

Wait, if X has only carbon, then the lightest and heaviest would both be C. So sum would be (12 +14) =26. Not in options.

Wait, another possibility: X contains Li (lightest) and something else. Li has isotopes Li-6 and Li-7. So sum Li:6 +7=13. If the other element is, say, O, sum O's:16 +18=34. So total 13+34=47, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X contains O and F. O's sum is 16+18=34. F's sum is 19 +21=40. So lightest is O (8) and F (9), so O is lighter, so sum would be (34) + (19+21=40) → 34+40=74. No.

Wait, perhaps X contains H and F. H sum 1+2=3. F sum 19+21=40. So 3+40=43. No.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains C and O. C sum 12+14=26. O sum 16+18=34. So 26+34=60. No.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the reaction again.

If X is sodium, and Y is water, then the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So W is H2. But in this case, W's molecule (H2) has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So protons=2, neutrons=0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit the condition that protons=neutrons.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate. If X is sodium and Y is a carbonate solution, the reaction might produce CO2 gas. Wait, but sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) would react with something else. Alternatively, perhaps if Y is a carbonate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps W is CO. So, the reaction produces CO. Let me think about a reaction that produces CO. Maybe the reaction between a metal and a carbonate. For example, perhaps X is sodium reacting with a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of sodium bicarbonate, and X is something else. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium. So X could be D2O (heavy water). But then Y would react with it. Let's think: if Y is an acid, maybe H2SO4, then the reaction would produce SO2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy water isotope, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a halogen with a heavier isotope, like Cl-37. Then, Y could be something like sodium hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between X (a metal) and Y (a salt) produces a gas. For example, if Y is a lead nitrate solution, and X is potassium, the reaction might produce KNO3 and lead metal, but I'm not sure about the gas.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Mg, which reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce H2 gas. But again, the gas would be H2, which doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the gas W which has protons equal to neutrons. Let's list possible gases.

Possible gases where total protons = total neutrons in the molecule.

- CO: C has 6 protons, O has 8 → total 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 → total 14. So yes, CO fits.

- N2: Each N has 7 protons. So 14 protons. Neutrons: Each N has 7 (if N-14), so 14. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's another possibility.

- O2: Each O has 8 protons. So 16 protons. Neutrons: O-16 has 8 each. So 16. 16=16. So O2 is another possibility.

So possible W could be CO, N2, O2.

Now, considering the reaction.

If W is O2, then the reaction could be the decomposition of something. But O2 is a product when something oxidizes, but perhaps in a reaction between a metal and an acid, O2 might be a product in some cases, but I'm not sure.

If W is N2, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an ammonium salt, releasing N2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if W is CO, then the reaction might involve the reduction of a carbonate or something similar.

Wait, let's think of a reaction between sodium (X) and a carbonate (Y). Sodium reacts with a carbonate to produce sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2? Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between sodium and a metal carbonate, which produces the metal, CO2, and sodium carbonate. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and X is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think about a keto acid reacting with sodium metal. Acetoacetic acid, for example, when treated with a base like NaOH, undergoes a condensation reaction to form a β-keto ester. But I'm not sure about the exact product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. For example, when a keto acid like acetoacetic acid is heated with a base, it loses CO2 and forms a ketone. So the product would be a ketone, which has one O in the carbonyl group. But the product is supposed to have two O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, which has two carbonyl groups. So the product would have two O atoms. That could fit.

So, if X is sodium, and the reaction is with a keto acid to form a diketone, then the product has two O atoms. That makes sense.

So, putting it all together: X is sodium (or a sodium isotope), which reacts with Y (maybe a keto acid) to form a diketone (product with two O atoms). The reaction also produces gas W (maybe CO or N2).

Now, looking back, when X reacts with Y (liquid), it releases gas W (CO or N2) and forms precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

If W is CO, then perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, if W is N2, perhaps the reaction is between sodium and an ammonium salt, releasing N2 gas.

Wait, sodium reacting with NH4Cl (ammonium chloride) might produce NaCl, NH3, and H2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between sodium and a nitride, producing Na3N or something else, releasing N2.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to focus on the elements in X. If X is sodium, then the elements present are only Na. So the lightest and heaviest elements in X are both Na, so the cumulative would be (23 +25) =48, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe X isn't sodium but another element. Let's think of the options.

Wait, the options for the cumulative sum are 25,29,31,35.

Looking for two elements in X where the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes is one of these numbers.

If X contains two elements, say, C and O. Lightest is C, heaviest O.

C's lightest is 12, heaviest 14 (if considering C-14). O's lightest is 16, heaviest 18.

Sum would be (12+14) + (16+18)=26+34=60. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X contains H and Cl. H's sum 1+2=3. Cl's sum 35+37=72. 3+72=75. Not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps X contains elements where the lightest and heaviest have sums that match the options. For example, if the lightest has sum 23, heaviest 2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, let's think of each option.

Option B is 25. How can we get 25?

If the lightest element has sum 1+2=3 (H and D) and the heaviest has sum 22 (which would be 22, but what element has isotopes summing to 22? Maybe magnesium-24 and Mg-20? No, Mg's isotopes are 24,25,26. So Mg's sum would be 24+26=50. Not 22.

Wait, perhaps the lightest element sum is 12 (C-12) and the heaviest is 13 (C-13), sum 25. So if X contains only C, then (12+13)=25, which would make the cumulative sum 25. But the question says 'the lightest and heaviest elements present within X', which would be the same element, so that's possible. If X is carbon-based, then the sum would be 25.

Wait, but the problem says that X is a reagent in organic chemistry. So X could be something like carbon, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing C and another element with a heavier isotope.

Wait, another possibility: X is a carbon isotope compound, like graphite or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule containing both C and H, where C's isotopes sum to 12+14=26, and H's sum 1+2=3. So total would be 26+3=29, which is option D. So 29 would be the sum.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

If X contains C and H, the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is C (6). So sum H's isotopes: 1 +2=3. Sum C's isotopes:12 +14=26. So total 3+26=29 → option D.

But the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So if X has C and H, perhaps one of them has a heavier isotope. For example, X could be CH3Cl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where C is present as a heavier isotope, like C-14.

Wait, but regardless, the cumulative sum would be 29, which is option D.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like CO2, which has C and O. So, the lightest element is C (sum 12+14=26), heaviest O (16+18=34). So sum 26+34=60, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X contains H and O. H's sum 3, O's sum34. So total 37, not an option.

Wait, if X contains Li (sum 6+7=13) and something else. If the other element is F (sum 19+21=40), total 53. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible options and see which could fit.

If the answer is option B (25), then maybe the lightest element's isotopes sum to 12 (C) and the heaviest is 13 (C), sum 25. So X is carbon-based, perhaps.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the answer is option C (31), perhaps the lightest is 14 (N) and the heaviest 17 (O), but that doesn't add up. Wait, 14+17=31. So, if X contains N and O, and the lightest is N (sum 14 (N-14) and N-15: 14+15=29). O's sum 16+18=34. So 29+34=63. No.

Wait, maybe the lightest is 14 (N), heaviest is 17 (O), but 14+17=31. So if X contains N and O, the sum would be 14+17=31. But wait, the question says the cumulative sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' isotopes. So, if X has N and O, lightest is N (14), heaviest O (16+18=34). So sum N's: 14+15=29. Sum O's:16+18=34. So 29+34=63. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains only one element, whose lightest and heaviest isotopes sum to 25. So the element must have a lightest isotope of 12 and heaviest of 13 (like carbon). Because 12+13=25. So X is carbon-based, and the sum is 25. So option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. For example, if X is a carbon isotope compound, like graphite, then the sum would be 25.

So putting it all together, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, considering isotopes. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releases gas W (where the molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons), and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, a substance with a melting point near 277 K. Additionally, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO (14 protons, 14 neutrons), N₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons), or O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons). These gases could plausibly result from the reaction between X and Y.

2. **Precipitate G and Substance B**: G is a precipitate formed during the reaction, and when heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be a compound like ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), though exact identification is unclear.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X reacts with the keto acid to form a compound with two oxygen atoms, possibly a diketone or a related structure.

4. **Isotopic Analysis of X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be calculated. The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35.

   - If X contains **carbon (C)**, its lightest isotope is C-12 (mass 12), and its heaviest is C-14 (mass 14). The sum of these isotopes is 12 + 14 = 26. However, this does not match the options.
   - If X contains **hydrogen (H)** and **carbon (C)**, the lightest element is H (1 + 2 = 3), and the heaviest is C (12 + 14 = 26). The cumulative sum is 3 + 26 = 29, which matches **Option D**.
   - If X contains **oxygen (O)**, its lightest isotope is O-16 (16), and its heaviest is O-18 (18). The sum is 16 + 18 = 34, which does not match the options.

5. **Final Consideration**: The most plausible scenario is that X contains **hydrogen (H)** and **carbon (C)**. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H: 1 + 2 = 3) and heaviest (C: 12 + 14 = 26) elements sum to 29, corresponding to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 29.
