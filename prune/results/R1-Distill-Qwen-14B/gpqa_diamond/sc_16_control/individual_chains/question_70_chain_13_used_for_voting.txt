Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reactions step by step.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember from my notes that when a metal reacts with a halogen, especially like sulfur reacting with something, maybe it forms a compound with a certain stoichiometry. Wait, sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl) react in a 1:4 ratio to form sulfur tetrachloride? Or wait, no, maybe it's sulfur trioxide or something else. Oh! Wait, another thought: could it be something like phosphorus reacting with chlorine? Phosphorus (P) has valency 5, and if it reacts with Cl2, maybe it's PCl5? Because when I think about the color, phosphorus pentachloride is a bright yellow crystalline solid, but wait the product here is bright red. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait another point: C reacts with two equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Oh, I remember that when something reacts with chlorine (Cl2) or maybe another gas. Wait, D is a gas, so maybe D is Cl2. Let me think: if C is PCl5, reacting with Cl2... No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is SO3 or another compound.

Wait, moving on to the next part. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in the presence of water, it hydrolyzes into A, which is the original solid, and two acids. One is strong, the other weak. Let me think about that. For instance, if C is SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO4 and maybe something else. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but another product? Wait, SO3 + H2O can go to H2SO4, which is a strong acid, but that's only one acid. Oh, perhaps C is something else.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a nitride or a sulfide? No, maybe not. Let's think of a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. For example, if C is a metal chloride—wait, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the first reaction. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. The stoichiometry is 1:8. That's a high ratio. Hmm, wait, perhaps A is carbon and B is fluorine? Carbon reacts with excess fluorine to form carbon tetrafluoride (CF4), but that's 1:4. No, maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na) reacting with chlorine (Cl2) but the stoichiometry would be 2 moles of Cl2 to get 2NaCl, which is 1:1 ratio. Hmm, but that's not matching 8 equivalents.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the third reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. H is a solvent, so possible candidates are like HCl (but HCl is a gas), maybe H2O? No, because B and D are gases. Wait, D and B are both gases and when they react 1:1, they form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water (but H2O is a liquid), maybe something like HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, perhaps D is H2 and B is Cl2? No, H2 and Cl2 react to form HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Wait, another thought: What if H is NH3? Because D and B could be H2 and N2? No, that's the Haber process, but that's 3 H2 and 1 N2 to form 2 NH3. But the problem says a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, going back. The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form product E (extremely hazardous). If E is something like phosgene, which is COCl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should start by identifying the compounds. Let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms product C. Let's think about possible compounds. One possibility is that A is phosphorus (P), which reacts with Cl2 (B) in a 1:8 ratio. Wait, phosphorus has 5 valence electrons. Each Cl would take one electron. So, P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. The reaction would be P (solid) + 5 Cl2 (gas) → PCl5 (solid). Wait, but 5 equivalents, not 8. Hmm. So that may not fit. Or maybe it's another element.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur (S) has 6 valence electrons. If it reacts with Cl2, perhaps it forms SCl4? Wait, but the reaction would be S + 2Cl2 → SCl2, but that's for a 1:2 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps S reacts with excess Cl2 to form SCl6, but I'm not sure if that exists. Or maybe it's another compound.

Wait, another angle: the product C, when reacted with water, produces A plus two acids. So, for example, if C is SO3, then the reaction with water would be SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. But that's only one acid. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like N3^-? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal chloride. Suppose C is AlCl3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to form Al(OH)3 and HCl. But Al(OH)3 is a weak acid (well, it's amphoteric, but in solution, it can act as an acid). But in that case, F and G would be HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (which might not be an acid but more of a base). Hmm, not quite matching.

Wait, let's think about silicon tetrafluoride, SiF4. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce HF (strong acid) and H2SiO3 (which is a weak acid, since it's similar to silicic acid). So SiF4 + 2 H2O → H2SiO3 + 4 HF. But in the problem, two equivalents of D are used. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the third reaction. D and B in a 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. So, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, but their reaction in 1:1 would be Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, D could be H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Oh, wait, another thought: perhaps H is something like H2O, but that would require D and B to form H2O. Like, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But in that case, the ratio is 1:1 (since 2 H2 and 1 O2 are in 2:1 ratio). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe H is something else. Another solvent is ethanol, but that's a liquid. Maybe H is something like CHCl3, but that's not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is a diatomic molecule, but that's not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the possible products and their properties. Wait, let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. What's a compound that is very dangerous when formed from another compound reacting with a gas? Maybe phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene is formed by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with water, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, another possibility: If C is PCl5, and D is something else. Let's think: When PCl5 is reacted with something, perhaps it forms POCl3 or another compound. Alternatively, maybe D is O2, but not sure.

Wait, maybe D is O2. Then, C could be something like SO2. SO2 reacting with O2 in the presence of a catalyst could form SO3, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O7, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3, and D is CO. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. Let me recall what these symmetry groups represent.

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h is the dihedral group with four-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. D∞h would be an infinite dihedral group, which is the symmetry of a linear molecule with a center of inversion and a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis. C2v is a two-fold rotation and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, so which of these would correspond to a particular molecule? For example, O2 has a dihedral symmetry, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the possible structure of E.

If E is a molecule with a linear structure, like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, O2 has a dihedral symmetry, but O2 is diatomic, so its symmetry is D∞h as well. Wait, no. O2 is a diatomic molecule with a D∞h symmetry because it's linear and has a center of inversion and mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.

But wait, another possibility: if E is Cl2O7, which is chlorine heptoxide. It has the formula Cl-O-Cl, but I'm not sure of its structure. Alternatively, if E is something else.

Wait, considering the reaction steps, let's try to piece together the compounds.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Possible that A is S (sulfur), B is O2. Then, 8 equivalents would be 4 O2 (since each O2 molecule is 2 atoms, so 4 molecules give 8 atoms). Wait, but sulfur plus O2 would form SO3? Let me check: S + O2 → SO3. The reaction is 1 S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. Hmm, that doesn't fit 8 equivalents of O2. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another approach: The reaction of A with 8 equivalents of B produces C. Let's think in terms of moles. So, if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. So, perhaps A is a metal with a +2 charge reacting with a diatomic gas. For example, Mg (Mg is +2) reacting with Cl2. Mg would need 1 mole of Cl2 for each mole of Mg, because MgCl2 is formed. So Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2. The stoichiometry is 1 Mg : 1 Cl2. But that's only 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Mg. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but the question says 8 equivalents of gas B. So, perhaps for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are consumed. Let's think of A as Fe and B as Cl2. Fe has a valency of +2 or +3. If it's Fe^3+, then FeCl3 would form. The reaction would be 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So for 2 Fe, 3 Cl2 are used. That's 1.5 equivalents per Fe. Not quite 8.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Let me think of carbon. If A is C and B is F2. Then, C reacts with F2 to form CF4. The reaction is C + 2 F2 → CF4. So for each C, 2 F2 are used. That's 4 equivalents (since 2 molecules, each F2 is 2 atoms, so 4 F atoms). Not 8.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is P, and B is Cl2. As I thought earlier, P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. The reaction is P + 5 Cl2 → PCl5. So for each P, 5 Cl2 are used. That's 10 equivalents. But the problem says 8. Hmm, not matching. Maybe another scenario.

Alternatively, S (sulfur) reacts with Cl2 to form SCl4. The reaction would be S + 2 Cl2 → SCl2. But that's 4 equivalents. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal with a higher valency. Let's say A is Zn (Zn^2+). Reacting with Cl2: Zn + Cl2 → ZnCl2. The stoichiometry is 1 Zn : 1 Cl2 → 2 equivalents. So not 8.

Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's try to think about product E. It's a result of C reacting with 2 equivalents of D. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B would be H2 and N2. But their reaction is in a 1:1 ratio, but the Haber process uses 3 H2 and 1 N2 → 2 NH3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, H could be H2O. Then, D and B would be O2 and H2. The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 1:1 ratio of H2 and O2 (since 2 H2 and 1 O2 → 2 H2O). So D is H2 and B is O2. So in the third reaction, H2 and O2 react in 1:1 ratio (by moles) to form H2O, which is a solvent.

Wait, that makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2, and H is H2O.

Now, going back to the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. B is O2. So A plus 8 O2 → C. What solid reacts with O2 in a 1:8 ratio? Hmm, perhaps A is phosphorus (P). The reaction of P with O2 is P + O2 → P oxides.

Phosphorus typically forms P4O10 when burned in excess oxygen. The reaction is 4 P + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. Wait, that's 4 P and 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. So per P atom, 5/4 O2 is used. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of O2 per A. So maybe A is P, and the product is P4O10? Let me check the reaction.

P4 reacts with O2 to form P4O10.

The reaction is P4 + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. Hmm, but that's not producing P4O10. Wait, no, P4O10 is formed via:

P4 + O2 → P4O10. The stoichiometry would be P4 + 5 O2 → P4O10. So for each mole of P4, 5 moles O2 are consumed. 5 * 2 = 10 atoms of O. So for each P4 molecule (which has 4 P atoms), 5 O2 molecules (10 O atoms) are used. So per P atom, (5 * 2) /4 = 2.5 O2 molecules per P.

But the problem states that A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2. So per mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are used. Let's see: if A is P, then 1 P atom would require 2.5 O2 molecules. So 4 P atoms (P4) would require 10 O2 molecules. Wait, 10 O2 is 20 O atoms. Hmm, but P4O10 has 4 P and 10 O, so each P atom has 2.5 O atoms attached. So the total O2 used per P4 is 5 moles (since 5 O2 → 10 O atoms).

So in the problem, 8 equivalents of O2 are used. So per mole of A (which is P?), 8 O2 are consumed. So for P4, that would be 4 P atoms → 5 O2 → 10 O. But 8 O2 is 16 O atoms. Hmm, not matching up. Alternatively, maybe the product is something else.

Wait, perhaps A is carbon. Carbon reacting with O2 can form CO or CO2. For example, 2 C + 3 O2 → 2 CO2. So per C, 1.5 O2 are used. But the problem says 8 equivalents. So 1 C → 8 O2. That would imply a formula like C O8? Not sure if that exists. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal like sodium.

Wait, if A is sodium (Na), which has a valency of +1. Reacting with O2 would form Na2O or NaO2? NaO2 is sodium monoxide, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, Na reacts with O2 to form Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). The reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. So per mole of Na2O2, 1 mole O2 is used. So for 2 moles Na, 1 mole O2. If A is Na, then per mole of Na, 0.5 moles O2 are used. But the problem says 8 equivalents of O2, so 8 moles O2 per mole A. That would imply A is something else.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal with a high oxidation state. Let me think of iron(III) oxide, but that's a product, not a reactant.

Wait, maybe the product C is SO3. Then, the reaction of S (solid) with O2 (gas) would form SO3. Let me think: S + O2 → SO3. The balanced equation is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. Wait, per S atom, 3 O2 are used. So for each mole of S, 3 moles of O2 are used. That's 6 equivalents. But the problem says 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product C is not a metal oxide but something else. Let me try another approach.

C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C could be a metal sulfide or a metal chloride. For instance, if C is AlCl3, then hydrolysis would give Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric) and HCl. HCl is strong, so F is HCl. Al(OH)3 can act as a weak acid, but I'm not sure if that's considered a weak acid in this context. Alternatively, if C is Na2SO3, hydrolysis would give NaOH and H2SO3 (which is weak), but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is SO3. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But that's only one acid. So perhaps C is something else.

Wait, if C is PCl5, then hydrolysis would give HCl (strong acid) and H3PO4 (which is a weak acid). So the reaction would be PCl5 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 5 HCl. So in this case, F is HCl (strong acid), G is H3PO4 (weak acid). That fits. So product C is PCl5.

So, putting this together:

A is P (phosphorus), B is Cl2 (since product C is PCl5). So the first reaction would be P + 5 Cl2 → PCl5. Wait, that's 5 equivalents of Cl2 per P. But the problem says 8 equivalents. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction's stoichiometry is 1 A + 8 B → C. So, for example, if A is P, and B is Cl2, the reaction is P + 5 Cl2 → PCl5, which uses 5 equivalents, but the problem says 8. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the formula of C is different. If C is PC l3? Then the reaction would be P + 3 Cl2 → PC l3. That uses 3 equivalents, but the problem says 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is elemental sulfur. Then, sulfur (S) with O2 forms SO3. The reaction is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. So for 1 S, 3 O2 are used (6 equivalents). But the problem says 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different gas, like F2. So, A is something that reacts with 8 F2. For example, if A is O, then O + 4 F2 → 2 OF2. That's 4 equivalents. Not 8.

Wait, maybe A is a diatomic molecule. Let's say A is N2. Reacting with F2: N2 + 4 F2 → 2 NF3. So that's 4 equivalents. Not 8.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first reaction. Let me try to think of the other reactions first.

C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E. If D is H2, then 2 moles of H2 reacting with C. Hmm, but earlier I thought D was H2, as in the third reaction, D (H2) and B (O2) react to form H2O.

So, if C is PCl5 and D is H2, then what's the reaction? PCl5 + H2 → ?

Wait, PCl5 can react with H2O to produce H3PO4 and HCl, but H2 is a different reactant. Alternatively, perhaps C is PCl5 and D is H2, which might produce PH3 or something else. But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something that reacts with H2 in another way. For example, SO3 reacting with H2 to form something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene (O=CCl2) is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure of its synthesis. Maybe E is sarin, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O7, which is chlorine heptoxide, a highly oxidizing and dangerous compound. Cl2O7 is formed when Cl2 reacts with oxygen, but that's another scenario.

Wait, perhaps C is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3 or ClF5, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of E's molecular structure. Let me think about the options for E. If E is a linear molecule, like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. Or O2, which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. Another possibility is Cl2O, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry.

Wait, but if E is Cl2O, then its structure is bent, like water, with a bond angle around 119 degrees, so its symmetry group would be C2v, which is one of the options.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a symmetry group of C2v. Ozone has a central O atom with two O atoms attached, so its point group is C2v.

Wait, but Ozone is O3. Its structure is bent, and its point group is D3h, but I might be getting that wrong. Wait, no, O3 has a central oxygen double-bonded to one O and single-bonded to another, making it a bent structure. The symmetry elements would include a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecule and two mirror planes. So the point group is D3h? Or maybe C2v.

I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a linear molecule. Its structure is O=C=Cl2? Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule with a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So it's a trigonal planar structure, which would have D3h symmetry. But phosgene is a gas, so that might fit.

Alternatively, another possibility is that E is a diatomic molecule. Let's say E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, its point group would be D∞h, which is one of the options.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to tie everything together.

Earlier, I thought that D is H2 and B is O2, as they form H2O. So in the third reaction, H2 and O2 react to form H2O, which is a solvent.

In the first reaction, A reacts with 8 B (O2) to form C. If A is P, then the reaction would be P + 5 O2 → PCl5? No, because O2 is B, but earlier I thought B is Cl2. Wait, no. In this scenario, B is O2, so perhaps C is P4O10.

Wait, if B is O2, then the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So let's say A is P. The reaction would be 4 P + 10 O2 → 2 P2O5. But wait, the stoichiometry is 4 P : 10 O2 → 2 P2O5. So per mole of P, 2.5 O2 are used. That's 2.5 equivalents per P. But the problem states 8 equivalents of O2 are used per A. So 1 mole of A uses 8 moles of O2. So if A is P, that would require 8 O2 per P. So 1 P + 8 O2 → product C.

Hmm, but I don't know of such a compound. P typically forms P2O5, which uses 5 O2 per 2 P. So per P, 2.5 O2 used. Not 8.

Wait, another possibility: A is carbon. So C reacts with 8 O2. The reaction would be C + 8 O2 → something. Wait, but that's a lot of O2. Maybe forming CO2? The reaction is C + O2 → CO2. For each C, 1 O2 is consumed. Not 8.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think of E's structure again. If E is O3, its symmetry group is C2v. If E is Cl2O, which is a bent molecule, its symmetry group would be C2v. So looking at the options, option D is C2v.

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2, its symmetry group is D∞h. So option C is D∞h.

Wait, but I'm not certain about E's identity. Let me try to think of another approach.

Perhaps, when C reacts with D to form E, D is H2. So, what reaction could C have with H2 to form E? If C is PCl5, then reacting with H2 might produce PH3 and HCl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3. SO3 reacting with H2 might produce something else, but I don't know.

Wait, another possibility: If C is SO3 and D is H2, the reaction could be SO3 + H2 → H2SO3 (which is weak acid) and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O7. Cl2O7 is a strong oxidizing agent. It can decompose or react in various ways, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: since C reacts with water to produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak), and D is H2. So D is H2. Then, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 H2 → E.

If C is PCl5, then reaction with H2 might produce PH3 and HCl, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3, which reacts with H2 to form H2S and something else, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the possible symmetry groups.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, C2v. If it's a tetrahedral structure, Td, etc.

But the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Another thought: What if E is H2O? No, because H2O is a solvent, and the third reaction produces H as the solvent. So E must be something else.

Wait, perhaps E is ClO2. Chlorine dioxide is a greenish-yellow gas. Its structure is bent, with a Cl-O-Cl arrangement, but I'm not sure of its symmetry group. Wait, ClO2 has a bent structure with a central oxygen, so its point group would be C2v.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3, which has a bent structure and a point group of D3h. But D3h isn't one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's C2v.

Wait, based on the options, the possible correct answers are D4h, D∞h, C2, or C2v.

If E is O2, then D∞h.

If E is O3, then D3h, which isn't an option.

If E is Cl2O, then C2v.

If E is CO2, then D∞h.

But how do I tie this back to the reactions?

Wait, if C is PCl5, and D is H2, then reacting C with H2 would produce PH3 and HCl? Or perhaps E is PHCl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If C is PCl5, and D is O2, but that's B, so D can't be O2 because B is O2 in this scenario.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of E as H2O. No, because H2O is the solvent in the third reaction.

Wait, perhaps E is Cl2O, which is an extremely hazardous compound. Cl2O is a yellowish-green gas. Its structure is bent with a bond angle around 119 degrees, similar to water. So its point group would be C2v.

So, putting it all together:

A is P (phosphorus), B is O2, D is H2. Reaction 1: P + 5 O2 → PCl5? Wait, no. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, earlier I thought B is O2 and D is H2. So in the first reaction, A + 8 O2 → C. Let's think of C as P4O10. The reaction would be 4 P + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5? No, wait that's 4 P and 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. So per mole of P4 (4 P), 5 O2 are used. That's 10 O atoms per 4 P. So per P atom, 2.5 O2 are used. But the problem says 8 O2 per A. So if A is a single P atom, 8 O2 would be consumed. That would require a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with high valency, like chromium. Chromium can form CrO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is iron, and B is O2. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO. The reaction is 2 Fe + O2 → 2 FeO. So per Fe, 0.5 O2 used. Not 8.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal with a lower valency. For example, magnesium reacting with O2 to form MgO. The reaction is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. So per Mg, 0.5 O2 used. Still not 8.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first reaction. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

If E is Cl2O, which has a C2v point group, then the answer would be D) C2v.

Alternatively, if E is O2, the point group is D∞h, which is option C.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: I've read that phosgene (O=CCl2) has a point group of D3h, which isn't an option here. So perhaps it's not that.

Wait, the options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If the correct answer is D) C2v, then E must be a molecule with that symmetry.

Another molecule with C2v symmetry is H2O. But E is a different product, so perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps E is SO2. Its structure is bent, so point group is C2v. But SO2 is a gas, but is it extremely hazardous? Yes, in high concentrations, it can be dangerous.

So, if E is SO2, its point group is C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Let me try to retrace:

1. A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (gas) → C (bright red).

Assuming B is O2, and C is SO3. Then, A would be S (sulfur). Reaction: S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3 (but that uses 3 O2 per S, which is 6 equivalents. Not 8.)

Hmm.

Alternatively, A is S, B is Cl2.

Reaction: S + 4 Cl2 → 2 SCl2. So 4 Cl2 per S. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 2 S → 4 Cl2 → 2 SCl2. So per S, 4 Cl2 → 8 Cl atoms. So that would fit the 8 equivalents.

Wait, wait! That makes sense.

So, in the first reaction:

A is S (solid), B is Cl2 (gas).

Reaction: S + 4 Cl2 → 2 SCl2.

So, 1 mole S reacts with 4 moles Cl2 (8 equivalents of Cl atoms). So that fits.

So product C is SCl2, which is a bright red liquid. But wait, SCl2 is a liquid, not solid. Wait, the product C is bright red. Maybe SCl2 is bright red. Or perhaps the product is another compound.

Wait, perhaps C is SOCl2, which is thionyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is a liquid, color is yellowish-green, but perhaps under certain conditions it's bright red.

Wait, regardless, let's proceed.

So, C is SCl2.

Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (gas) to form E (extremely hazardous). D is H2. So, 2 moles of H2 reacting with SCl2.

The reaction could be SCl2 + H2 → products. Let me think about what SCl2 would do with H2. SCl2 in the presence of H2 might hydrolyze, but that's with water. Alternatively, perhaps it reacts to form HCl and S.

But if E is a product, perhaps the reaction is SCl2 + 2 H2 → 2 HCl + S. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2S, but that's a gas, not extremely hazardous on its own, but it can be toxic.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2. Let's say SCl2 reacts with H2 to form SO2 and HCl. The reaction could be SCl2 + H2 → SO2 + 2 HCl.

Is that a valid reaction? I'm not sure, but if it is, then E would be SO2, which is a gas and can be dangerous in high concentrations.

SO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is C2v, which is option D.

Putting it all together:

1. A is S (solid), B is Cl2 (gas). Reaction: S + 4 Cl2 → 2 SCl2 (C). This uses 4 moles Cl2 (8 equivalents of Cl atoms) per mole S.

2. C (SCl2) reacts with 2 moles H2 (D) to form E (SO2). Reaction: SCl2 + H2 → SO2 + 2 HCl.

3. C (SCl2) reacts with water to form A (S) + two acids. Reaction: SCl2 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid, F) + HCl (strong acid, but perhaps another product). Wait, no, SCl2 hydrolyzes to form HCl and H2SO3 (which is weak). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, SCl2 hydrolysis in water: SCl2 + H2O → SO2↑ + 2 HCl. So the two products are SO2 (which is a gas) and HCl (strong acid). So in this case, F is HCl (strong acid), and G would be nothing else because SO2 is a gas and not an acid. Hmm, but the problem says two different acids. So perhaps this scenario is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe C is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3. Then, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the products. Let me think again.

If C is SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (strong acid) only. But the problem states two different acids, so this can't be right.

So, perhaps my initial assumption that C is SCl2 is incorrect.

Hmm.

Let me try another approach. Assume that C is SO3.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C.

If B is O2, then reaction is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. So per S, 3 O2 (6 equivalents) are used. But the problem says 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, B is Cl2, so the reaction is S + 4 Cl2 → 2 SCl2. So 4 Cl2 (8 equivalents) per S. So that fits.

So, C is SCl2.

Then, C reacts with D (H2) in 2 equivalents to form E. So SCl2 + 2 H2 → ?

Possibly, SCl2 + H2 → SO2 + 2 HCl. Then E is SO2, which has a point group of C2v.

Alternatively, another possibility: E is H2S, but I'm not sure.

In any case, if E is SO2, its point group is C2v, which is option D.

So, the answer would be D) C2v.

The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - If A is sulfur (S) and B is chlorine gas (Cl₂), the reaction is:  
     \[
     S + 4 \, \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{SCl}_2
     \]  
     This uses 4 moles of Cl₂ (8 equivalents of Cl atoms) per mole of S, fitting the stoichiometry. Thus, C is likely **SCl₂** (thionyl chloride), which is a bright red liquid.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form extremely hazardous product E.  
   - If D is hydrogen gas (H₂), the reaction could be:  
     \[
     \text{SCl}_2 + \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{SO}_2 + 2 \, \text{HCl}
     \]  
     Here, E is **SO₂** (sulfur dioxide), a bent molecule.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - SCl₂ hydrolyzes in water:  
     \[
     \text{SCl}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{SO}_2 + 2 \, \text{HCl}
     \]  
     This produces HCl (strong acid, F) and SO₂, which is not an acid but a gas. This suggests a possible inconsistency in the interpretation of G, but the key focus remains on E.

4. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - If E is SO₂, its molecular structure is bent, with a bond angle of approximately 119°. The point group of a bent molecule is **C₂v**, which corresponds to the symmetry group of SO₂.

5. **Critical Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) C₂**: This represents a two-fold rotation axis, which does not match the symmetry of SO₂.  
   - **B) D₄h**: This is the symmetry group of a square planar molecule, which does not apply to SO₂.  
   - **C) D∞h**: This is the symmetry group of a linear molecule like CO₂ or O₂, which does not match SO₂.  
   - **D) C₂v**: This is the correct symmetry group for SO₂, a bent molecule.

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E (SO₂) is **C₂v**.

Answer: D
