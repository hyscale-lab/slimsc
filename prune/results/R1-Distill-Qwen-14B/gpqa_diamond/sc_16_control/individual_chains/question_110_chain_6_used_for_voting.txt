Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both these spectrographs are used for high-resolution spectroscopy, but the question is about their detection limits based on apparent magnitude.

Wait, the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES can observe brighter than 16. So, the star must be brighter than 17 in V for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, meaning they can observe stars with V ≤17. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's V mag ≤17? Or wait, no. Wait, magnitude scale is a bit tricky. Lower magnitude means brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means stars with V ≤17? Or wait, no, because the scale is inverted. So, when a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, observed V mag should be ≤17. For HIRES, observed V mag should be ≤16.

So the star needs to have apparent V magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO to detect it, and ≤16 for HIRES to detect it. Wait no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Hmm, because brighter means lower magnitude. So if a star's V is brighter than 17 mag, meaning V <17, then ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth. The lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter it is. So if a telescope can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, that means V <17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17, and HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So a star must have V <17 to be detected by ESPRESSO, and V <16 for HIRES. Wait no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, no: if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's V <17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. The V magnitude is such that lower is brighter. So for a star to be detectable by a telescope, it must be brighter than a certain magnitude. So for ESPRESSO, if the star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with V <16 are detectable.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So that would mean that ESPRESSO can detect any star that is brighter than 17 in V, which is V <17. So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait no, wait. Because HIRES can only observe stars brighter than 16, which is V <16. So the star must have V <16 to be detected by both. Because if a star has V=16.5, it's brighter than 17 (so detectable by ESPRESSO) but fainter than 16 (so not detectable by HIRES). So to be detectable by both, the star must have V <16, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says:

- ESPRESSO: stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So V <17.

- HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed. So V <16.

So a star must be V <16 to be observed by both. Because if a star is V=16.5, it's brighter than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) but fainter than 16 (so HIRES can't). But any star with V <16 is bright enough for both.

So now, let's go through each star and calculate their apparent V magnitude.

Wait, but the stars have either absolute magnitude and distance, or apparent magnitude. So for each star, we need to compute their apparent V magnitude.

Let me list the stars and their data:

Star1:
- Absolute V mag (Mv) = 15.5
- Distance = 10 pc

Apparent V mag (mv) = Mv + 5 log10(d) -5
Because the formula is mv = Mv +5 log10 (d/10) ), which simplifies to Mv +5 (log10 d -1) ) = Mv +5 log10 d -5.

So for Star1: d=10 pc.

mv =15.5 +5*log10(10) -5 = 15.5 +5*1 -5 = 15.5 +5=20.5-5=15.5. Wait, no:

Wait, 5 log10(10) is 5*1=5. So 15.5 +5 -5 =15.5. So mv=15.5.

So Star1's apparent V mag is 15.5. Which is less than 16. So both telescopes can see it.

Wait, but wait. Because 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES would detect it, and as it's below 17, ESPRESSO can too. So Star1 is observable by both.

Wait, but then why is star1 an option in any of the options? Looking at the options, let me see:

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

So Star1 is in option D.

Wait, but let's check all stars.

Star2:
- Apparent V mag =16.5
- Distance=5pc.

So mv=16.5. Does this star have other factors?

Wait, but what's the issue with Star2. Its apparent magnitude is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, which can detect V <17, 16.5 <17, so detectable. But for HIRES, needs V <16, so 16.5 >16, so not detectable. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3:
- Apparent V mag: 15.5 mag, but it has E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, the note says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So extinction (extinction in V band, Av) = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So the observed apparent magnitude (mv) is the intrinsic plus extinction. Wait, no, wait. The formula is mv = m0 + Av, where m0 is the apparent magnitude without extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. So the observed mv is the intrinsic (what it would be without extinction) plus extinction. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

So in this case, Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, which already includes the extinction? Or is that the intrinsic apparent magnitude?

Wait, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, so the given mv is 15.5, but that's the observed (apparent) magnitude, which includes extinction. Because if E(B-V)=0.6, then Av=1.86, so the star's apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think: the apparent magnitude is what is measured through the atmosphere, which is dimmed by extinction. So the extinction is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude would be m_observed minus Av. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The formula is: observed magnitude = intrinsic magnitude + extinction. Because more extinction makes the star appear dimmer, which is a higher magnitude.

Wait, yes. So when you have extinction, the observed magnitude (m) is m = m0 + Av, where m0 is the magnitude without extinction.

So if a star's m is 15.5, and Av is 1.86, then m0 = m - Av = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

But the question is about what the telescope can detect. The telescope detects the observed magnitude. So the ESPRESSO can detect stars with m <17, and HIRES m <16.

But wait, Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, which is already corrected for extinction? Or not? Wait, in the question, Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5. But the note says that the total absorption in the V band is 3.1 times E(B-V). So probably, the apparent magnitude as given (15.5) is the one after extinction. Or perhaps not.

Wait, no, I think that the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction. Because in real terms, the apparent magnitude is always what you observe, i.e., including any extinction. So if the star has an extinction of 1.86 mag, its observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is higher (dimmer) than the actual value.

Wait, but in the star's data, Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5 mag. So for the purposes of detection, we use this value. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So both telescopes can detect it. Because 15.5 <16, so HIRES can, and 15.5 <17, so ESPRESSO can. So Star3 is observable by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If Star3's apparent V is 15.5, then both telescopes can detect it. So for both, yes.

Star4:
- Absolute V mag =15.5
- Distance=10 pc
- E(B-V)=0.4

So first compute its apparent V without considering extinction. Because the given absolute magnitude is Mv=15.5, and distance is 10 pc.

So mv (without extinction) = Mv +5 log10 (d/10) =15.5 +5 log10(1) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, the extinction Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the observed mv is 16.74.

So Star4's apparent V is 16.74.

Now, check if it's brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO (which needs V <17). 16.74 <17, so yes. For HIRES, needs V <16. 16.74>16, so no. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Wait, but Star4's apparent V is 16.74. So both telescopes can't detect it. Only ESPRESSO can.

Wait, but wait. Because the question is which stars can be detected by both. So Star4 is not.

Star5:
- Absolute V mag=16.5
- Distance=5 pc.

Compute mv without extinction: Mv +5 log10 (d/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) ≈16.5 -1.505=14.995.

Assuming no extinction because E(B-V) isn't given. So mv=14.995.

Which is less than 16 and 17. So both telescopes can detect it.

Wait, so Star5's apparent V is about 15. So both can detect it.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation. Distance is 5 pc.

So d=5, so log10(5/10)=log10(0.5)= -0.3010.

So mv=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So mv≈15.0. So yes, both telescopes can detect it.

Now, let's list each star's apparent V:

Star1: 15.5 → both detect.

Star2: 16.5 → ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

Star3: 15.5 → both detect.

Star4: 16.74 → ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

Star5: 15.0 → both detect.

Wait, so which stars can both telescopes detect? Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B says Star3 and Star5.

Option D says Star1 and Star4.

So according to our analysis, Star1, Star3, and Star5 are observable by both. But looking at the options, none of the options include all three. So probably, I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recheck each star.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star1. Let me re-calculate.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

mv = Mv +5 log10 (d/10) =15.5 +5 log10(1) =15.5 +0=15.5. So yes, mv=15.5. So both detect.

Star3: the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5. Wait, wait, the question says Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but does that include extinction? Or is that the intrinsic value?

Oh wait, the question says Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6.

So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which already includes extinction. So we don't need to add anything. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is below 16 and 17, so detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6, which implies extinction. So the mv given in the question is the observed (i.e., dimmed) magnitude. So in that case, we don't need to recalculate; the mv is already 15.5, which is acceptable.

Wait, but if the question gives mv as the observed, then Star3 is already 15.5. But if it gives the intrinsic (without extinction), then we have to add the extinction.

Wait, this is a confusion point. Let me look at the question again:

Star3's description: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. The note says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So Av=3.1*0.6=1.86.

So the question is, is the given apparent magnitude the observed (including extinction) or the intrinsic (without)?

In astronomy, the apparent magnitude is the observed value. So the given 15.5 is the apparent magnitude already including extinction. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5.

Thus, both telescopes can detect it.

Star5: computes to mv≈15.0, which is less than both 16 and 17.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Wait, in my analysis, Star1 can be detected by both. So why is option D not correct?

Because Star1's apparent V is 15.5, which is below 16 and 17. So both can detect.

Star4's mv is 16.74, which is above 16 but below 17. So ESPRESSO can detect, but HIRES can't.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, which pair is correct.

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

But in the options, there is no option with all three. So perhaps the mistake is that I miscalculated Star1.

Wait, let me check Star1's apparent magnitude again.

Star1: Mv=15.5, distance=10 pc.

mv = Mv +5*(log10(10/10)) =15.5 +5*(0) =15.5. So mv=15.5.

So both telescopes can detect it.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

Looking at the options, which combinations are possible.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. But Star4's mv is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Only Star1 can be detected by both.

So the possible correct options are:

If the question is about which pair can be detected by both, then Star3 and Star5 (Option B) and Star1 and Star3, etc.

But in the options, the only pair with two correct stars is option B.

Wait, but wait. Wait another point: I should also consider the declination and the observatory's latitude.

Wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes, so we can ignore whether the stars are visible from the observatories.

So the only criteria are the apparent V magnitudes.

So among the options, which pairs have stars with mv <16.

Looking:

Star1: mv=15.5 → yes.

Star3: 15.5 → yes.

Star5: 15.0 → yes.

So the pairs that can be detected by both are any of these. So the options that have both stars in the pair with mv <16.

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5: Star4's mv=16.74 >16, Star5=15.0. So only Star5 can be detected by both. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5: both have mv <16. So both can be detected by both telescopes. So B is correct.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2 mv=16.5>16 (can't be detected by HIRES), Star3=15.5. So only Star3 is detected by both. So C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star1=15.5, Star4=16.74. So Star1 is okay, Star4 is not. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is B) Star3 and Star5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. The key criteria are:

1. **ESPRESSO Detection**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( V < 17 \)).
2. **HIRES Detection**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( V < 16 \)).

Thus, a star must have \( V < 16 \) to be detectable by both telescopes.

### Analysis of Each Star

#### **Star1**
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M_V = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Apparent V Magnitude**:  
  \[
  m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m_V = 15.5 < 16 \), so Star1 is detectable by both telescopes.

#### **Star2**
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m_V = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Conclusion**: \( m_V = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 is detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

#### **Star3**
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m_V = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Extinction in V Band**:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]
- **Observed Apparent Magnitude**:  
  The given \( m_V = 15.5 \) already includes extinction, so no further adjustment is needed.
- **Conclusion**: \( m_V = 15.5 < 16 \), so Star3 is detectable by both telescopes.

#### **Star4**
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M_V = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Apparent V Magnitude (Intrinsic)**:  
  \[
  m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
  \]
- **Extinction in V Band**:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]
- **Observed Apparent Magnitude**:  
  \[
  m_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m_V = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 is detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

#### **Star5**
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M_V = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Apparent V Magnitude**:  
  \[
  m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 \approx 15.0
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m_V \approx 15.0 < 16 \), so Star5 is detectable by both telescopes.

### Final Answer
The stars detectable by both telescopes are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the provided options, the correct pair is **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
