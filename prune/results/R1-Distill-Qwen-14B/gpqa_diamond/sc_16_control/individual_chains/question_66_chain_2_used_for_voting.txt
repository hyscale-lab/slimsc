Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The possible choices are combinations of these.

First, what's SMEFT? From what I remember, it's a framework where you take the Standard Model (SM) and consider adding higher-dimensional operators to it. These operators are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually denoted Λ. The idea is that these operators parameterize the effects of new physics beyond the SM.

Now, when you write down these effective operators, you have to make sure they respect the symmetries of the SM. Because if they don't, you might end up with operators that aren't allowed by the underlying theory.

Wait, so which symmetries are part of the SM? Well, the SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotational and boost symmetries. Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz plus translations. Oh wait, but in the context of effective field theories, Poincare symmetry is more about the structure of the theory, like requiring the action to be invariant under spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations.

But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. So when you construct operators, do you need to respect all the symmetries of the UV (ultraviolet) theory, or just the ones that the effective theory itself has? I think SMEFT is built to respect the same symmetries as the SM because it's an effective theory that extends the SM. So any operator you add must be compatible with the SM's symmetries.

So considering the options:

1. Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz-invariant. Because if they weren't, that would mean they don't respect the same symmetries as the SM. So yes, this is definitely a must.

2. Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are higher-dimensional. So their form must respect the symmetries of the SM. So if an operator isn't Poincare-invariant, it would break the symmetries. So I think all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but wait, wait. Oh wait, no, because in effective theories, you can have operators that are not Poincare-invariant? Or do they all have to be?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. In the SMEFT, the operators are added to the SM Lagrangian. The SM Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. Therefore, any term added must also be Poincare-invariant. Because if you add a term that isn't, the entire Lagrangian would not be Poincare-invariant anymore. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translation symmetry.

Wait, but wait another thing. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation. So when you add an operator, say, to the SM Lagrangian, it has to be a local operator that respects both. So yes, they must respect Poincare symmetry.

Hmm, but some sources say that Poincare symmetry is automatically respected in the SMEFT. Or maybe that's not the case. Because in SMEFT, you can have higher-dimensional operators that may not have the same transformation properties as the SM fields. Wait, no, because you have to construct them from SM fields.

Wait, no. The SM fields are Poincare-invariant. So any operator built from them in a way that's consistent with the SM's symmetry structure should also be Poincare-invariant. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if both Lorentz and Poincare are needed, then both 1 and 2 are required.

So moving on to 3. CP symmetry. The SM doesn't enforce CP symmetry. In fact, CP violation is a known feature of the SM, like in the CKM matrix. So the SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP, right? Because the SM itself allows for CP violation. So the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry. The SM is CPT-symmetric. So all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. Because if you add an operator that isn't CPT-symmetric, it would break that symmetry in the theory. So yes, 4 is correct.

Putting it together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. So including Poincare would imply that the operator respects both Lorentz and translation symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's also respecting Lorentz. So in the list given, the options are 1,2,3,4.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the correct choice would be option C: 1,2,4.

But wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So 1,2,4 are needed.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct choice.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) where higher-dimensional operators are added to parameterize the effects of new physics beyond the SM. When constructing these operators, they must respect the symmetries of the SM to ensure consistency with the underlying theory. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and any operator added to SMEFT must also respect this symmetry. If an operator violates Lorentz symmetry, it would break the framework's consistency. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since the SM Lagrangian is Poincaré-invariant, any operator added to SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. If an operator violates Poincaré symmetry, the entire Lagrangian would lose this symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for operators in SMEFT. Operators that violate CP symmetry are permissible.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-symmetric, and all operators in SMEFT must preserve this symmetry. If an operator violates CPT symmetry, it would lead to inconsistencies in the theory. Hence, CPT symmetry must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
