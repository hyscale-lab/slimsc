Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the setup: Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment because gas can interfere with the electron beam. But even with that, some gas molecules are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume, I think. Oh wait, right, the mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So under the same conditions, a lower pressure (which is achieved here with the vacuum) would give a longer mean free path. That makes sense because if the pressure is lower, there are fewer molecules, so the gas molecules don't collide as often, so they can travel further on average.

But then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, but the temperature is the same as before. So why would λ change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, the mean free path in the initial state (λ1) is determined by the thermal motion of the gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high speeds. Do the gas molecules interact with the electrons?

I remember that in electron microscopy, gas molecules can cause electron scattering. The electrons can hit the gas molecules and get scattered, which affects the image. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Wait, the mean free path λ is about how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. So if the electron beam is on, are there more interactions between electrons and gas molecules, or between gas molecules themselves?

Hmm, when the electron beam is active, the electrons are moving through the vacuum chamber. The gas molecules are present, so the electrons might collide with them. But the gas molecules might also be getting some energy from these collisions. Could that cause the gas to heat up? Or maybe the electron beam induces some energy transfer.

Wait, but the question says the temperature of the sample compartment remains the same. So any heating effect is presumably negligible or not happening here. So temperature isn't the reason.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes ionization of the gas molecules. If the gas molecules get ionized, they might behave differently. Ionized particles have different properties—like charge—which could affect their movement and interactions.

But wait, in the initial scenario, without the electron beam, the mean free path is λ1. With the electron beam, it's λ2. How would the electron beam influence the mean free path?

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the electrons might be causing the gas molecules to move more, perhaps by scattering off them. If the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, does that change their effective speed or the rate at which they collide with each other?

Wait, the mean free path is primarily a function of the gas's own pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. If the conditions (like pressure or temperature) don't change, the mean free path shouldn't change. But in this case, the presence of the electron beam may introduce another factor.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize and form charged particles. If the molecules are charged, their interactions might change. Alternatively, maybe the beam induces some sort of electric field that affects the gas's movement.

Wait, but the mean free path is about the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with others of the same kind. If the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, that's a different kind of collision—does that count towards the mean free path? Because the mean free path is about collisions between gas molecules, not between gas and something else.

Oh, that's a key point. The mean free path λ1 was calculated under the assumption that the gas is in thermal equilibrium, and the dominant collisions are between gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are also colliding with electrons. So, each time a gas molecule collides with an electron, that's another kind of collision, which would effectively reduce the mean free path.

Because now, the gas molecules are colliding more frequently—not just with each other, but also with electrons. So the average distance between their own-type collisions (gas-gas) would be shorter than before because they're colliding with something else more often.

Wait, no. Let's think: the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other gas molecules. If there are other particles (like electrons) in the chamber, the gas molecules can collide with them as well. So the total collision rate increases, which would decrease the mean free path for gas-gas collisions.

So, the presence of electrons (or other particles) increases the overall collision rate, meaning that the mean free path λ (for gas-gas collisions) would be shorter than before. Because the gas molecules are colliding more frequently—either with each other or with the electrons—so the average distance between gas-gas collisions is shorter.

So, λ2 would be less than λ1. Because λ1 was based purely on gas-gas interactions, ignoring any other collisions. But when the electron beam is on, gas molecules are colliding with electrons, which happens at a different rate.

Another way to think about it: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision frequency. If the collision frequency increases (more frequent collisions), the mean free path decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

So, looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the correct conclusion.

When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, with a mean free path of gas molecules determined as λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ2, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path (λ) is primarily determined by the pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter of the gas. Initially, λ1 was calculated based on gas-gas collisions under thermal equilibrium conditions. When the electron beam is activated, additional interactions occur: gas molecules collide not only with each other but also with the high-energy electrons in the beam. These electron-gas collisions increase the overall collision rate, reducing the average distance between gas-gas collisions. As a result, the mean free path λ2 becomes shorter than λ1.

Thus, the presence of the electron beam effectively reduces the mean free path of gas molecules due to increased collision frequency, leading to the conclusion that λ2 < λ1.
