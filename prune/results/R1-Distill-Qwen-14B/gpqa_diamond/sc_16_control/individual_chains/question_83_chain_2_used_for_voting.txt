Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, okay, let's see what it's asking. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water and then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, okay, let me break this down. First, the initial solution is made by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I remember that when you dilute a solution, the amount of solute stays the same. So the moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. Let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters.

After dilution with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid and NaOH: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

The question asks about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ added, how much has reacted?

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So since the reaction is 1:1, 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized, forming CH3COO^-.

So the initial moles: 0.001 mol CH3COOH.
After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH: 
Moles CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
Moles CH3COO^- formed = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is now initial volume (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, the Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, approximately 4.73).

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:
pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)
Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.005882 divided by 0.017647 is approximately 0.33333, yes. Log(1/3) is -0.477. So yes, pH is around 4.25. Looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92, option A is 4.26 and something. Option A's first value is 4.26, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate the concentrations. Initial moles are 0.001, after adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, which is 0.00025 mol. So moles of acid left: 0.00075. Moles of conjugate base: 0.00025.

But the total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [A^-] = 0.00025 /0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. So log is -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So around 4.25. So the first value, 25% titration, would be approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, which is very close.

Now, what's the equivalence point pH? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So, moles of CH3COO^- at equivalence: 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ =50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. It will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

The Kb is small, so we can use the approximation for weak bases. The concentration of OH^- can be found using:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] 

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^-.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98. So pH = 14 -4.98 ≈9.02.

Wait, but wait. Are any of the options close to that? Let's look again. 

Option A: 4.26;8.52. Hmm, 8.52 is higher than my calculation. Option D says 6.92 at equivalence, which is way lower. Option B's equivalence is 6.73. Option C is 7.00.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02) → x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 =1.081e-11. So x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5. pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02. So none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the equivalence point. Let's double-check the moles and solution.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Adding 10 cm³ of NaOH makes 50 cm³. Moles of CH3COO^- is 0.001 moles. So 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH more accurately. Let's compute x more precisely.

x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5?

Wait, sqrt(1.081)= approx 1.0399, so x=1.0399e-5.5? Wait, 1e-5.5 is the same as 3.16e-6, but wait, 1e-5.5 is actually 3.16e-6? Wait, no. Wait, 10^(-5.5) = 10^(-5) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-5 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-6. So 1.0399e-5.5 is about 1.0399 * 3.162e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the exponents. Let me compute sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. So 1.081e-11. Let me compute it precisely.

Wait, 1.081e-11 is 1.081 *1e-11. The square root is sqrt(1.081) *1e-5.5.

sqrt(1.081)= approx 1.0399. So 1.0399 * (1e-5.5)= 1.0399 * (3.162e-6) ≈ 3.28e-6.

Wait, so [OH^-] =3.28e-6. So pOH = -log(3.28e-6) = let's compute that. Log(3.28) is about 0.515. So log(3.28e-6)=0.515 -6= -5.485. So pOH=5.485. pH=14-5.485=8.515.

Oh! So the pH at equivalence is about 8.515. So approximately 8.52.

So, putting it all together, the pH at 25% titration is about 4.25, and at equivalence it's about 8.52. Looking at the options:

Option A is 4.26;8.52. That matches.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the 25% titration, I thought it was about 4.25 which matches option A as 4.26. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but why did I get a pH of ~4.25, and the options have 4.26. That's very close. So that must be option A.

But wait, wait! Did I make a mistake in the 25% titration? Let me re-examine the calculations.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L =0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially:0.001. So moles remaining: 0.00075. Moles of acetate ion: 0.00025.

Total volume:42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425= 0.017647 M. [A^-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

0.005882 / 0.017647= 0.33333333.

Log(0.3333)= -0.4771.

pKa is 4.73.

So pH=4.73 -0.4771=4.2529≈4.25.

So option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close. Any small calculation differences could lead to that.

So the options are:

A) 4.26;8.52

So the two values match.

Wait, but what about the equivalence point pH? Earlier calculation gave around 8.52. So option A is the only one that matches both.

But looking at the other options, for instance, option D has 4.57 and 6.92, which don't match. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73, which are lower. Option C is 4.73 and 7.00, which are the pKa and something close to neutral, but not matching the equivalence point.

So the correct answer must be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( \text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is \( 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.25, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. These values match the options in **A**.
