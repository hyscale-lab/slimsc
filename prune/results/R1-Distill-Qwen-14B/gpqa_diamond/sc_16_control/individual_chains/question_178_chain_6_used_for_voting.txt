Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? I remember that σ matrices are related to the commutators of gamma matrices, which are used in Dirac equations. But I'm not sure how that affects the dimensions here.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D, each giving a dimension and a renormalizability status.

First, I think I should figure out the mass dimension of each part of the Lagrangian. Because in quantum field theory, the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless). So each term's mass dimension must add up to zero when considering the units.

Wait, wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because when you integrate it over d^4x, the action (which is dimensionless) would have the integral of a dimension 4 quantity. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Because when you integrate a dimension 4 term over d^4x (which is dimension 4), the result is dimensionless.

But wait, no. Wait, the Lagrangian density is the integrand, so it must have mass dimension 4, because the action is ∫ L d^4x, which is dimensionless. So each term in L must have dimension 4. So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So in the given L, each term is a product of fields and coupling constants, and each must have dimension 4.

So let's break down L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each of these fields has their own dimensions. I remember that for Dirac spinors ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the equation of motion is (∂/i - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, ψ must have dimension 3/2 to balance the mass term (m ψ would need ψ to have 3/2 to make [mψ] = 3/2 + 1 = 5/2? Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the term m ψ would have dimension [m] + [ψ]. The mass m is dimension 1 (since in natural units, energy and mass are the same dimension). So if the term m ψ is part of the Lagrangian, which must be dimension 4, then [m] + [ψ] must be 4. So [ψ] is 3. Because 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that makes sense. Because the term m ψ̄ ψ is in the Lagrangian. So [m ψ̄ ψ] = [m] + [ψ̄] + [ψ]. Wait, [ψ̄] is the same as [ψ], so 1 + 3 + 3 = 7, which is way too big. Hmm, I must be getting something wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, the term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which is the kinetic term. Let me think again. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So the kinetic term is ψ̄ ∂ ψ. Each ψ is 3/2. So 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = (3/2 + 3/2) is 3, plus 1 is 4. Oh, right! So each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because ψ̄ (same as ψ) has dimension 3/2, and the derivative adds 1. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4, which matches the required dimension for the Lagrangian.

So [ψ] = 3/2.

Now, what about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A is a vector potential. The vector potential A_μ has mass dimension 1. Because the field strength F is ∂ A, so ∂ has dimension 1, A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 2. Wait, because each derivative adds 1, and each A_μ adds 1? Wait, F^{μν} is made from ∂_μ A_ν, so each A has dimension 1, each derivative adds 1, so F has dimension 1+1=2.

So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Next, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. These are gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So any term involving σ_{μν} would inherit the dimensions from the fields it's acting on. Since σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, the σ_{μν} itself is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) times σ (0) times ψ (3/2), so total dimension is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Wait, but the entire term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So that's [ψ̄ σ ψ] × [F]. Let me compute each part.

[ψ̄ σ ψ] is [ψ̄][σ][ψ] → (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Because σ is dimensionless, it doesn't contribute. Then [F] is 2. So the whole term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5. 

Wait, no. Wait, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimensions are [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. Oh, wait, but σ is part of the term, but it's a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] is 0. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F]. Because σ doesn't contribute. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, and [F] is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus 2 is 5. So the entire term is [κ] +5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, this means [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. The renormalizability depends on the superficial degree of divergence. Alternatively, the theory is renormalizable if the coupling dimension is positive.

Wait, let me recall. In four dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is less than or equal to 4 minus the sum of the dimensions of the fields in that term. Or perhaps, another way: each coupling's dimension must be ≥ the sum of the fields' dimensions minus 4. Or perhaps I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.

Alternatively, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions). Or wait, no, it's the opposite. The general rule is that in four dimensions, a term is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ (sum of the fields' dimensions) -4.

Wait, I think I should think about the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree D is given by D = d - (n_F + n_B + ... ), where n_F is the number of fermion fields, etc. Wait, perhaps another approach: for a term with coupling κ, and fields ψ, F, etc., the condition for renormalizability is that the dimension of the coupling [κ] must be ≥ (sum of the dimensions of the fields) -4.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me think about the term again. The term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

So, the sum of the fields' dimensions: ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So total is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. So the sum is 5. So for renormalizability, the coupling should have dimension [κ] ≥ (5) -4 =1.

Wait, no. Wait, the general condition is that for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling ( [κ] ) must be ≥ (sum of field dimensions) -4.

Because each field in the term contributes its dimension, and the Lagrangian term's dimension must be 4. So [κ] + [fields] =4 → [κ] =4 - [fields]. For the term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling should be ≥0, because otherwise the theory would require an infinite number of counterterms (non-renormalizable).

Wait, no. The renormalizable condition is that the term has [coupling] ≥ 0. Because if [coupling] is negative, the term would have higher dimension, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, let me think again. The Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for a term like κ (fields), [κ] + [fields] =4. For renormalizability, we require that each coupling has [κ] ≥ (sum of [fields] ) -4. So [κ] ≥ (sum of [fields]) -4. If [κ] is positive, then (sum of [fields]) ≤4 + [κ]. But since [κ] is positive, sum [fields] ≤4 + something positive. So if sum [fields] is greater than 4, the coupling must have [κ] ≥ sum -4.

Wait, perhaps I should look at it via scaling. The term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Each field contributes its dimension, and the coupling contributes its own. So [κ] =4 - sum [fields].

In this case, sum [fields] is 3/2 (ψ̄) +3/2 (ψ) +2 (F) = 3/2 *2 +2 = 3+2=5. So [κ] =4 -5 =-1.

So the coupling has [κ]=-1. Now, the question is whether the theory is renormalizable.

Renormalizable theories require that all couplings have non-negative mass dimensions. If the coupling has a negative dimension, the interaction term has a higher mass dimension than 4, which makes it non-renormalizable because you can't absorb the divergences with a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, but wait. The standard approach is that a term is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ (d - sum of field dimensions), where d is the spacetime dimension. For d=4, [κ] ≥ 4 - sum [fields].

Wait, sum [fields] is 5. So 4 -5 =-1. So [κ] ≥-1.

But here, [κ] is exactly -1. So it's on the boundary. Hmm, but I think that the condition for renormalizability is that each coupling has dimension ≥0. Because if it's negative, the term is higher-dimensional, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, let me think about examples. The Fermi theory of weak interactions has a four-fermion interaction term with coupling dimension [κ] = -2 (since each fermion is 3/2, four of them sum to 6; [κ] =4 -6= -2). That theory is non-renormalizable because the coupling has negative dimension.

In our case, [κ]=-1. So it's negative. Thus, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it all together:

Mass dimension of κ is -1. The theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, option C says mass dimension -1 and not renormalizable, option A says dimension -1 and renormalizable. So the correct answer would be C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, and its adjoint $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for electromagnetism has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions, as it is the integrand of the action, which is dimensionless. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes the following dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$,
- $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$,
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$,
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$ (dimensionless).

Thus, the total dimension of the field term is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have dimension 4, the dimension of $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is higher-dimensional and the theory is non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them not predictive at higher energy scales.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
