Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I think I remember that this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's the next rotational state, vibrational state, or a combination of both. Oh wait, the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I should consider which transition has the least energy difference.

But wait, maybe in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized in a way that includes both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels might be a combination of the two. The fundamental state is the lowest in both vibration and rotation, so the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? I think in these models, the next state would be the first excited state, which could involve either increasing the vibrational quantum number (v) or the rotational (r). But since the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones (because vibration involves bond stretching, which is a stronger potential), the vibrational transition might require more energy than rotational. So if the photon is causing a transition to the next possible state, I might need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state, whether it's a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but the problem says the photon is absorbed, so the molecule goes to the next state, but which transition gives the smallest possible energy increase. So maybe we're looking for the smallest ΔE. Because the photon's energy should match that ΔE.

So the fundamental state is v=0 and r=0, perhaps. The next state could be v=1, r=0, or v=0, r=1, or maybe a combination.

But wait, the model might consider the energy as a sum of vibrational and rotational contributions. So the energy levels are given by E(v, r) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(r). So the fundamental state is v=0, r=0. The next possible states would be v=1, r=0 or v=0, r=1. Which of these has a lower energy difference?

Let me think about the energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2) h w. For v=0, E= (1/2) h w. So for v=1, it's (3/2) h w. The difference ΔE_vib is h w.

For rotational energy, the formula is E_rot(r) = [ (r)(r+1) ] h c / (8 I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the first rotational state (r=1) would have E_rot = (1×2) h c/(8I) = 2 h c/(8I) = h c/(4I). So the difference from r=0 is that same value.

So to find which transition gives a lower photon energy, we need to compare the vibrational transition (ΔE_vib = h w) with the rotational transition (ΔE_rot = h c/(4I)).

Which one is smaller? Let me compute both.

Given:
w = 4e14 rad/s
c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s
I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu. Wait, 20 times 2 is 40, but denominator is 20+2=22. So 40/22 reduces to 20/11, which is about 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

So 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly:

20 * 2 =40, 20+2=22. So μ = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.81818...) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016, so μ ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Then I = μ r². r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = h c / (4 I).

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.
c is 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE_rot = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4 * 1.2064e-46 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J s m/s.

Denominator:4 *1.2064e-46 = 4.8256e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = (1.9878e-25) / (4.8256e-46 ) = approx 4.12e20 J.

Wait, that can't be right because 1eV is about 1.6e-19 J, so 4e20 J is way too high. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

ΔE_rot = h c / (4 I ) 

h =6.626e-34 J s
c=3e8 m/s
I=1.2064e-46 kg m²

So:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Divide by 4*1.2064e-46 =4.8256e-46.

So 1.9878e-25 /4.8256e-46 = (1.9878 /4.8256 ) *1e21 ≈ 0.412 *1e21 =4.12e20 J.

Wait, that's 4.12e20 J, which is way more than the energy from a photon. Because photons with visible light have energies around 1e-19 to 1e-17 J. So this can't be right. Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. The rotational energy levels are given by (r(r+1)) * h c/(8 I ), so the difference between r=0 and r=1 is h c/(8 I ) for r=1 minus r=0 (since for r=0, E=0).

Wait, no. For r=0, E_rot=0. For r=1, E_rot = [1*(1+1)] * h c/(8 I )= 2 h c/(8 I )= h c/(4 I ). So the energy difference is h c/(4 I ).

Wait, but that gives the same calculation as before. So then this energy is way higher than the vibrational energy. Hmmm.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference is h w. Let me compute h w.

h=6.626e-34 J s
w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is about 1.65e-5 eV, since 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 2.65e-19 J is roughly 1.65 eV.

Wait, but the rotational energy difference, 4.12e20 J, that's 4.12e20 / 1.6e-19 = 2.575e39 eV, which is way beyond anything. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy. Let me double-check.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot(r) = [ r(r+1) ] * h c / (8 I ), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the transition from r=0 to r=1 would involve a change of:

E_rot(r=1) - E_rot(r=0) = [ 2 h c / 8 I ] - 0 = h c/(4 I )

Wait, that's correct. So the energy difference for rotational transition is h c/(4 I ) = (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(4 *1.2064e-46 )

Wait, let me compute that again.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m. Because J is kg m²/s², and h is J s, c is m/s, so hc is J m.

Denominator: 4 * 1.2064e-46 = 4.8256e-46 kg m².

So (1.9878e-25 J m) / (4.8256e-46 kg m² )

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, denominator is kg m². So J m is kg m²/s² * m = kg m^3/s². Hmm, maybe I'm complicating.

Wait, let me compute the numbers. 

1.9878e-25 / 4.8256e-46 = (1.9878 /4.8256 ) * 1e21 ≈0.412 * 1e21 =4.12e20 J.

But that's way too high. Wait, 4e20 J is 4e20 / (1.6e-19 J/eV ) = 2.5e39 eV. That can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for I. The moment of inertia is I = μ r².

Wait, r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So r² is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is (20 * 2 )/(20 +2 ) * 1.6605e-27 kg = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg m². That part is correct.

Hmm... So what's the issue. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake in the formula for rotational energy. Because in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized, but the spacing isn't as large as I'm computing.

Wait, maybe I should instead compute the rotational energy in terms of w_rot, the rotational angular frequency.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels can also be expressed as E_rot(r) = r(r+1) * h c / (8 I ), but sometimes people express it in terms of the rotational constant B, where B = h/(8 π² c I). Then, the energy levels are E_rot(r) = B r(r+1) c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B, the rotational constant.

B = h/(8 π² I )

Wait, let me compute that. Because B is in cm⁻¹, sometimes.

But perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So what is the next state with the lowest possible energy? It's the first excited state, which can be either the next vibrational level (v=1) or the next rotational state (r=1).

We have to find which transition requires less energy. Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference ΔE of the transition.

So compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot, then choose the smaller one.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

ΔE_rot is the energy needed to go from r=0 to r=1.

E_rot(r=1) = [1*(1+1)] (h c)/(8 I) = 2 (h c)/(8 I )= (h c)/(4 I )

So compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s
c=3e8 m/s
I=1.2064e-46 kg m²

ΔE_rot = (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) / (4 * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator:4 *1.2064e-46 =4.8256e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = (1.9878e-25 ) / (4.8256e-46 ) J.

Calculating that: 1.9878e-25 /4.8256e-46 = approximately 4.12e20 J.

Wait, that's way larger than the vibrational energy. So the ΔE_rot is about 4.12e20 J, which is way bigger than ΔE_vib of 2.65e-19 J. So the vibrational transition requires less energy. But wait, this can't be right because rotational transitions usually require much less energy than vibration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for ΔE_rot.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot(r) = [ r(r+1) ] * h c / (8 I ), so the energy difference between r=0 and r=1 is E(1) - E(0) = (2 h c)/(8 I ) - 0 = h c/(4 I )

Wait, that's what I did before. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the numbers are way off, which suggests that the rotational transition requires much more energy than the vibrational.

So the photon's energy must match the smaller ΔE, which is the vibrational one.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought rotational transitions have lower energy. Maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference in terms of frequency.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 π² I c )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me look for another approach.

Alternatively, the rotational energy can be expressed as E_rot = (r(r+1)) * (h/(8 π²)) * (1/( I c ) )

Wait, perhaps using the rotational frequency.

Alternatively, think about the moment of inertia in terms of bond length and reduced mass.

But regardless, the calculation suggests that the rotational transition requires a much higher energy than the vibrational. Therefore, the photon's energy needed for the next state would be the vibrational transition.

Wait, but wait a second: in the quantum rotation-vibration model, transitions can be both vibrational and rotational. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change both vibrational and rotational states. But since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, perhaps it's the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

But given that the vibrational transition energy is much lower than the rotational I calculated, which isn't possible, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, μ is (20 *2 )/(20 +2 ) amu =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

I = μ r². r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

r squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I =3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg m². Correct.

Now, the rotational energy for r=1 is E_rot = (1)(2) h c/(8 I ) = 2 h c/(8 I ) = h c/(4 I )

So h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 4 I =4 *1.2064e-46 =4.8256e-46 kg m².

So E_rot =1.9878e-25 /4.8256e-46 = approx 4.12e20 J.

Wait, that's 4.12e20 J, which is 4.12e20 / 1.6e-19 =2.575e39 eV. That's way more than typical photon energies. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have used the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency, not energy. Rotational energy levels are E= r(r+1) ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = ħ ω_rot.

Wait, but how to compute ω_rot? The rotational angular frequency is given by ω_rot = sqrt( k / I ), but I don't have k here. Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, another approach: The vibrational energy difference is h w, which is given as 4e14 rad/s. So let's compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Now, what about the rotational energy difference? Let me compute ΔE_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the rotational energy levels.

The energy levels for rotation are E_rot(r) = (r(r+1) h c )/(8 I )

So for r=0 to r=1, ΔE_rot = [ (2 h c )/(8 I ) ] - 0 = h c/(4 I )

But wait, I have I =1.2064e-46 kg m².

So h c/(4 I ) = (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(4 *1.2064e-46 )= (1.9878e-25 )/(4.8256e-46 ) ≈4.12e20 J.

That's way too large. So the rotational transition requires way more energy than the vibrational one. So, the next state would be due to the vibrational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy should be equal to h w, which is 2.65e-19 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is related to energy E by E = p c.

Wait, right! For a photon, E = p c. So p = E / c.

So if E is 2.65e-19 J, then p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approximately 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, momentum is in N s (since 1 N =1 kg m/s², so N s = kg m/s).

So p =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1.9e-28 Ns
Option B) 2.3e-27
Option C)1.1e-27
Option D)1.4e-28

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is approximately 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.8e-28 N s. None of the options match that.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the next state isn't just a pure vibrational or rotational state, but a combination. Because in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are a combination of both.

Wait, the fundamental state is (v=0, r=0). The next state in energy could be (v=1, r=0), or (v=0, r=1), or (v=1, r=1), etc. But the next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest increase in energy.

So which transition has the smallest ΔE? It could be either the vibrational transition or the rotational. So I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot, and choose the smaller one.

But from earlier, ΔE_rot is 4e20 J, which is way bigger than ΔE_vib of 2.65e-19 J. Therefore, the photon's energy should be 2.65e-19 J, and the momentum p is E/c = 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options are close to that. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, which is about half of our calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate E = h w.

h=6.626e-34 J s
w=4e14 rad/s.

E =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s. So 8.8e-28.

Looking at the options, the only option in the 1e-28 range is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). So 8.8e-28 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the next state isn't the first vibrational transition, but a combination of both. Like (v=1, r=0) is higher in energy than (v=0, r=1), so the molecule would preferentially make the transition to the lower energy next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a purely rotational transition, not vibrational. But why would that be the case when the vibrational transition is lower in energy.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for rotational energy is different. Maybe I should use the formula E_rot(r) = [ r(r+1) ] * (h/(8π²)) (1/( I c )) ) * c, which would give E_rot in terms of cm⁻¹ or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is [ r(r+1) ] * ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency. But without knowing ω_rot, I can't proceed that way.

Wait, maybe ω_rot can be found from the bond length and the reduced mass. Because ω_rot = sqrt( (k_rot)/I ), but without k_rot, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is much smaller than I thought. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the rotational constant B, where B = h/(8 π² I c ). Then, the energy difference ΔE_rot = B * hc.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me try.

B = h/(8 π² I c ) 

h=6.626e-34 J s
I=1.2064e-46 kg m²
c=3e8 m/s

So,

B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.2064e-46 *3e8 )

Calculate denominator: 8 * π² ≈78.9568
78.9568 *1.2064e-46 = approx 95.23e-46 =9.523e-45
Multiply by 3e8: 9.523e-45 *3e8=2.8569e-36

So B ≈6.626e-34 /2.8569e-36 ≈232 s⁻¹.

Wait, B is in cm⁻¹ perhaps. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but if B is about 232 cm⁻¹, then the energy difference ΔE_rot for r=1 would be 2B, because r(r+1) for r=1 is 2.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should find E_rot in terms of B.

Another approach: The rotational energy levels are E_rot(r) = (r(r+1)) * ħ c B, where B is the rotational constant in cm⁻¹.

But without knowing B, perhaps I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotational frequency ω_rot from I and bond length.

Wait, the rotational angular frequency is given by ω_rot = sqrt( k/(I) ), but without k, the force constant, which I don't have, this doesn't help.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to reconsider the problem. The question asks for the momentum of the photon that switches the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That state would be the one with the smallest energy difference from the fundamental state.

Given that, the vibrational transition requires much less energy than the rotational one, so the photon's momentum is that of the vibrational transition.

But the calculation of 8.8e-28 N s isn't among the options. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum.

Wait, E = h w, and p = E/(c).

So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E / (3e8) =2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the next state where both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers increase. But that would be a higher energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational states, but the lowest energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1) with the same rotational state (r=0). So the photon's energy is h w.

But that gives p=8.8e-28, which isn't an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate E_vib.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approximately 8.83e-28 N s.

Hmm. The options are all different. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, the question states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor. So perhaps for a diatomic molecule, the bond length isn't fixed, but this might affect the moment of inertia in some way. Wait, but the moment of inertia is dependent on the bond length and the reduced mass. If the bond length changes, I changes, but in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps we consider an average bond length or the bond length in the ground state.

Wait, but the given bond length is R=2 angstroms, so I think I used that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could be (v=1, r=0) or (v=0, r=1), whichever has a lower energy.

But according to my earlier calculations, (v=1, r=0) requires less energy than (v=0, r=1), so the photon's energy should be that of the vibrational transition.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, let's recalculate I.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu ) / 22 amu =40/22= 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m )^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Correct.

So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are considered together, and the next state is a combination.

But I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I don't know why.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the photon's momentum uses the reduced mass in a different way. Or perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy not just for a pure vibrational transition but also a rotational one, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the vibrational frequency, but maybe I should include the zero-point energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is v=0, so the energy is (1/2) h w.

The next vibrational state is v=1, with energy (3/2) h w. So the energy difference is h w.

Wait, that's correct. So E_photon =h w.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns.

Wait, 1.9e-28 is approx 2e-28, which is about 2.3 times smaller than our calculated value. Did I make an error in a unit conversion?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

h =6.626e-34 J s
w=4e14 rad/s.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in vibration is v=0. But if the rotational state is not zero, perhaps the next state could involve a lower rotational state.

Wait, no. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so both v=0 and r=0.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could involve a change in both v and r. But that would give a higher energy, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state with the lowest possible energy is a change in rotation only. But earlier calculation suggests that the rotational transition requires more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the rotational transition as the next state, but that would be incorrect because the vibrational transition is lower in energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy is E = [r(r+1)] * ħ c / (4 I )

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe the formula is E = [r(r+1)] * ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

But without knowing ω_rot, I can't compute it.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition's momentum, which is approximately 8.8e-28 N s. Since none of the options are close, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference is h w, but sometimes people use units of cm⁻¹ for wavenumbers, where wavenumber ν̃ = w/(2π c).

ν̃ = (4e14)/(2π *3e8) = (4e14)/(6e8 π) ≈ (4e14)/(1.885e9) ≈ 2.117e5 cm⁻¹.

Then the energy per mole would be related to that, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy can be calculated using the formula for rotational energy and considering that the rotational constant is B= h/(8 π² I c )

Wait, compute B:

h=6.626e-34 J s
I=1.2064e-46 kg m²
c=3e8 m/s

B=6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.2064e-46 *3e8 )

Compute the denominator:

8 * π² ≈78.9568

78.9568 *1.2064e-46 =95.23e-46 =9.523e-45

Multiply by 3e8: 9.523e-45 *3e8=2.8569e-36

So B=6.626e-34 /2.8569e-36 ≈232.05 cm⁻¹.

So the energy difference for rotational transition from r=0 to r=1 is 2 B c h ?

Wait, no. Because the energy levels are E_rot(r) = B r(r+1) h c.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think. 

B is in cm⁻¹, so the energy corresponding to cm⁻¹ is E = h c ν̃, so E = h c B.

Wait, no. B in cm⁻¹ is E = h c B (in Joules). So for r=1, the energy is 2 B h c.

Wait, but this is getting confusing. Let's compute the energy for r=1.

E_rot = B * r(r+1) * h c.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: B is given in cm⁻¹, so E_rot(r) = B * r(r+1) * hc.

So for r=1, E_rot = B * (2) * h c.

But B is in cm⁻¹, so E_rot = 2 * B * h c.

Wait, substituting B=232 cm⁻¹,

E_rot = 2 *232 * h c.

But wait, h c is 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

Hmm, but what's the unit? 232 cm⁻¹ times h c in J m.

Wait, maybe I should convert B to m⁻¹. Since 1 cm⁻¹ =100 m⁻¹.

So B =232 cm⁻¹ =232 *100 m⁻¹= 23200 m⁻¹.

E_rot(r=1) = 2 * B * h c = 2 *23200 m⁻¹ *6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s.

Compute that:

2 *23200 =46400.

46400 *6.626e-34 *3e8 =46400 * 1.9878e-25 =approx 92,275e-25 =9.2275e-21 J.

So ΔE_rot =9.2275e-21 J.

Now, comparing this to the vibrational energy difference of 2.65e-19 J, the rotational transition requires about 3.5% of the vibrational energy. So this is the smaller ΔE.

Wait, so the photon's energy should be 9.23e-21 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c =9.23e-21 /3e8 =3.076e-29 kg m/s =3.076e-29 N s.

But looking at the options, none are close to that. The closest is option D)1.4e-28, which is four times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, when B is in cm⁻¹, the energy E is given by E = h c / λ, where λ is in cm, so ν̃ (cm⁻¹) = E/(h c).

So if B is in cm⁻¹, E_rot(r) = B * r(r+1) * h c.

Wait, but that would give E in J. So for r=1,

E_rot =2 * B * h c.

But B is 232 cm⁻¹ =232 *1e2 m⁻¹.

So,

E_rot =2 *232e2 m⁻¹ *6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s.

Compute that:

2 *232e2 =464e2 =4.64e4 m⁻¹.

4.64e4 *6.626e-34 =4.64e4 *6.626e-34 =3.076e-29 J s/m * m/s.

The units: [m⁻¹] * [J s] * [m/s] = [J s/m * m/s] = J.

So E_rot =3.076e-29 J.

Wait, that's 3.076e-29 J.

p = E/c =3.076e-29 /3e8 =1.025e-37 N s.

That's way smaller than any option. So I must have made a mistake.

This is getting too complicated. I think I'm stuck and need to consider which option is closest to the calculated value for the vibrational transition, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, r=0) to the state (v=0, r=1), i.e., a purely rotational transition. Then, the energy difference is ΔE_rot = h c/(4 I ). Which we calculated as 4.12e20 J, which can't be right because that's way higher than any photon energy.

But earlier, with B=232 cm⁻¹, the rotational transition for r=1 would have E= h c * B *2 = h c * 2 * 232 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but 232 cm⁻¹ is in wave numbers, so E = h c * 232 cm⁻¹ *2.

Wait, h c is about 1240 eV nm.

Wait, 232 cm⁻¹ is 232 *100 = 23200 m⁻¹.

So E = h c *23200 m⁻¹.

h c =1240 eV nm =1240 eV *1e-9 m =1.24e-6 eV m.

But 23200 m⁻¹ is 2.32e4 m⁻¹.

So E =1.24e-6 eV m *2.32e4 m⁻¹ =2.8768e-2 eV =0.028768 eV.

Which is about 4.6e-3 eV.

Convert to joules: 0.028768 eV *1.6e-19 J/eV =4.6e-21 J.

Which is much smaller than the vibrational transition.

Wait, so the rotational transition has a lower energy than the vibrational.

So the photon's momentum would be p = E/c =4.6e-21 J /3e8 m/s =1.53e-29 N s.

But none of the options match that. So I'm really confused.

Wait, the options don't include any values in the 1e-29 range. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the question to make sure I understood it correctly.

The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the next state isn't necessarily a pure vibrational or rotational transition. Maybe the model allows for a change in both, but the next state is the one with the smallest energy difference, which could be a combination.

But without knowing the exact energy levels, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the photon's momentum is determined purely by the rotational transition, but that would require a much higher energy than the vibrational.

But given that, perhaps the correct answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns.

But earlier calculation for the vibrational transition gives 8.8e-28, which is none of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I should consider that the next state is a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the rotational transition, which requires less energy than I thought.

Wait, going back to the rotational energy calculation with B=232 cm⁻¹, the energy change for r=1 is E=0.028768 eV =4.6e-21 J.

p =4.6e-21 /3e8 =1.53e-29 N s. None of the options are close.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is in the 1e-27 J range.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again using the correct formula.

E_rot = (r(r+1) h c )/(8 I )

r=1: E_rot = (2 h c)/(8 I )= h c/(4 I )

h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

E_rot =1.9878e-25 / (4 *1.2064e-46 )=1.9878e-25 /4.8256e-46 ≈4.12e20 J.

Wait, that's the same as before, which is way too high.

So the only plausible answer is the vibrational transition, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass of the reduced mass.

Let me recalculate μ:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2 ) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

I=μ r² =3.016e-27 * (2e-10 )^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Correct.

So I'm back to the same dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for the photon's momentum as p =h/(lambda), but E=pc, so p=E/c.

Wait, but that's what I did.

Given that, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns.

But without knowing, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the calculations. But I think the correct approach is to choose the smallest ΔE, which is the rotational one, but that gives p=1.5e-29 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to calculate the rotational momentum, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the rotational energy difference using the correct formula.

Wait, rotational energy levels: E_rot(r) = (r(r+1) h c )/(8 I )

So for r=1: E_rot = (2 h c )/(8 I )= (h c )/(4 I )

h=6.626e-34 J s
c=3e8 m/s
I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

E_rot = (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(4 *1.2064e-46 )

= (1.9878e-25 ) / (4.8256e-46 )=4.12e20 J.

Again, same result. So I'm confident that my calculation is correct, but it's not matching any options.

Perhaps the question intended to ask for the rotational transition, but perhaps the numbers are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the photon's momentum is (h̄ * w ), where h̄ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, h̄ = h/(2π ). So p = E/c = (h̄ w )/c = (6.626e-34/(2π )) *4e14 /3e8.

Compute that:

6.626e-34/(2π ) ≈1.055e-34.

1.055e-34 *4e14 =4.22e-20.

Divide by 3e8:4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 N s.

Ah! That's approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Wait, that's different. So perhaps the correct approach is to use h̄ instead of h.

Because in quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized in units of h̄.

So, perhaps the momentum of the photon is calculated using h̄ instead of h.

So, photon's energy E = h̄ w.

Then, p = E/c = (h̄ w )/c = (h/(2π )) * w /c.

Which gives:

h=6.626e-34 J s
w=4e14 rad/s.

h̄ =6.626e-34/(2π ) ≈1.055e-34 J s.

E =1.055e-34 *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 N s.

Which matches option D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Ah, I see now. So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, where both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum values: \(v = 0\) and \(r = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v = 1, r = 0\)) or a rotational transition (\(v = 0, r = 1\)).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for a vibrational transition is given by:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
     \]
     where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\) is Planck's constant and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\) is the angular frequency of vibration.
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for a rotational transition is given by:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h c}{4 I}
     \]
     where \(I = \mu r^2\) is the moment of inertia, \(\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}\) is the reduced mass, and \(r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\) is the bond length.
   - The reduced mass is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu})(2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg m}^2
     \]
   - Substituting into the rotational energy formula:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4 \times 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{4.8256 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.12 \times 10^{20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The corresponding momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{4.12 \times 10^{20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.37 \times 10^{12} \, \text{N s}
     \]

3. **Comparison**:
   - The vibrational transition requires significantly less energy (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)) than the rotational transition (\(4.12 \times 10^{20} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the photon's energy must match the vibrational transition energy.

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Using the vibrational energy difference, the photon's momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{h \omega}{c} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated momentum (\(8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}\)) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem assumes the use of the reduced Planck's constant (\(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\)), the momentum becomes:
\[
p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} / 2\pi) \times 4 \times 10^{14}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}
\]
This matches **option D**.

ANSWER: D
