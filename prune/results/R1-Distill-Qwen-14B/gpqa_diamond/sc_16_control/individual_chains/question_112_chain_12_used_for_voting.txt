Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and some operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are vectors in a Hilbert space, and operators correspond to observables.

The problem says the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I should normalize this state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to have a norm of 1.

Wait, right, the norm is the inner product of the vector with itself. So the norm squared would be |1+i|² times |c1|² plus |2-i|² times |c2|², because the states |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator's matrix is given. The matrix elements Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so for a 2x2 matrix, this would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for 2x2, the diagonals are zero, and the off-diagonals are hbar/2.

So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, that's interesting. What operator does that represent? Oh, wait, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this looks like (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. Because the measurement probabilities are being asked for each eigenstate of the operator.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, because scaling doesn't change the eigenvectors. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So the operator A is proportional to sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), respectively.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. So the eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2) * (+1) = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

So the possible outcomes when measuring this operator would be hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the state in each eigenstate.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis. So to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are in the x-basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A and then compute the overlap with |alpha>.

Hmm. Let me recall that the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A are the same, because A is just a scaled version of sigma_x.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but normalized by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of measuring +hbar/2 (the eigenvalue for |+x>), I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>, square the magnitude.

Similarly for |-x>.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

Hmm, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because <up| up> is 1, and <down| down> is 1.

So (1+i) comes from <up| multiplied by (1+i)|up>, and (2-i) comes from <down| multiplied by (2-i)|down>, divided by sqrt(2) * sqrt(7).

Wait, let me compute that:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) =3.

So the inner product is (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

The square of the magnitude is (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14.

Similarly, the probability for |+x> is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. Let's compute that again.

Wait, no. Because I think I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) 

So, <up| (1+i)|up> is (1+i), and <down| (2-i)|down> is (2-i).

So (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

Divided by sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) = sqrt(14).

So the amplitude is 3 / sqrt(14).

So the probability is (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the amplitude for the other eigenstate |-x> is < -x | alpha >.

What is |-x>?

It's (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) 

So, (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + (2i) = (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2 *7) ) = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, wait, but adding the two probabilities: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. That makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, 5/14 is approximately 0.35714.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

That's close to our 0.6428 and 0.357. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but 0.6428 is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 0.3571 is approximately 0.36 as well. So the first part would match option A.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option C: 0.28, 0.72, which seems way off. So the probabilities in the first part are 0.64 and 0.36.

Hmm, but wait, the first part of the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator, so each eigenstate would have its own probability.

Wait, but A is asking for 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1, so that's correct.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of the operator A.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

So <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| sigma_x | alpha>.

Alternatively, since sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], it's the Pauli X matrix.

We can compute this expectation value.

Alternatively, since sigma_x is Hermitian, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Because for any observable, the expectation is sum (p_i * lambda_i ), where p_i is the probability of eigenvalue lambda_i.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) = [ (9 -5) hbar ]/(14 * 2 ) ) = (4 hbar )/(28) ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So looking back at the options:

Option A says the average is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

So option A would match.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. Yes, that matches.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron state |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The state is normalized to |alpha> = [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>] / sqrt(7). The operator in question has a matrix representation A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], which corresponds to (hbar/2) sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of sigma_x, denoted as |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, the overlap of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x> is computed:

1. **Probability of |+x>:**  
   < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>] / sqrt(7)  
   = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt(7)  
   = 3 / sqrt(14).  
   The probability is |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

2. **Probability of |-x>:**  
   < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>] / sqrt(7)  
   = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] / sqrt(7)  
   = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).  
   The probability is |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|² = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

To compute the average value of the operator A, the expectation value <A> is given by:  
<A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.  
Since sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the expectation value is:  
<A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9 - 5)hbar / (28) = hbar/7.

Thus, the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
