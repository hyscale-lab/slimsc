--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. They're asking for the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't live very long because it's unstable. The decay distance would be how far it travels before it decays, I think.

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, some around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So I need to calculate the mean decay length using these values.

Wait, how do you find the decay length? I remember something about the mean lifetime and the speed of the particle. Decay length is probably the product of the particle's velocity and its mean lifetime. Oh right, because distance equals velocity multiplied by time.

So, the formula for mean decay distance L is L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. And the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the mean lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right.

First, I need to find the mean lifetime τ. Once I have that, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Then multiply them to get L.

To find v, I think I need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E is given, which is the total energy of the meson. The total energy E is related to the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So, E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, actually, the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so that's the rest mass. So E = γ m c², so I can solve for γ. Then, the velocity v can be found from γ.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate γ using E = γ m c².
2. Find β = v/c, since γ = 1/√(1 - β²).
3. β can be found from γ, so v = β c.
4. Compute τ = ħ / Γ.
5. Then, L = v τ.

Wait, but units are a bit tricky here. Let me make sure about the units. Since everything is in GeV or MeV, I'll probably need to convert them into standard units like meters and seconds.

So first, let's convert E_X, m_X, and Γ_X into joules.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to work in natural units where ħ c is known. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can express things in terms of energy and velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity in terms of the energy and mass.

Let's see:

E = γ m c²
So, γ = E / (m c²)

But since E and m are given in GeV, and c² is known in (m/s)^2, but perhaps I can find γ numerically.

Wait, but let me think about the units. Let me note that 1 GeV is approximately 1.602e-10 joules. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1e9 eV: 1.602e-10 J.

So E = 8 GeV = 8 * 1.602e-10 J ≈ 1.2816e-9 J.

m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, since E=mc², so m = E/(c²). So 1.2 GeV is 1.2 * 1.602e-10 J, so m = (1.2 * 1.602e-10 J) / c².

But c is about 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s².

So m_X = 1.2 * 1.602e-10 J / (9e16 m²/s²) = (1.9224e-10) / 9e16 ≈ 2.136e-27 kg.

Wait, but maybe I can compute γ more easily. Since E = γ m c², γ is E / (m c²). But E and m are both given in GeV and GeV/c², respectively, so maybe it's unitless.

Wait, let me compute γ:

E = 8 GeV
m = 1.2 GeV/c²

So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) → but since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², let's see:

E (GeV) = γ * m (GeV/c²) * c² → units: GeV = GeV * (c² / c²) → GeV = GeV, so units work out.

So γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

So γ ≈6.6667.

Now, with γ, I can find β. The relation between γ and β is:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)

So, solving for β:

1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ² → β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)

γ is about 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444.

So 1/γ² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ approximately 0.9887.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, sqrt(0.98) is about 0.9899. 0.9775 is a bit less. Let me compute: 0.9887^2 is (0.9887)^2 = approx 0.9775. Let's see, 0.988^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + (0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. Hmm, but 0.9775 is higher than that, so maybe 0.9887 is about right.

Alternatively, maybe 0.9887 is accurate enough. So β is approximately 0.9887, so v = β c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute β more accurately.

Given γ = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So, for β, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Compute 1/γ²: (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Taking the square root of 0.9775: Let me use a calculator approach.

The square of 0.988 is 0.976144 (as before). Let's see: 0.988^2 = 0.976144.

But 0.9775 is 0.001356 higher than 0.976144.

So let me find x such that (0.988 + x)^2 = 0.9775.

(0.988 + x)^2 = 0.988² + 2*0.988 x + x² ≈ 0.976144 + 1.976 x + x².

Set equal to 0.9775: 0.976144 + 1.976 x ≈ 0.9775 → 1.976 x ≈ 0.001356 → x ≈ 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ approximately 0.000687.

So β ≈ 0.988 + 0.000687 ≈ 0.988687 → approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the next step is calculating the mean lifetime τ.

The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ.

But Γ is given as 320 MeV. So I need to convert Γ into units of energy, and then ħ is in J·s, so τ will be in seconds.

Wait, let's get the units straight.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Γ is 320 MeV. Let's convert that to joules. 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV = 320 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 J.

Calculating that: 320 * 1e6 = 3.2e8 → 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

So Γ = 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ → τ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) → τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that:

1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 / 5.1264) ) * 1e-34 + 11 → 0.2057 * 1e-23 → 2.057e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, decay length L = v * τ.

v is approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiplying these together: 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) ) * 1e8-24 → 2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let me compute that.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932, 2.966 * 0.057 ≈ approx 0.168. So total approx 6.099.

Wait, exact calculation:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483

2.966 * 0.007 = 0.020762

Sum: 0.1483 + 0.020762 ≈ 0.169062.

Total is 5.932 + 0.169062 = 6.101062.

So 6.101062e(8-24) = 6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-16 m. But looking at the options, the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, etc. So I'm getting about 6e-16. Hmm, but none of the options match that exactly. Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let's go through each step again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the energy E_X as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, no. Because in particle physics, when the production energy is given, it's usually the total energy. Because the particle is moving with some kinetic energy, so E is the total energy.

But wait, sometimes in problems, when you have a particle at rest, E is just mc², but when it's moving, E is the total energy. So I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating β, or in ħ, or in Γ.

Let me recheck the calculation of Γ in joules.

Γ is 320 MeV. 320 MeV is 320 million eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so:

320e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = (320e6) * 1.602e-19.

320e6 is 3.2e8.

3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2 *1.602) )e(8-19) → 5.1264e-11 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Then τ = ħ / Γ → 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

Hmm, that seems right.

Then v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s → 2.966e8 m/s. That seems correct.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.057) )e(8-24) → 6.101e-16 m.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, none match 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the mass in GeV/c² correctly. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the velocity in terms of c using the relativistic relation between energy and momentum.

Wait, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But then, momentum p is gamma m v, so v = (pc) / (gamma m c²) → v = (sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 )) / (E) ) * c.

Wait, let's try that.

E_X = 8 GeV, m_X c² = 1.2 GeV.

So, E² - (m c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 → 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(62.56) GeV.

sqrt(62.56) is 7.91 GeV.

So, p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, p = gamma m v → (gamma m v) = p → v = p/(gamma m).

Hmm, but gamma is E/(m c²) → 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667 → gamma is 6.6667.

So, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So,

v = (7.91 GeV/(c)) ) / ( (6.6667) * (1.2 GeV/c²) ) * c.

Wait, let me handle units carefully.

p is (GeV/c), so p = 7.91 GeV/c.

gamma = 6.6667.

m = 1.2 GeV/c².

So v = p / (gamma m) → (7.91 GeV/c) ) / (6.6667 * 1.2 GeV/c²) ) → the GeV cancels, c in denominator and c² in denominator:

(7.91) / (6.6667 * 1.2) ) * (c^2)/(c) ) → 7.91 / (8) ) * c → 0.98875 *c.

Which is the same β as before. So v is 0.98875 c, same as earlier. So no mistake in the velocity calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the decay width Γ.

Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, when calculating τ, I used Γ=320 MeV. But in particle physics, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ → so τ = ħ / Γ. So that part was correct.

Wait, but maybe the given Γ is the total decay width, so that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the decay width is given in MeV, but I should have converted it to GeV instead. Let me check.

320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So when I compute Γ in joules, yes, it's correct: 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J, as before.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using natural units, and then convert to meters.

Wait, natural units set ħ = c = 1. So, time is in inverse energy, and length is in energy^-1.

So, the mean decay length L is given by the velocity times the lifetime. In natural units, velocity is in units of c, so v = β, and time is τ = ħ / Γ → but in natural units, τ would be in (energy^-1). Since ħ has units of energy × time, but if ħ = c =1, then time is in units of energy^-1.

Wait, perhaps using natural units would simplify the calculation. Let me try.

In natural units, ħ = c = 1.

So, the width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², but in natural units, m is in GeV.

The production energy E is 8 GeV.

So, gamma is E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(400/9))) ) → sqrt(1 -9/400) = sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, beta is 0.9887.

Now, the lifetime τ in natural units is ħ / Γ → but ħ=1, so τ=1/(Γ) → 1/(320 MeV) → but to convert to seconds, we have to multiply by ħ.

Wait, no. Because in natural units, time is measured in GeV^-1, and to convert to seconds, we multiply by ħ/(c²), but perhaps it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the decay length in natural units is L = v * τ. Since v is beta, and tau is 1/(Gamma), so L = beta / Gamma, but in units of GeV^-1.

Then, to convert to meters, we need to multiply by the conversion factor from GeV^-1 to meters.

The conversion factor is:

1 GeV^-1 → ħ c / (1 GeV) → since ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm (femto meters), so 197.33e-3 GeV * 1e-15 meters.

Wait, let me compute ħ c in natural units:

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → 0.19733 GeV fm.

So, 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

So, 1 GeV^-1 → (0.19733 GeV fm) / 1 GeV ) → 0.19733 fm = 0.19733e-15 m.

So, 1 GeV^-1 = 0.19733e-15 m.

So, back to L = beta / Gamma.

Beta is 0.9887, Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So L = (0.9887) / (0.32 GeV) ) * (0.19733e-15 m / GeV^-1 )

Wait, wait, let me think again. L in natural units is (v) * (tau) → v is beta (dimensionless?), and tau is 1/(Gamma), which is GeV^-1.

So, in natural units, L = beta * (1/(Gamma GeV)) → units: (GeV^-1).

But 1 GeV^-1 is 0.19733e-15 m, as computed earlier.

So, L = (0.9887) * (1 / (0.32 GeV)) ) * (0.19733e-15 m / GeV^-1 )

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me compute:

L (natural units) = (beta) * (1/(Gamma)) → [beta is dimensionless, Gamma is in GeV].

So, L_natural = beta / Gamma (GeV^-1).

Then, to convert to meters: L = L_natural * (197.33 MeV fm) * (1e-15 m / fm) * (1 GeV = 1e3 MeV).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that 1 GeV^-1 is approximately 1.973e-16 meters.

Wait, yeah, because ħ c is about 197.3 MeV fm → 0.1973 GeV fm → 0.1973e-3 GeV m (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m). Wait, no, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 0.1973 GeV * 1e-15 m = 1.973e-16 m GeV.

So, 1 GeV^-1 = (ħ c) / (1 GeV) → which is (0.1973e-15 GeV m) ) / 1 GeV → 0.1973e-15 m → 1.973e-16 m.

So, 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 1.973e-16 meters.

So, back to L = beta / Gamma (GeV^-1) → L = (beta) / (Gamma in GeV) ) * 1.973e-16 m.

So, substituting the values:

beta ≈ 0.9887

Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So, L = (0.9887 / 0.32) * 1.973e-16 m.

Calculate 0.9887 / 0.32 → approximately 3.090.

So, 3.090 * 1.973e-16 ≈ 6.10e-16 meters.

Hmm, same result as before. So, around 6.1e-16 meters. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I messed up the production energy and mass in some way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c².

So, gamma is E/(m c²) → but since E and m c² are both in GeV, gamma is E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the width is given in MeV, but I should have converted it to GeV before using it in the formula. Wait, in the natural units approach, I used Gamma as 0.32 GeV, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the energy in the rest frame or something else. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay length.

Wait, perhaps I should use the mean decay length formula which is L = (E * c * tau) / m. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the decay length can also be found using L = (gamma * beta * c * tau) ) → since gamma = E/(m c²), beta as before.

Wait, but tau is ħ / (Gamma), and Gamma is in MeV. So, perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. My calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have that. The closest is D) 4.0655e-16 m and A)5.0223e-16 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the natural units approach is more accurate and I should compute it precisely.

Let me recompute L using natural units.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) ) → since E = gamma m, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(gamma^2 m^2)) ) → sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) → which is the same as before.

So, let's compute beta as sqrt(1 - (1.2)^2/(8)^2) ) → 1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → sqrt(0.9775) = 0.9887.

So, beta is correct.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So, L = beta * ħ c / (Gamma) → but wait, in natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, L = beta * (197.33 MeV fm) / (Gamma in MeV) ) → but wait, units:

Gamma is 320 MeV → so,

L = (0.9887) * (197.33 MeV fm) ) / 320 MeV → MeV cancels, so (0.9887 * 197.33 fm ) / 320.

Compute numerator: 0.9887 * 197.33 ≈ approx 194.8 fm.

Then, 194.8 / 320 ≈ 0.609 fm → 0.609e-15 meters → 6.09e-16 meters.

Again, same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the velocity as beta c, but perhaps the meson's velocity is non-relativistic? No, with gamma 6.66, it's highly relativistic.

Another thought: maybe the decay width is given as the total width, but perhaps the relation between Γ and τ is τ = ħ/(Γ), but sometimes, in practice, τ is ħ/(π Γ) when using the Breit-Wigner formula. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, the Breit-Wigner distribution uses Γ as the width, but the lifetime is related by Γ = ħ/(τ), but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the uncertainty principle gives Γ ≈ ħ / τ → so τ ≈ ħ/Γ.

But if the resonance is a Breit-Wigner distribution, perhaps Γ is the full width at half maximum. So, the relation would be Γ = ħ / (τ).

But wait, perhaps the correct formula is Γ = ħ / (τ). So, no, I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but let me check some references in my mind. The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. So, that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that in the calculation, I used production energy as the total energy, but perhaps the actual energy is lower. But no, the question says production energy is 8 GeV, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is given as 1.2 GeV, but perhaps it's 1.2 GeV/c², so in energy terms, it's 1.2 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, let me compute the numbers more precisely.

For beta: sqrt(0.9775) → let me calculate it more accurately.

Compute 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2.

(0.98)^2 = 0.9604.

2*(0.98)*(0.0087) = 0.0173.

(0.0087)^2 = approx 0.00007569.

Adding up: 0.9604 + 0.0173 = 0.9777 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97777569.

But 0.9775 is less than that, so perhaps beta is a bit less than 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator for sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute:

0.9775 → sqrt is approximately 0.9887.

But for precise calculation, let me use a more precise method.

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me take an initial guess of x0 = 0.9887.

Compute x^2: (0.9887)^2 = 0.97750369.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute:

9887 * 9887:

Well, but perhaps I should compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.

0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.0087 = 0.00007569.

Adding:

0.9604 + 0.008526 + 0.008526 + 0.00007569 = 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 = 0.97752769.

Wait, that's 0.97752769, which is higher than 0.9775 by 0.00002769.

So, let me adjust x to get closer to 0.9775.

Let me compute x = 0.9887 - delta.

We have x^2 = 0.97752769.

We want x^2 = 0.9775 → delta = (x^2 - 0.9775)/(2x) → (0.97752769 - 0.9775)/ (2 * 0.9887) ) → (0.00002769)/(1.9774) → approx 1.4e-5.

So, new x is 0.9887 - 1.4e-5 → 0.988686.

So, beta ≈ 0.988686.

So, v = beta c = 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, let's compute L = v * tau.

Tau is ħ /Γ → (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) → 2.057e-24 s.

So, L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24.

Multiplying 2.966 * 2.057 → Let me compute:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.057 = 0.169062.

Total: 5.932 + 0.169062 = 6.101062.

So, 6.101062e(8-24) → 6.101062e-16 m.

So, approximately 6.10e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. The closest is option A (5.02e-16) and D (4.06e-16).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Gamma to joules conversion. Let me check again.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

1 MeV = 1e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So, 320 MeV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 * 1.602e-13 → 5.1264e-11 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the decay width is 320 MeV, but the actual calculation uses the natural width without considering the energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the relativistic relation for the lifetime.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the lifetime should be calculated using the relativistic time dilation. That is, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime.

Wait, proper lifetime is τ_0 = ħ/(Γ), and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but I think I already considered that because tau = tau_0 = ħ / Gamma, because the uncertainty principle applies to the particle at rest. Hmm, but if the particle is moving, the lifetime doesn't change because the decay width is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. So, the lifetime in the lab frame is the same as the proper lifetime. So I think I did it right.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)5.0223 *1e-16 m

B)4.0655*1e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, I got 6.1e-16 m, but the closest options are A and D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c².

gamma = E/(m c^2) → but since E and m c^2 are both in GeV, gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So, E = K + m c^2 → gamma = (E + m c^2)/m c^2 → (8 + 1.2)/1.2 = 9.2 /1.2 = 7.6667.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes E is given as the kinetic energy, but in this question, it's the production energy, which is the total energy, not the kinetic.

But if I mistakenly used E as the kinetic energy, then gamma would be higher.

Let me try that approach.

If E is the kinetic energy, K = 8 GeV, then total energy E_total = K + m c^2 = 8 + 1.2 =9.2 GeV.

Then, gamma = E_total/(m c^2) =9.2 /1.2 =7.6667.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)) → gamma=7.6667, so gamma^2≈58.7778.

1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.01702.

So, beta^2=1-0.01702=0.98298 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.98298) ≈0.99146.

Then, v=0.99146 c → 2.974e8 m/s.

Then, tau = ħ / Gamma → same as before, 2.057e-24 s.

L= v * tau → (2.974e8) * (2.057e-24) = 6.12e-16 m.

Still no match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width. Or perhaps the formula uses Γ = 320 MeV, but I should have considered the natural units conversion differently.

Wait, perhaps the proper way is to compute the decay length using the formula L = (gamma * beta * c * tau), where tau is ħ / (Gamma).

Wait, but gamma beta c = gamma * beta * c.

Wait, gamma beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)) → but that's beta itself, since gamma beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)).

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula L = (gamma * beta * c) * (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the velocity as (pc^2)/E, but I think I did that already.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think about whether I have the correct formula for decay length.

Decay length L = (v) * (tau) → v is the velocity, tau is the lifetime.

Yes, that's correct. So, I think my approach is correct.

So, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is given in keV, but no, the question says 320 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute with precise calculation of beta, gamma, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the production energy is the energy of the decay products, but that would complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should compute using the decay width in the rest frame. Wait, but decay width is a frame-independent quantity. So, that shouldn't change.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 5.0223e-16 m. How did I get that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me see.

If gamma is 4.827 (as in option A?), let's see.

Wait, gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So, beta = sqrt(1 -1/(44.444)) → sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So, v=0.9887c.

Tau is 2.057e-24 s.

L=0.9887 *3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s → 0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 → 2.966e8 *2.057e-24 = 6.10e-16 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the decay width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, perhaps the correct calculation is:

L = (v) * (tau) → v = beta c = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)) * c.

Tau = ħ / Gamma → (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (0.32 * 1e9 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV) )

Wait, that's 1.0545718e-34 / (0.32e9 * 1.602e-19) → denominator: 0.32e9 *1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11.

So, tau = 1.0545718e-34 /5.1264e-11 → 2.057e-24 s.

v = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) * c → sqrt(1 - 0.0225) → sqrt(0.9775) → 0.9887 c.

So, L = 0.9887 c * 2.057e-24 s → 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 → 6.10e-16 m.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (gamma * beta * c * tau) → since gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.057e-24 s.

So, 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24.

Compute 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.6 * 0.99 → approx 6.53.

Then, 6.53 * 3e8 = 1.959e9.

1.959e9 * 2.057e-24 = approx 4.03e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4e-15 m, which is option B or C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, no. Because when you have gamma * beta, that's equal to gamma * beta = (E/(m c²)) * (v/c) → which is (E/(m c²)) * (sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ) → but perhaps I should have used gamma * beta, which is (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ) → let me compute that.

gamma * beta = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4) ) → (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) → since c^4 cancels.

So, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c².

So, (8/(1.2)) * sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) → (6.6667) * sqrt(0.9775) → 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.6 * 0.99 → ~6.53.

So, gamma * beta ≈6.53.

Then, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Tau is 2.057e-24 s.

So, 6.53 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s → 6.53 *3e8 = 1.959e9 → 1.959e9 *2.057e-24 → approx 4.03e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.03e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m) or option C (5.02e-15).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. So, which formula is correct?

Wait, the mean decay length is L = v * tau, where v is the velocity and tau is the lifetime. So, I think that's correct. But when you include gamma, because tau is the proper lifetime, but the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. Wait, no, because tau is the mean lifetime, which is the same in all frames. Because the decay width is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. So, the lifetime is the same in all frames.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

The mean lifetime is the proper lifetime, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma because of time dilation. So, the observed lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

So, the decay length is L = v * gamma * tau_0.

So, in that case, L = v * gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, that would change the calculation.

So, let me recalculate with this approach.

So, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Then, L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

So, let's compute this.

v = beta c.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6667.

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = 0.9887.

So, v = 0.9887 *3e8 m/s → 2.966e8 m/s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, L = v * gamma * ħ / Gamma.

Compute:

v = 2.966e8 m/s.

gamma =6.6667.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Gamma =0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J → 5.1264e-11 J.

So,

L = 2.966e8 m/s * 6.6667 * (1.0545718e-34 J·s) /5.1264e-11 J.

Simplify:

The J units cancel.

So,

L =2.966e8 *6.6667 * (1.0545718e-34) /5.1264e-11 m.

Compute numerator: 2.966e8 *6.6667 → approx 2.966e8 *6.6667 ≈ 1.977e9.

Then, 1.977e9 *1.0545718e-34 → approx 2.086e-25.

Divide by 5.1264e-11 → 2.086e-25 /5.1264e-11 ≈4.07e-15 m.

Ah, that's about 4.07e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m) closely.

So, the correct approach is to include the gamma factor in the lifetime, because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by gamma.

So, I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering time dilation. The mean decay length L is v multiplied by gamma multiplied by tau_0.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 4.07e-15 m, which is option B:4.0655e-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime. The velocity \( v \) is related to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) and the speed of light \( c \) by \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E \) and the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \) are related by \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \). Given \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we compute:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(6.6667\right)^2 \approx 44.444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \). The decay width \( \Gamma \) is \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Converting \( \Gamma \) to joules:

\[
\Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J/GeV} = 5.1264 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}
\]

Using \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.057 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.101 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. Reassessing the calculation, it is realized that the mean lifetime \( \tau \) in the lab frame must account for time dilation, so \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0 \), where \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \). Including this correction:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

Now, recalculate \( L \):

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.372 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

This result closely matches option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
