Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play with energy and lifetime. The principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I think the exact expression is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe it's just ħ. I might need to double-check the exact formula. Oh right, the uncertainty principle is written as ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, but sometimes people use an approximate equality for estimates.

So, the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime Δt of the state. The longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty, right? Because if a state lasts longer, we can measure its energy more precisely, so the uncertainty is smaller.

In this problem, each energy level has its own lifetime. Wait, but when we're talking about the energy difference between E2 and E1, I think the relevant factor is the uncertainty in measuring that difference. Or perhaps each state's lifetime affects their individual energy uncertainties, and then we need to consider the uncertainty in the energy difference.

Wait, maybe I should approach it this way: To distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Or perhaps each state's energy has an uncertainty, and the difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Let me think. The energy of each state has an uncertainty given by ΔE_i ≈ ħ / (2 * τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of the state i. So, for state 1 with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*τ2). 

If the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1, then for us to distinguish them, ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two energies might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart. So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, or should it be ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) / 2 or something else? Hmm, maybe I should just proceed with the formula.

Let me calculate the individual energy uncertainties first. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

The value of ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes it's easier to work in eV·s. Let me convert ħ into eV·s units.

I know that 1 eV is about 1.60218e-19 joules. So, ħ in eV·s is:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, compute ΔE1 = ħ/(2*τ1) 

τ1 is 1e-9 seconds.

So ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.

Let me compute that:

6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is (6.582 / 2 ) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582/(2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is for τ2=1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2 * 1e-8 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) eV.

That's 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.291e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8. So ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty.

So the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to be distinguishable. Or perhaps just larger than the uncertainty of the energy difference.

Wait, maybe I should think about the uncertainty in the energy difference. The energy difference ΔE has its own uncertainty, which would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties, assuming the uncertainties are independent. Because when you have two independent uncertainties, the uncertainty in the sum or difference is sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²). 

So, Δ(ΔE) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )

In this case, ΔE1 is 3.291e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

Let me calculate (3.291e-7)^2 = approx (3.29e-7)^2 = 1.08e-13.

(3.29e-8)^2 is about 1.08e-15.

Summing them gives 1.0908e-13.

The square root is sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

ΔE1 = 3.291e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 0.3291e-7 eV.

So (ΔE1)^2 = (3.291e-7)^2 = (3.291)^2 * 1e-14 ≈ 10.83 * 1e-14 = 1.083e-13.

(ΔE2)^2 = (0.3291e-7)^2 = (0.3291)^2 * 1e-14 ≈ 0.1083 * 1e-14 = 1.083e-15.

Adding them: 1.083e-13 + 1.083e-15 = 1.093e-13.

Square root of 1.093e-13 is sqrt(1.093)*1e-6.5.

Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

Because sqrt(1e-14) is 1e-7, so sqrt(1e-13) is sqrt(10)*1e-7 ≈3.16e-7.

So sqrt(1.093e-13) ≈ sqrt(1.093) * 3.16e-7.

sqrt(1.093) ≈1.045.

So 1.045 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 3.30e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 3.3e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be larger than this uncertainty to be distinguishable. So ΔE > 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-7 eV --> 0.001 < 0.033? No, not larger.

Option B: 1e-11 eV = 0.00001e-7 eV --> No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8, which is way bigger than 3.3e-7. So 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 * 1e-8 eV, which is way bigger than 3.3e-7. So yes, it's larger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01e-7 eV. 0.01e-7 is 1e-9, which is smaller than 3.3e-7, so no.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which is determined by the lifetimes of the states. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the \( i \)-th state, and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the first state (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state (\( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the uncertainty in the energy difference
The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is given by:
\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{(3.291 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (3.291 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

First, calculate the squares:
\[
(3.291 \times 10^{-7})^2 = 1.083 \times 10^{-13}, \quad (3.291 \times 10^{-8})^2 = 1.083 \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Add them:
\[
\Delta (\Delta E)^2 = 1.083 \times 10^{-13} + 1.083 \times 10^{-15} = 1.093 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Take the square root:
\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{1.093 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare the energy difference to the uncertainty
To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta (\Delta E) = 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.00001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 1 \times 10^{4} \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Final Answer:
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
