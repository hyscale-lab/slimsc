Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when particles like electrons scatter off a target, their scattering amplitude can be described using partial waves and phase shifts. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, let me think. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves, right? The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number and δ_l are the phase shifts. But wait, I'm being asked specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh right, when θ is 0 degrees, because the incident beam direction is straight ahead.

So, when θ is 0, cosθ is 1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the expression simplifies a lot. The sum becomes (1/k) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) * 1. 

But wait, the question only gives me phase shifts for certain l values. The phase shifts given are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, and δ_4=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4 here. Any higher l's are ignored as per the problem statement. 

So the formula for the scattering amplitude would be f(0) = (1/k) [ (2*0+1) e^{iδ_0} sinδ_0 + (2*1+1)e^{iδ_1} sinδ_1 + ... + (2*4+1)e^{iδ_4} sinδ_4 ].

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond the given ones, so we only consider l=0 to l=4.

Now, I'm to find the imaginary part of f(0). Let me think about the expression. Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Let me expand this. e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l = [cosδ_l + i sinδ_l] * sinδ_l = cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin²δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) i sin²δ_l. Therefore, the imaginary part of the entire sum is sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l, and then multiplied by (1/k) because f(0) = (1/k) times the sum.

Wait, but wait—the imaginary part would be (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin²δ_l for each l. Because the i is part of each term's imaginary component.

So the imaginary part Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Now, I need to compute this sum. Let me list each term:

For l=0:
(2*0+1) = 1
δ_0 = 90°, so sin(90°) = 1. So sin²(90) = 1.
Term = 1*1 = 1.

l=1:
2*1+1=3
δ_1=67°, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, so sin²= approx 0.8473. So 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2:
2*2+1=5
δ_2=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192, sin²≈0.6710. 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3:
2*3+1=7
δ_3=30°, sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25. 7 * 0.25 =1.75.

l=4:
2*4+1=9
δ_4=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4555.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419;
3.5419 +3.355=6.8969;
6.8969 +1.75=8.6469;
8.6469 +0.4555≈9.1024.

So the sum is approximately 9.1024.

Now I need to find (1/k) multiplied by this. Wait, what is k here? k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV. So I should calculate the wave number k for 50 MeV electrons.

I recall that the relativistic energy of an electron is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). But since 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass of the electron (~0.511 MeV), we can approximate E ≈ pc. So, p ≈ E/(c) ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But wait, wave number k is given by p/(ħ). So k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV c^{-1} ) / (ħ).

Wait, let's get the units right. Let me compute k in units of 1/fm because the options are in fm.

I remember that ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV fm. So 197.3 MeV fm = ħ c. So, p = E/(c) when E is in MeV. So p = 50 MeV/c.

So k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) = 50 / (ħ c) * (MeV/c) * (ħ c)/(MeV fm) ) Wait, maybe it's better to compute k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV / c) / (ħ) = (50 / ħ c) ) * (ħ c) [because MeV/c * c = MeV, and ħ is in J s, but perhaps it's easier to plug in the numbers.

Wait, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) ) = (50 MeV) / (c * ħ) ) = 50 / (197.33 MeV fm / MeV) ) ) → because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → 50 MeV / (c * ħ) ) = 50 * (1/(197.33 MeV fm)) ) * [MeV cancels] → 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that again. Since k = p/(ħ) and p = E/c when E >> m c^2.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV. But since E = pc, p = E/(c) = 50 MeV/c.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

So k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) 

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So substituting, k = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ] 
= (50/c) * [ c/(197.33 MeV fm) ) ] * MeV 
Wait, the units: MeV/c divided by MeV fm/c → Let me do the dimensional analysis.

Wait, the denominator is (ħ) which has units of J s. But perhaps using the relation in terms of MeV fm is easier.

Let me compute numerically:

Since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, then 1/(ħ) = c/(197.33 MeV fm).

So k = (50 MeV/c) * (c/(197.33 MeV fm)) ) 
= 50/(197.33) * (MeV * c) / (c * MeV fm) ) 
= 50/(197.33) * 1/fm 
≈ 0.2533 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

Now, going back to Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum(2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ≈ (1/0.2533 fm^{-1}) ) * 9.1024.

Wait, 1/k is in fm because if k is in fm^{-1}, then 1/k is fm. So 1/k is approximately 3.948 fm.

Wait, 1 divided by 0.2533 is approximately 3.948.

So Im f(0) ≈ 3.948 fm * 9.1024 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

3.948 * 9.1024 ≈ let's see:

3.948 * 9 = 35.532
3.948 * 0.1024 ≈ 0.404.
Total ≈ 35.532 + 0.404 ≈ 35.936 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about ten times larger than my estimate. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recheck.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ), right? Hmm, but sometimes I get confused between wave number and momentum. Let's make sure.

Wait, the correct relation is p = ħ k, so k = p/(ħ). Since p is 50 MeV/c, but we probably need to express p in units where ħ is in MeV fm.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ is 197.33 MeV fm / c. So, substituting p = 50 MeV/c → k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) = (50/(197.33)) (1 fm^{-1}) ), which is 50/197.33 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait a second: the sum I computed was 9.1024. So 3.948 fm * 9.1024 ≈ 35.936 fm. But none of the options are close to 36 fm. The options are in the hundreds or thousands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, but e^{iδ} sin δ = [cos δ + i sin δ] * sin δ = cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ. So in f(0), the sum of the imaginary parts is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but 1/k is in fm, and sum is unitless, so the result is in fm.

Wait, my calculation gives about 35.9 fm. But the options are much bigger. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum:

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90) = 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let's compute sin(67) accurately. 67 degrees: sin ≈ 0.9205. So squared is 0.8473. 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55). sin(55)≈0.8192, squared ≈ 0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13). sin(13)≈0.22495, squared ≈ 0.0506. 9 * 0.0506≈0.4555.

Sum: 1 + 2.5419 =3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4555=9.1024.

So sum is indeed 9.1024.

Wait, but maybe I forgot to include the (2l+1) term for each l? Oh wait, no, I included it. Because for each l, it's (2l+1) multiplied by sin^2 δ.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used the actual phase shifts, not the degrees in radians? Because in the formula, δ is in radians. Wait, no, because sin^2 δ_l would be the same regardless of the units as long as the argument is correct. Wait, no. Wait, no, because when calculating sin of an angle, it must be in radians.

Oh wait! That's a big mistake. I calculated sin(67 degrees), but in reality, the formula requires the phase shift δ_l to be in radians. So I should convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Oh no, I think I messed that up. So that's where the mistake is. Let me recalculate each term with δ_l in radians.

So for each l, convert δ_l from degrees to radians:

δ_0 = 90° = π/2 ≈ 1.5708 radians.

sin(1.5708) = 1. So sin²=1.

So term for l=0: 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: δ_1=67°. 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937) ≈ let me compute. 67 degrees is about 0.9205 in sine as before, but in radians it's the same value. Wait, no, the calculation for sin(67 degrees) is the same whether I compute in degrees or radians? No, wait, in code, sin takes radians. But in reality, the value of sin(67 degrees) is the same whether you compute it in degrees or radians because it's the same angle. Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you compute sin(67 radians), that's a very different value. But in this problem, the phase shifts are given in degrees, so I must convert them to radians before computing their sine.

Ah, right! Because the argument for the sine function must be in radians for the correct value. So let me redo each term with δ in radians.

So:

l=0: δ=90°= π/2 ≈1.5708 rad. sin^2 =1. So term is 1.

l=1: δ=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

sin(1.16937) ≈ sin(67°)≈0.9205. So squared is 0.8473. 3 * 0.8473 ≈2.5419.

l=2: δ=55° →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

sin(0.95993) ≈ sin(55°)=0.8192. Squared is 0.6710. 5 * 0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:30° → π/6≈0.5236 rad.

sin(0.5236)=0.5, squared 0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4:13° →13 * π/180≈0.22689 rad.

sin(0.22689)≈0.2252, sin^2≈0.0507. 9 *0.0507≈0.4563.

So sum is 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4563=9.1032.

So the sum is roughly 9.1032.

Wait, that's the same as before? Because the sines are the same whether I calculated in degrees or radians? No, that's not correct. Wait, wait a second. Wait, when I compute sin(67 degrees), whether I think of it as 67 degrees or 67 radians, the sine is different. Oh wait no, because I'm using the angle in degrees. Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, no. The phase shifts are given in degrees (e.g., 90°, 67°, etc.), so when computing sin(δ_l), I have to compute it as the sine of that angle in degrees, not in radians. Because if I convert to radians, I get the correct sine value, but if I think in degrees, I have to make sure that the sine function uses the correct angle measure.

Wait, but in reality, when calculating sin(67°), whether I convert 67° to radians and compute sin, or compute using a calculator set to degrees, the result is the same. So in this case, I can compute sin(67 degrees) numerically as 0.9205, regardless of whether I think in radians or not. So my initial approach was correct. So the sum is 9.1032.

Hmm, but that didn't change the sum. Then why is the answer not matching any options? Maybe I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation of k.

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ. The momentum p is given by E/c for high energies (since E=pc when E>>m c^2).

E is 50 MeV, so p = E/c =50 MeV/c.

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈ 3.948 fm.

Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum = 3.948 fm * 9.1032 ≈ 35.94 fm.

Hmm, but the options are much higher. So perhaps I missed a factor. Let's see.

Wait, the formula I used is for the scattering amplitude f(θ), which has units of fm. But sometimes, in scattering theory, the differential cross-section is related to |f|^2, but for this question, it's about the imaginary part of f(θ).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees, but that's unlikely because the question states degrees. Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to multiply by some factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the imaginary part. Let me double-check the formula.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, the standard formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Which can be written as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) 

Which becomes (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ] P_l (cosθ)

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l P_l (cosθ) 

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So my calculation was correct.

Wait, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in a different way. Let me try another approach.

The wavelength λ is given by λ = h/(p), where p is the momentum. But since p = E/c for high-energy electrons, and E = 50 MeV.

But ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ.

So λ = 2π ħ/(p) = 2π ħ c/(E).

E is 50 MeV, so λ = (2π * 197.33 MeV fm) ) / (50 MeV) ) 

Wait, 197.33 MeV fm is ħ c, so substituting:

λ = (2π * 197.33 MeV fm) / (50 MeV) ) 

= (2 *3.1416 *197.33) /50 fm 

≈ (6.2832 * 197.33) /50 

≈ (1238.44) /50 ≈24.7688 fm.

So k is 2π / λ = 2π/(24.7688 fm) ≈ (6.2832) /24.7688 ≈0.2533 fm^-1. Which matches my previous calculation.

So 1/k is 3.948 fm.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like the square of the amplitude or something else.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 in the expression for f(θ). Let me check.

Another source says that the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the effective range or something else. Hmm, maybe the phase shifts are given in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should include a factor from the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (f(0)) is related to the total cross-section (σ_tot) by Im f(0) = (1/(k)) * σ_tot.

But wait, the total cross-section σ_tot is given by the sum over all possible channels, but perhaps in this problem, it's simplified.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The optical theorem says Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) ∫ |f(k,θ)|^2 sinθ dθ.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula Im f(0) = (1/(2k^2)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ).

Wait, but I don't think that's correct. Let me think.

Wait, the expression for the differential cross-section is |f(θ)|^2 = (1/k^2) sum_{l=0}^\infty sum_{l'=0}^\infty (2l+1)(2l'+1) sin δ_l sin δ_{l'} P_l P_{l'}.

At θ=0, the sum simplifies because P_l(1)=1, so |f(0)|^2 = (1/k^2) [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ]^2.

But that's the square of the real part plus the square of the imaginary part.

Wait, but earlier, I thought f is a complex number. So f(0) = Re f(0) + i Im f(0).

But according to the formula, f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

Which can be written as (1/k) [ sum (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l ) ) + i sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ) ].

So the real part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So the calculation I did is correct.

Wait, but the options are much larger. Let me check the sum again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum, perhaps I forgot to include higher terms or miscalculated.

Wait, let me recompute each term using more precise sine values.

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90°) = 1.

l=1: 3 * sin^2(67°)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13°)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=0.4555.

Adding them up: 1 +2.5419 =3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4555=9.1024.

So sum is 9.1024.

1/k is 3.948 fm.

So Im f(0)=3.948 *9.1024= approx 35.94 fm.

But looking at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none are close to 36 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2k)) sum ... instead of 1/k.

Wait, let me check the formula again. From scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So no, it's 1/k.

Wait, but perhaps in some conventions, the amplitude is written as f = (1/(2k)) sum ... ?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k²) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, no, that would give units of fm², which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied by something else. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the imaginary part in a different way, like using the full expression including the exponential. Or perhaps the amplitude is being considered as f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l.

Wait, no, the standard formula is e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l})/(2i) ), which is perhaps where the imaginary part comes from. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a factor of (2l+1) in front, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part of this is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * Im(e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l) * P_l.

Wait, but e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of this is sin² δ_l. So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So the sum of these is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by (1/k).

Hmm, that's what I did.

So maybe the problem is that the phase shifts are given as δ_o, δ_1, etc., but in the formula, the phase shifts are actually δ_l, which might be in radians.

Wait, but that's the same approach I took earlier. So maybe the answer is supposed to be 35.94 fm, but that's not an option given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: perhaps k is in units of 1/fm, but in reality, the wave number k is expressed in units of inverse femtometers. Let me compute k more accurately.

Wait, the momentum p is 50 MeV/c.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.327 MeV fm.

So, p = 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV fm / c) ) = (50 / 197.327) (MeV/c) * (c)/(MeV fm) ) ) → MeV cancels, c cancels.

So, k = 50 /197.327 fm^{-1} ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k is about 3.948 fm.

So, back to Im f(0) ≈3.948 fm * 9.1024 ≈35.94 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I have to consider that the phase shifts may have been given in radians, not degrees.

Wait, if δ_0=90 radians, that's way too big. Because 90 radians is like 90/(2π) ≈14.33 revolutions. So that can't be. So the phase shifts must be in degrees.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the calculation should be done in radians. Let me try that.

So, converting the phase shifts to radians:

δ_0=90 degrees = π/2 ≈1.5708 radians.

sin(1.5708)=1.

l=0:1 *1=1.

δ_1=67 degrees=1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937)=0.9205.

So same as before.

Same for all others, so the sum remains 9.1024.

Hmm, no change.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, in some conventions, the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum(2l+1) sin^2 δ_l = (sum)/(2k).

In that case, my previous calculation would be multiplied by 0.5.

So, 3.948 *9.1024=35.94, then divided by 2 →17.97 fm.

Which is close to option C:177.675 fm? No, because 17.97 is not in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(k^2)) sum ... but that would change the units.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think in terms of the total cross-section.

The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k^2) Im f(0).

So, if I can compute σ_total, then Im f(0)= (k^2/(4π)) σ_total.

But wait, I don't have σ_total given, so that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is given as f= (1/(2k)) sum ... which would change the calculation.

Let me recalculate with 1/(2k) instead of 1/k.

So Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) * sum.

So 1/(2k)=3.948 / 2=1.974 fm.

1.974 *9.1024≈17.95 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) multiplied by something else.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, but that's the real part. No, because the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the modulus of the scattering amplitude, but that's not what it says.

Hmm, perhaps the options are given in units of 10^(-15) m, but no, the options are in fm, which is 10^-15 m. So 35.94 fm is 3.594e-14 m, which is roughly 36 fm.

But the options are much larger, so I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k, which would give 35.94 fm *0.2533 fm^{-1}= about 9.10 fm^2. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the phase shifts. Maybe the phase shifts given are in the form δ_o, δ_1, etc., but perhaps the l indices are starting from l=1 instead of l=0.

Wait, the problem says δ_o=90, δ_1=67, etc., so l=0,1,2,3,4.

No, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I used is for the differential cross-section, not the amplitude.

No, the formula I used is for the amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(θ) is (1/(2k)) sum ... which would make Im f(0) = sum/(2k).

So 9.1024 / (2 *0.2533) =9.1024/(0.5066) ≈17.95 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider the calculation of k. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E = 50 MeV, and calculate k as (50 MeV)/(ħ c) ) * (1 fm).

Wait, because ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so 50 MeV divided by (ħ c) gives 50 /197.33 =0.2533 fm^{-1}, which is the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads to approximately 35.94 fm, which is not among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me compute the sum again with precise values.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1, sin^2(90)=1 →1*1=1.

l=1:3, δ=67°, sin=0.9205 →(0.9205)^2=0.8473 →3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5, δ=55°, sin=0.8192 →0.6710 →5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7, δ=30°, sin=0.5 →0.25 →7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9, δ=13°, sin=0.22495 →0.0506 →9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum: 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way, such as as the real parts. Or perhaps the phase shifts are the same as the scattering angles. No, that's not correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts δ_l are the same as the scattering angle θ, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in the form of cos δ_l, but the question states it's the phase shifts themselves.

Hmm, perhaps it's time to look for another approach. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, perhaps I should multiply the sum by 1000 or something.

Wait, 35.94 fm is 3.594e-14 m. The options are much larger: like 355 fm is 3.55e-13 m. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should compute k in a different way. Let me compute the wavelength λ in meters.

Wait, E =50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

The momentum p is E/c. c=3e8 m/s.

p = (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) )= 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

k = p/ħ. ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k=2.67e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.532e13 m^{-1}.

But 1 fm =1e-15 m, so 1 fm^{-1} =1e15 m^{-1}.

So k in fm^{-1} is 2.532e13 /1e15 =0.02532 fm^{-1}.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because earlier calculation said k is 0.2533 fm^{-1}. Hmm, but this is different.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute p again.

E=50 MeV=50e6 *1.602e-13 J (since 1 eV=1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV=1e6 eV=1.602e-13 J).

So 50 MeV=50 *1.602e-13 =8.01e-12 J.

p=E/c=8.01e-12 J / (3e8 m/s) )=2.67e-20 kg m/s.

k=p/ħ=2.67e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.532e14 m^{-1}.

Now, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm^{-1}=1e15 m^{-1}.

So k=2.532e14 m^{-1} =2.532e14 / 1e15 fm^{-1} =0.2532 fm^{-1}.

Which matches the previous calculation. So no mistake there.

Wait, but then 1/k is 3.948 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c, like 197.3 MeV fm.

Wait, but that's what I used.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the intended answer is 35.94 fm, but it's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the scattering amplitude is given in terms of the differential cross-section, not the amplitude itself.

Wait, the differential cross-section is dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|^2 (2k)^2.

So, if Im f(0) is part of f(0), then perhaps the imaginary part is linked to the cross-section.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the amplitude, not the cross-section.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Given that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 355.351 fm, which is 10 times my result. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 GeV, not 50 MeV. Let me check.

If E=50 GeV, then 50 GeV =5e4 MeV. So p=5e4 MeV/c.

Then, k= (5e4 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) →5e4 /197.33 ≈253.2 fm^{-1}.

1/k=1/(253.2) ≈0.003948 fm.

Im f(0)=0.003948 *9.1024≈0.03594 fm.

Which is even smaller, so that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but when calculating sine, I should have used radians. So, for each δ_l, compute sin(δ_l in degrees) instead of radians.

Wait, that would make the sine values the same as before. So no effect on the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) instead of sin^2 δ_l.

So, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Let me try that.

So for each l:

l=0: sin(180°)=0 → term=1 *0=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3*sin(134)=3*0.6691=2.0073.

l=2:5 * sin(110°)=5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60°)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26°)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.0073=2.0073; +4.6985=6.7058; +6.062=12.7678; +3.9456=16.7134.

Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) *16.7134 = (1/(2*0.2533)) *16.7134 ≈(1.974) *16.7134≈33.08 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l (1 + cos δ_l), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin 2 δ_l.

Wait, that would be similar to the previous approach.

But earlier calculation gave about 33 fm, which is still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(2 δ_l)).

Which would be same as (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) 2 sin^2 δ_l.

So that would make it (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l) /k.

Which is the same as before.

So Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / k.

Which is the same as I calculated before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've done the calculation correctly, but none of the options match. Perhaps I should look for a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * (sin 67)^2=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506=0.4555.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4555=9.1024.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is between the wave number k and the momentum p. Or perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] / (2i k) P_l(cosθ). Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the optical theorem approach, where Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, in that case, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l would be:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin67=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin55=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13=9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455≈13.382.

Im f(0)=13.382/(k) →13.382/0.2533≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the total cross-section, which according to the optical theorem is σ_total =4π/k^2 Im f(0).

If I compute σ_total=4π/k^2 * Im f(0).

But I don't have σ_total given, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is the total cross-section divided by 4π/k^2.

But again, without knowing σ_total, can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I should just go with the calculation as is and see which option is closest.

Wait, I have Im f(0)≈35.94 fm. Looking at the options, the closest would be option B:355.351 fm. That's about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k. Let me check:

Earlier, I calculated k=0.2533 fm^{-1}.

If k were 0.02533 fm^{-1}, then 1/k=39.48 fm.

But that would make Im f(0)=39.48 *9.1024≈359.4 fm, which is close to option A (87163.4 fm) but not exactly.

Wait, no, that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, thinking in angstroms instead of fm.

1 fm=0.01 angstrom, but that's unlikely to be the case.

At this point, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 35.94 fm, but since it's not among the options, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B (355.351 fm) which is 10 times larger, suggesting I missed a factor of 10. But I can't identify where that factor would come from.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in units where the wave number k is in inverse meters instead of inverse fm. Let's see.

But that would complicate things, and I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c, such as 197.327 MeV fm.

Wait, no, I used that value.

Hmm.

After all this, I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation as I did, and perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is about 10 times my result. But I can't see where the factor of 10 comes from, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The scattering amplitude is given by:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l,
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts provided for \( l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). The phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). Higher phase shifts are ignored as per the problem statement.

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number Calculation**:
   The wave number \( k \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / \hbar \). For high-energy electrons, \( p \approx E / c \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \), we find:
   \[
   k = \frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}} \approx 0.2533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:
   The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is:
   \[
   \text{Im} \, f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l.
   \]
   Each term in the sum is calculated as follows:
   - \( l = 0 \): \( (2l+1) = 1, \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \), contribution = \( 1 \).
   - \( l = 1 \): \( (2l+1) = 3, \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.8473 \), contribution \( \approx 2.5419 \).
   - \( l = 2 \): \( (2l+1) = 5, \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.6710 \), contribution \( \approx 3.355 \).
   - \( l = 3 \): \( (2l+1) = 7, \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \), contribution \( \approx 1.75 \).
   - \( l = 4 \): \( (2l+1) = 9, \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.0506 \), contribution \( \approx 0.4555 \).

   Summing these contributions gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4555 \approx 9.1024.
   \]

   Substituting into the formula for \( \text{Im} \, f(0) \):
   \[
   \text{Im} \, f(0) = \frac{1}{0.2533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}} \cdot 9.1024 \approx 3.948 \, \text{fm} \cdot 9.1024 \approx 35.94 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated value of \( \text{Im} \, f(0) \approx 35.94 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \( 355.351 \, \text{fm} \) (Option B), which is approximately 10 times larger. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation, though the source of this factor remains unclear.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculation, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately \( 35.94 \, \text{fm} \). However, since this value does not match any of the options, and the closest option is \( 355.351 \, \text{fm} \), the intended answer is likely:

**Answer: B**
