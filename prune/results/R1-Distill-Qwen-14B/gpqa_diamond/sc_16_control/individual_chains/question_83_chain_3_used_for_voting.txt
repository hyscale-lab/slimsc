Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid.

Wait, but before that, when we dilute the acetic acid with water, its concentration changes. Let me calculate the initial concentration after dilution.

Original volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: (0.05 * 20) = 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles of acetic acid initially would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then when diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the titration. At 25% titration, that means we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point.

So, first I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid. It's 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol. So for neutralization, we need 0.001 mol of NaOH.

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So 25% titration would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. The initial volume of the solution is 40 cm³, and we're adding NaOH. So when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to 40 cm³ of the acetic acid solution, we'll have some moles reacted.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction is: each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of CH3COOH to produce CH3COO^- Na^+.

So, initially, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, this is a buffer solution, because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 2.0e-5, whose log is around 4.7. Wait, 1.85 is closer to 1.85, so let me compute log(1.85e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is around 4.733.

Wait, wait, wait: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 4.733. So pKa≈4.73.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = 4.73 + log( (0.00025) / (0.00075) )

Because [A^-] is 0.00025 and [HA] is 0.00075.

Wait, what's the ratio? 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is about -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477 ≈ 4.253. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52, option D has 4.57 and 6.92, etc.

Wait, but wait, when you add NaOH, the total volume increases. So the concentrations aren't just based on moles, but the new total volume.

Wait, let's think again. After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M, and [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) → 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. So the same as before. So the pH is 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. So the pH is around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26, which is close.

Wait, but wait, the first part of the question is 25% titration, so that's the pH, and the second part is the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the pH at equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will contain sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic. The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So to find pH, we can calculate Kb for acetate.

Given Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, the concentration of acetate at equivalence point: how much acetate is there?

At equivalence, all the 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been converted to acetate. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ (equivalence volume) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So for the hydrolysis: Kb = 5.405e-10, concentration is 0.02 M.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options seem to have 9.02. Let me recheck calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10, correct.

Concentration at equivalence point: 0.001 mol / 0.05 L= 0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02) → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= 1.04e-5 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98 → pH=9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence point pH is given as 8.52 (option A), 6.73 (option B), 7 (option C), 6.92 (option D). None match 9.02. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration at equivalence point.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the moles and volume.

Original moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

NaOH added at equivalence: 0.1 M * V = 0.001 mol → V = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. Correct.

Total solution volume at equivalence: 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³=0.05 L. Correct.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M, correct.

Hmm, then why is the calculated pH way off the options?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of Kb. Wait, wait, no, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the solution is a buffer, but at equivalence, it's a solution of a salt of a weak acid, so it's a basic solution. So I think the reasoning is correct, but perhaps the Kb is calculated wrong.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Yes, that's right.

Wait, when solving for x, maybe the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is incorrect? Because Kb is small, perhaps x is much smaller than 0.02.

So let's do the calculation without the approximation. The equation becomes x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ 1.04e-5, which is correct as earlier.

But the options' equivalence pH is much lower, like option A has 8.52, which would be a pOH of around 5.48, which would correspond to [OH-] of around 3.018e-6.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Wait, another way: since we have a 0.02 M solution of CH3COO^-.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming that x is the concentration of OH^- produced (which equals [CH3COOH]), then:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is so small, x would be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. Hmm. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution calculation is wrong. Let me double-check.

Original acetic acid: 20 cm³, 0.05 M → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

Diluted with 20 cm³ water → total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, all that is neutralized, so 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- in 50 cm³ → 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, unless I'm using the wrong Ka value. Wait, the given Ka is 1.85e-5. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.54054 * 1e-9 =5.4054e-10. Correct.

Hmm, but why the answer doesn't match any options. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the initial step after dilution is correct, but perhaps the way I calculated the equivalence point is wrong.

Wait, another approach: when you have a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point is beyond the midpoint of the buffer region, and the pH is determined by the Kb of the conjugate base, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid. So, for acetate ion:

Concentration is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, the expression is Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) → x² = Kb * (0.02) → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial part, the 25% titration.

Wait, let's think again about the 25% titration. Maybe I missed the dilution effect.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol.

After reaction, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 -0.00025= 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- =0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH= pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.73.

Ratio= (0.005882)/(0.017647)= 0.33333.

Log(0.333)≈ -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253.

Which is about 4.25. So the pH is approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, which is close.

But the equivalence point is causing a problem, because the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the solution isn't just the acetate ion. Let me think: when you have the equivalence point, you have sodium acetate, which is a strong electrolyte. So the solution is 0.02 M CH3COO^- and 0.02 M Na^+.

Wait, but sodium ions are spectator ions, so they don't affect the pH.

So the acetate ions hydrolyze as before. So I think the calculation is correct.

But none of the options have pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, let me think again about the equivalence point. Maybe I should use the formula for when a weak acid is titrated with a strong base, and the pH at equivalence is determined by the Kb of the acetate ion.

Wait, maybe I should consider the exact solution of the hydrolysis equation, not the approximation.

So the Kb expression is:

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, let's say x=1e-5. Then 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So the approximation holds.

So x ≈1.04e-5, as before.

So pH=9.02.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps another mistake in the initial dilution step.

Wait, wait, when I diluted the acetic acid. Oh! Wait, wait a second. The original problem says we dilute 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. Then we titrate that solution.

Wait, so the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration is (0.05 * 20) /40 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but when we start titrating, the volume is 40 cm³, and adding NaOH. So the calculations are correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the pH at 25% of the titration relative to the equivalence point, not relative to the initial solution.

Wait, but 25% of what? 25% of the volume needed for equivalence.

Wait, equivalence volume is 10 cm³ NaOH. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³, which is what I calculated.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm correct, but the given options don't have the correct values.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, 8.52 would correspond to a pH of around 8.52.

So let's see if perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the solution isn't just the acetate, but some other factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that when the solution is at the equivalence point, the concentration is 0.02 M acetate. So the pH is determined by the Kb of acetate.

But perhaps I'm missing activity coefficients or something, but that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence using the approximation formula for weak bases.

The formula is pH = 0.5*(pKa + pKb), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's for something else.

Alternatively, for a weak base, the pH can be calculated as:

pH = pKa + 0.5 (pKb - pKa), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's think about the hydrolysis again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C).

Which would give OH- = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5 M → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So, same result.

Hmm. So given that, perhaps the options have a mistake. But all options have equivalence pH much lower than 9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, original volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

So, after adding 20 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when you dilute a weak acid, the dissociation increases, but the initial calculations accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial solution after dilution isn't 0.025 M, but because acetic acid is a weak acid, the actual [H+] is higher. But that doesn't affect the moles, because when titrating, the moles are based on the initial concentration, which is a 0.025 M solution. So I think that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when the solution is titrated, the initial solution is 40 cm³, but when adding NaOH, the volume increases. But the calculations considered that in the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the solution isn't in a solution of 50 cm³, but perhaps I miscalculated the volume.

Wait, equivalence is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³. Correct.

Hmm. Well, given that, perhaps the correct equivalence pH isn't present in the options. But that can't be, so where's the error?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach for the equivalence point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't just the acetate, but maybe the presence of NaOH affects it? No, because at equivalence, all the NaOH has reacted.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution isn't 0.02 M, but lower.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the moles. Initial acetic acid: 20 cm³ *0.05 M =1 mmol. So 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.025 M.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 mol (since 1:1 ratio). So NaOH volume is 0.001 / 0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³.

So the total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³. Moles of acetate:0.001.

Concentration:0.001 /0.05 L=0.02 M. Correct.

So perhaps the problem is using the wrong Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Ka expression in a different way.

Wait, for the acetate ion, Kb = Kw / Ka =1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

So, the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02, but none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option B:3.17;6.73

Option C:4.73;7.00

Option D:4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps I got the equivalence point wrong because I added the NaOH to the diluted solution. Let me think, perhaps the initial volume was 40 cm³. So the NaOH is 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, but that doesn't change the calculations, because the equivalence volume is 10 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the solution after adding 20 cm³ of water, but before. No, the question says we diluted first.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the answer is option A, with the pH at 25% being 4.26 and equivalence at 8.52. But according to my calculations, the equivalence pH is 9.02, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the concentration of acetate and using the formula for a weak base.

The formula is pH = pKa + pKa2, but no, that's not right.

Wait, the pH when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So the steps are correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the solution is not just the acetate, but perhaps the solution also includes some other ions, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given Ka is incorrect in the problem. Wait, no, the problem states Ka=1.85e-5.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the answer is option A, because the 25% titration pH is 4.26, which matches my calculation. But the equivalence point is 9.02, which is not among the options. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution isn't at the equivalence point, but the problem statement says 'at equivalence point', so I have to find it.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression.

The Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

Thus, x = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11 )=1.04e-5.

Which gives pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the initial dilution.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps when I diluted the acetic acid, I should have considered the dilution factor correctly.

Wait, the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, the moles are 0.001, volume is 50 cm³, so 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the solution at equivalence is half the concentration, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using exact expressions without approximation.

So, Kb =x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x):

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation. Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 → approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] /2.

We take the positive root: (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 ≈3.2875e-6.

Wait, but that's bigger than our initial approximation. So [OH-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! Now that's matching option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, wait, so why did this happen? Because the initial assumption that x is negligible isn't valid? Let me check:

If x=3.2875e-6, then 0.02 -x= ~0.01999967, which is almost 0.02, but perhaps the approximation was slightly off.

So why did the previous calculation give x=1.04e-5, but solving the quadratic gives x=3.2875e-6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.

Wait, let me re-do the quadratic calculation.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 → (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approx 4.324e-11, since 2.921e-19 is negligible.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] / 2 → (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 ≈3.2875e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, so why did the initial approximation give a different result? Because when x is not negligible compared to 0.02, the approximation isn't valid. Wait, 3.2875e-6 is 3.2875e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2 → 3e-6 is much smaller than 2e-2, so the approximation should hold. So why is the quadratic solution giving a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in algebra.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

But wait, perhaps I should have considered that the equation is:

x² = Kb * C → x² =5.405e-10 *0.02 →1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So why does the quadratic method give a different result?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Wait, the equation is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10 → x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

So x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=6.575e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6]/2.

The positive root is (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 =3.2875e-6.

Wait, but that's 3.2875e-6, which is 3.2875e-6 → [OH-]=3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So that matches option A's equivalence point pH of 8.52.

Hmm. So why did the initial approximation with x=1.04e-5 give a pH of 9.02, which doesn't match, but the quadratic solution gives pH=8.52, which does match option A.

So perhaps the initial approximation isn't valid here, and the exact solution is necessary.

Wait, but why does the quadratic solution give a different result than the approximation? Because in reality, x is not that small compared to 0.02.

Wait, x=3.2875e-6 → 3.2875e-6 is 0.00032875% of 0.02, which is 0.02 M. So in that case, x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. So why is the quadratic solution giving a different result?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when I took the square root. Let me recalculate the square root of 4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is 4.324 x 10^-11.

Square root of 4.324 is approximately 2.08, and square root of 1e-11 is 1e-5.5 → 3.16e-6.

So 2.08 *3.16e-6 = approx 6.58e-6. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, so the correct [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6, leading to pH=8.52.

So, in that case, the equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

So earlier, I think I made a mistake by using the approximation that x is negligible, but in reality, even though x is small, the quadratic solution gives a lower x, leading to a lower pH.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when x is smaller, [OH^-] is smaller, so pH is higher. Wait, no, wait. [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Wait, but the initial approximation gave [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So the quadratic method gives a lower [OH^-], which makes sense because when x isn't negligible, the denominator (0.02 -x) is smaller, leading to a larger x? No, because in the quadratic solution, x is 3.2875e-6, which is smaller than 1.04e-5.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the quadratic solution gives x=3.2875e-6, which is less than the approximation of 1.04e-5. So, wait, that can't be right. Because when we approximate, we assumed 0.02 -x =0.02, leading to x=1.04e-5. But if x is actually 3.2875e-6, then the approximation overestimated x. So why did the quadratic solution give a lower x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me re-express the equation.

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → x²= Kb (0.02 -x).

So x² + Kb x - 2 Kb =0.

Wait, no, no. Wait, x² = Kb * (0.02 -x).

So x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Wait, in this case, Kb=5.405e-10.

So equation is x² +5.405e-10 x - (0.02 *5.405e-10 )=0.

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root:

x= (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈3.2875e-6.

Wait, so [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So, in this case, the quadratic solution gives a lower x, which makes sense because when you account for x in the denominator, the actual x is smaller.

Wait, but then why did the approximation give a higher x? Because in the approximation, we set 0.02 -x=0.02, so x= sqrt(Kb *0.02)=1.04e-5, which is higher than the exact solution. So the exact solution is more accurate.

So, the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, which rounds to 4.26, matching option A's first value.

So, the correct answer is option A: 4.26;8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. The moles of NaOH required for equivalence are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH for equivalence} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume corresponds to:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After the reaction, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x\) is much smaller than 0.02, so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) is \(3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), so the pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
