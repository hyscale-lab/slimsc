Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. We know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. 

The stars are interesting. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radius as Planet_1's host. 

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. We're given four options about which planet is preferred and the probability ratio.

Hmm. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The transit probability formula I think is something like (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?), where a_planet is the semi-major axis (so the orbital radius). 

Wait, more accurately, the probability P is approximately equal to (R_star / a) where R is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. No, wait, that can't be right because the actual probability involves the inclination of the orbit. Since the RV method tells us the minimum mass, the inclination is known because the RV method relies on the Doppler shift which depends on the sin of the inclination angle. So if the RV method can determine the mass accurately, perhaps the inclination is known, making the probability of transit more certain?

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on the sine of the inclination. If the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), which is when a transit would occur, the mass is the actual mass. But if it's less than 90, the mass is a lower limit. Since these planets have already been detected via RV, which implies that their masses are known, meaning that their inclinations are probably close to 90 degrees, so the probability of transit is higher. But wait, the question is about the probability of transiting, so perhaps the actual transit probability formula comes into play here.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_*/a), where R_*/a is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius. But wait, no, I think it's more precise than that. The formula I remember is P = (R_* / a) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ), but wait, no, that might not be right. Or maybe it's (R_*/a) * (something else). Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_* / a) * (1 / sin i), but wait, no. Let me think more clearly.

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that, from our point of view, the planet passes directly in front of the star. The formula is roughly (R_*/a) * (1 / sin i), but wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, the probability is (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) ), but that seems off. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up some parts.

Wait, I think the transit probability without knowing the inclination is (R_*/a) * (1 / cos i), but no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the probability of a transit is (R_* / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_*)), but that's when considering the depth of the transit. No, wait, the transit probability is just the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough that it crosses our line of sight. The formula is (R_* / a) multiplied by (some function of the argument), but I can't recall exactly.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_*/a), assuming that the star's position is uniform in the sky. Because the cross-section for the transit is a circle with radius R_star, and the area where the planet must be for a transit is a circle of radius a. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2, but that would be if the star's position is considered. Wait, no, that's the area of the star over the area of the orbit. So the probability P = (π R_*²) / (π a²) ) = (R_* / a)^2. But wait, I think I might be mixing things up. No, that doesn't seem right because the transit probability isn't necessarily the square of that ratio.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability of a transit (assuming random orientation of the orbit) is (R_* / a). Because the condition for transit is that the planet's orbital plane is within an angle θ of our line of sight, where θ is approximately R_* / a. The area where the inclination is favorable is proportional to θ, so the probability is θ = R_* / a.

Wait, yes! I think that's correct. The transit probability is approximately (R_*/a) when a >> R_*, which is usually the case. So the probability P = (R_*/a).

But wait, the RV method tells us the mass, and for RV, the semi-amplitude K depends on (M_planet sin i)/(M_star^(1/3)), etc. So if a planet is detected via RV, that gives information about the minimum mass, but for the purpose of transit probability, we need to know the actual inclination. Because if the RV method determines that the inclination is 90 degrees, then the probability of transit is higher because the orbit is edge-on.

Wait, but the question says both planets have the same masses. So their minimum masses are the same because same planet masses, but the orbital periods are different. The host star of Planet_1 is more massive (twice as much as Planet_2's host), but both stars have the same radius.

So, the question is about the transit probabilities, given their orbital periods, the host star masses, and same radii.

Since transit probability is based on (R_*/a), but we need to compute a (orbital radius) for each planet.

We can use Kepler's third law to find the semi-major axis. Kepler's law is (a^3)/(T^2) = G(M_star) / (4π²). So a^3 = [G M_star T²]/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * T²)^(1/3).

Since the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's, T_1 = T_2 / 3.

So let's write a_1 and a_2:

a_1 = [ (G M1 T1²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

a_2 = [ (G M2 T2²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

But M1 is twice M2 (since M1 = 2 M2).

So, substituting:

a_1 = [ G (2 M2) (T2/3)^2 ]^(1/3 ) / (4π²)^(1/3 )

a_2 = [ G M2 T2² ]^(1/3 ) / (4π²)^(1/3 )

Divide a_1 by a_2:

a_1/a_2 = [ (2) * (T2²/9) ) / (1) * T2² ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the numerator inside the cube root:

2 * (T2²)/(9 T2²) ) = 2/9.

Wait, no, the entire expression inside is (2 M2) * (T1^2) / (M2 * T2^2) ) because T1 = T2/3.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write a ratio.

a_1 = [ (2 M2) * (T_2/3)^2 ]^(1/3 ) * [other constants same for both a1 and a2].

So, a_1 = [2 * (T2²/9) * M2 ]^(1/3 ) 

Similarly, a_2 = [ M2 * T2² ]^(1/3 )

So a_1 / a_2 = [ (2 * (1/9) ) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) 

= [2/(9)]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 is approximately 0.606 times a_2.

Wait, but that's a_1 is smaller than a_2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (T_1 = T2/3), so if the star is more massive, a smaller planet orbit (closer in) would have a shorter period.

Wait, no, because for a more massive star, the same period would correspond to a smaller a. But with T1 being shorter, a is even smaller.

So, now, the transit probability for each planet is P1 = (R_*/a_1) and P2 = (R_*/a_2), since both stars have the same radius R_*. 

So P1/P2 = (R_*/a_1) / (R_*/a_2) ) = (a_2)/(a_1).

Since a_1 is 0.606 a_2, then a_2/a_1 is about 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. That would mean that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio.

Let me re-express the a_1 and a_2 ratio.

We have a_1 = [ (2 M2) * (T2²/9) ]^(1/3 ) 

a_2 = [ M2 * T2² ]^(1/3 )

So a_1/a_2 = [ (2 * (T2²/9)) / (M2 T2²) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (M2 T2²)^(1/3) ) ] ?

Wait, no, perhaps better to write the ratio a_1/a_2:

(a_1)/(a_2) = [ (2 M2 (T2/3)^2 ) ]^(1/3) / [ (M2 T2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 * M2 * (T2² / 9) ) / ( M2 * T2² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 = 0.606 a_2.

Thus, the transit probability for P1 is (R_*/a_1) = (R_*/ (0.606 a_2)) ≈ 1.648 (R_*/a_2).

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Thus, P1/P2 = 1.65, so Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That seems correct.

Wait another thing: but earlier I thought the transit probability is (R_*/a). But is that the case when the inclination is known?

Wait, no. Because the RV method determines the mass, which depends on sin i. If the RV method has detected the planet, that implies that the inclination is such that sin i = M_actual / M_min. Wait, no, the RV method gives M sin i. If we have M sin i, and we know M (the planet's mass is same in both cases), then sin i must be known. But in reality, the RV method doesn't give the inclination directly, but if the planet's mass is the same, the minimum mass is M sin i. So if M sin i is the same for both planets, but their M is same, then sin i is same.

Wait, but the question says both have same masses, so M_planet is same. So M sin i is same for both, but they are detected via RV, so perhaps the inclinations are same. Or perhaps, the RV method gives minimum masses, so M sin i = M_min. So if both planets have same M, and same M_min, then sin i is same. Therefore, the actual inclination angles would be same. That would affect the transit probability because the transit probability is higher when the inclination is higher (closer to 90 degrees).

Wait, this complicates things. Because if the RV method yields the same M sin i for both planets, and their masses are same, then sin i is same. So i is same for both.

Wait, but the RV method gives M sin i. So if M_planet is same, and M sin i is same, then sin i is same. So i is same for both planets. Therefore, the transit probability would depend on (R_*/a) multiplied by sin i, perhaps? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the probability that the planet transits is (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star/M_planet)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not so sure.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability when considering the RV method's constraints is P = (R_*/a) * (1 / sin i). But wait, that can't be right because if sin i is 1 (edge-on), it's 1, but if it's 0, P is zero. But I think I might be mixing up the parameters.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_*/a) if the orbit is randomly oriented. But when considering RV constraints, which gives sin i, the transit probability might be (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 - sin_i²)^(1/2)) ). No, that sounds complicated.

Wait, perhaps the actual transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - sin² i)), but that's getting into trigonometry.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is (R_*/a) / sin i. Hmm.

Wait, let me think differently. If a planet's orbital inclination is i, then the probability of transit is (R_*/a) * (1 / sin i). Because when sin i is 1 (edge-on), that's the maximum probability, and when it's lower, the probability decreases.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because for edge-on (i=90 degrees), sin i is 1, so the probability would be R_*/a. For lower i, the probability would be higher? That can't be. Wait, no, lower i would mean less likely to transit. So perhaps the formula is (R_*/a) / sin i. So when sin i is 1, it's R_*/a. If sin i is 0.5, then it's 2 times higher. But that doesn't seem right because as the orbit becomes more edge-on, the probability increases, not decreases.

Wait, perhaps the correct probability is (R_*/a) / (1 / sin i), so (R_*/a) sin i. Because for edge-on, sin i is 1, which gives maximum probability.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find a better approach.

The transit probability for a planet is the probability that, from our point of view, the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The RV method gives us sin i, so we can calculate i. So for each planet, we have sin i = M_planet sin i / M_planet = (M_min) / M_planet. But since M_planet is same for both, sin i is same for both. So the transit probability for each is (R_*/a) * (1 / sin i), but wait, no, because transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - sin² i))) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - sin² i))) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 - sin² i)) ), which would be (R_*/a) * (1 / cos² i). That seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / cos i), but that would be for a specific inclination. Wait, this is getting too complicated, and I'm not confident about the exact formula.

But in the given question, the RV method has already detected the planets, so perhaps the RV method allows us to determine the true mass (if sin i is 1), but in reality, since the RV method only gives a minimum mass, unless the inclination is known. Wait, but the question says both planets have the same masses, which suggests that their true masses are same, but the RV method's minimum masses would be M sin i. So, if both planets have same true mass, and same M sin i, then sin i must be same for both. So their inclinations are same.

Therefore, the transit probability for each planet would be the same as (R_*/a) multiplied by 1/sin i. So, since sin i is same for both, the ratio P1/P2 would be (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Wait, because (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Wait, so if a2 is larger than a1, then P1 would be larger than P2, because (a2/a1) is greater than 1. So in our earlier calculation, a1 is about 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

Thus, P1 = (R_*/a1) = (1 / 0.606) (R_*/a2) ≈ 1.65 (R_*/a2) = 1.65 P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. Therefore, the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability by about 1.65 times.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula and the given parameters. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are detected via the RV method, their inclinations are constrained, and the transit probability depends on the orbital radius \( a \).

### Key Information:
1. **Planet Properties**:
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3} \), meaning its orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), but both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)).

2. **Orbital Radius Calculation**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* T^2 \), the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( (M_* T^2)^{1/3} \). Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 T_1^2}{M_2 T_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot T_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbital radius is smaller than Planet_2's.

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius, the ratio of transit probabilities is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
   \]
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the calculations, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting due to its smaller orbital radius and shorter orbital period. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

### Correct Option:
C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
