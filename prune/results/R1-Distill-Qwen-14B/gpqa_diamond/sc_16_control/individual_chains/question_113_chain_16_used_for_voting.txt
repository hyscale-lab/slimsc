Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different formulas, and I have to use the information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec to determine the correct one. Let me think through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The fact that it's a broad peak makes me think it's an -OH group because those tend to be broader due to hydrogen bonding. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something like conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an ester or possibly an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like an aromatic ester or ketone. Or maybe an amide? But wait, the options don't seem to have nitrogen, so probably not an amide. So possible groups are ketone, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has an alkene group. Oh, so the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond. That rings a bell for something like an ester with a double bond nearby, maybe a conjugated system.

Looking at the Mass Spec data, the fragment peak is at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments would give a mass of 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but also larger ones. 45 is the mass for a fragment like CH3CO (methyl ketone) since CH3CO is 45 (12*2 +1*3 +16= 45). Or maybe a carbonyl group plus something. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but that's 91. Hmm, another possibility is the acylium ion, which would be (CH3CO+) at 45 as well. Or maybe a carboxylic acid losing water? Wait, the molecular weight for 45 is also (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but that's 58. Wait, no, acetone is (propan-2-one), molecular formula is C3H6O. Wait, but the fragments don't have to be the molecular formula. So other possibilities: could be a CH2COOH losing something? Or perhaps the fragment is from an ester.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a ketene ion or maybe a smaller fragment. Alternatively, maybe the base peak is from a CH2=CH-O- group, but not sure. Another approach: the molecular formula of the compound. Let's look at the options again:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So each option has varying numbers of hydrogens and oxygens. Let's think about the possible functional groups. The IR has a carbonyl, so maybe ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc. The broad peak suggests an -OH group, which would be in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is even broader and stronger. But sometimes esters don't have O-H unless it's an acid. So the presence of a broad peak suggests an -OH group, which points towards either a hydroxyl (alcohol) or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the carbonyl in the IR is at 1700 and 1650. Carboxylic acids usually have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which could be broad. Wait, but the FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. But then the IR would also show a carbonyl around 1700. Alternatively, an ester would have a carbonyl around 1700-1750, and maybe a conjugated system could lower that to 1650? Or perhaps it's a ketone and an ester or something else.

Wait, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, so maybe an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a conjugated system, which could lower the carbonyl stretch to around 1650. So the IR at 1700 might not be the carbonyl; wait, no, 1700 is higher than 1650. So perhaps one peak is from an ester carbonyl (around 1700) and another is from something else, maybe a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is another functional group, like an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, but the question doesn't mention any aromatic protons in the NMR, but it does mention vinyl, which are alkenyl.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula. Let's think about the degree of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation can help. Let me recall: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X (halogens) or N mentioned, let's compute for each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Two DoU, maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10)/2=2, same as B. Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: same as A, (14-12)/2=1.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one DoU from a double bond. So the DoU must be ≥1. All options have DoU ≥1 except maybe, no, all have DoU ≥1.

But the IR shows a carbonyl, which is another DoU (either a ring or a double bond or a triple bond). So the DoU for the compound should be at least 2, because one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond.

Wait, let me think. The IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and an aromatic ring (which is a ring, another DoU). Let's see.

If the compound has a carbonyl (DoU=1), a double bond (DoU=1), and maybe another ring or another double bond.

Wait, maybe the FTIR is indicating two different carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and something else, like a conjugated double bond.

Wait, the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests an -OH group. So perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very strong and broad. Then the carbonyl would be around 1700. But the other IR peak is 1650, which could be from an aromatic ring if the compound is something like benzoic acid, but that's C7H6O2, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOR, which would have a carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond might cause a peak around 1650. But wait, the 1650 peak could also be an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an ester, but that seems unlikely given the options.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that's a possibility.

Alternatively, considering the mass spec fragment. A fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible structures. 45 is a small mass, so perhaps a common fragment. Let's think about the possible formula. 45 could be C3H6O2? No, because (3*12)+(6)+(16*2)= 36 +6 +32=74. Wait no, 45 is the mass, so the formula would be something that adds up to 45.

Let me think: 45 can be (CH3)2CO which is acetone, molecular formula C3H6O. Acetone's molecular weight is 58, but a fragment could be 45. Or, perhaps the fragment is an acetyl group (CH3CO-) which is 43, but maybe with an extra O or something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown. Looking for common esters. Let's say it's an ester with a double bond.

Wait, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me think about which one can have both an ester group (so O2) and a double bond.

Option A: C6H12O2. That's 6 carbons, 12 H, 2 O. An ester would account for two O's (R-O-CO-O-R). Wait, no, wait, an ester is RCOOR', which has two O's. So that fits. So the formula could be an ester with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, but also the IR has a carbonyl. So the compound could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a conjugated system, so the carbonyl peak would be around 1650 or 1700. But wait, the IR has peaks at both 1700 and 1650, which could be two different carbonyls or a conjugated one and another group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that would require more than two oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. But then the structure would be cyclic, which could affect the NMR and IR.

Wait, another point: the FTIR has a very broad peak at ~3000, which is likely an -OH. So the molecule has an -OH group. So possible options would be an alcohol and an ester, or a carboxylic acid and an ester. Wait, but the options don't include any with three oxygen atoms. Let me check the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. So two O's.

So if it's an ester and an -OH, that would be O from ester (two O's) and another O from -OH? Wait, that can't be. Because ester is O in the carbonyl (O from the RCOO group). Wait, no. The ester has two oxygen atoms in the structure: R-O-CO-O-R'. No, wait, no. Wait, no, an ester is RCOOR', which has two oxygen atoms: one in the carbonyl (O from COO), and the other in the OR' group. So the ester group contributes two O's. So if the molecule also has an -OH group, that would make three O's, but the options don't have any with three O's. So that can't be. Therefore, the broad peak at 3000 in IR must not be from an -OH. Wait, but then what else gives a broad peak around 3000?

Wait, another possibility: maybe an amine? But the options don't have nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons show up around 9-10 ppm in NMR, but in IR, the aldehyde's stretching is around 2820 and 2720, but maybe that's not the case. Or, perhaps it's an alcohol O-H, but that would require another O in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → 6 C, 12 H, 2 O.

B) C6H10O → 6 C, 10 H, 1 O.

C) C6H10O2 → 6 C, 10 H, 2 O.

D) C6H12O → 6 C, 12 H, 1 O.

So if the compound has an -OH group, that would require an O, so the formula should have at least one O. So options B, C, D have at least one O, and A has two.

Wait, but earlier I thought the broad peak at 3000 is an -OH. So if the formula is, say, option C: C6H10O2. That has two O's. So perhaps one O is from an ester (O in COO) and another from an -OH. But wait, that would make three O's in the molecule. No, because in an ester, there are two O's in the ester group. So for RCOOR', the RCOO group contributes two O's.

Wait, no, RCOOR' is R-C(=O)-O-R'. So the carbonyl O and the ester O. So that's two O's. If the molecule also has an -OH group, that's three O's. But none of the options have three O's. So that can't be. Therefore, the broad peak in IR isn't an -OH. Hmm, so what else gives a broad peak around 3000?

Wait, maybe it's an N-H stretch, but the options don't have nitrogen. So that's out.

Another possibility: a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, no, that's a different region. Oh, wait! Maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes have a strong absorption around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1, but they can sometimes appear as a sharp peak, not a broad one. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a C-H stretch from an aromatic ring, but that usually is around 3000-3100, but those are usually less intense and not broad. Wait, but if the ring is conjugated, maybe the C-H stretches are more intense and broader? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps the structure is something like an ester with a conjugated double bond, which would have a carbonyl and a double bond, and maybe an ester group. So the IR peaks would be around 1700 (ester carbonyl) and 1650 (conjugated double bond). But then what about the broad peak at 3000? Maybe that's from the vinyl hydrogens? No, vinyl protons in NMR are around 4.5-7 ppm, but in IR, the C-H stretching for alkenes is around 3020-3100 cm-1, which is in the range of the broad peak. Oh! So perhaps the broad peak is the sp² C-H stretch of the vinyl group. That makes sense. So the broad peak is from the alkene's C-H, which is sp² hybridized. So no -OH group, but just an alkene. Then, the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 would be from the carbonyl (ester) and perhaps another carbonyl or conjugated system.

Wait, but I thought the 1700 and 1650 peaks are both carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond. Let me think. Conjugated double bonds in alkenes can cause a peak in the 1650 region. So the IR peaks would be:

- 1700: ester carbonyl (C=O).
- 1650: conjugated double bond (C=C).
- 3000: sp² C-H stretch.

That fits. So the molecule has an ester group and a conjugated double bond, leading to the two peaks in the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is the alkene's C-H stretch, not an -OH.

So, the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond. So the structure could be something like CH₂=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester or another arrangement.

Now, the Mass Spec: fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass for an acylium ion, which is a positively charged carbonyl group. For example, CH3CO+ (acetyl group) has a mass of 43, but wait, 43 is the mass of (CH3CO)+. Oh wait, 45 is the mass of (CH2CH2O)+? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment that includes an ester group. Let me think of the possible molecular formulas.

The molecular formula options are:

A) C6H12O2 → M = (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72+12+32= 116.

C) C6H10O2 → M = 72 +10 +32= 114.

So if the molecular weight is 116 (A) or 114 (C), and the fragment is 45, that would be a relatively large fragment. But in mass spec, the most abundant fragment is often the molecular ion, but sometimes the base peak is a fragment.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. If a fragment has a mass of 45, that would be 114-45=69, which is the other part. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from losing a part of the molecule. Let's think: if the molecule is an ester with a conjugated double bond, perhaps the mass spec breaks the ester into a carbonyl group and an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps cleavage occurs at the double bond.

Wait, another possibility is that the fragment at 45 comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Maybe the ester breaks into the acetyl group (CH3COO-) and something else. Wait, the acetyl group would be (CH3COO-) with a mass of about 60 (12*2 +16*2 +1*3), but that's 45 (12*2 +16 +1*3) = 24 +16 +3=43? Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of an ethyl group (29) from the molecule. Alternatively, maybe the base peak is from the tropylium ion, but that's 91.

Alternatively, could the fragment be from the cleavage of the ester into an acid and an alcohol? For example, the ester group could break into RCOO- and R'OH. But I'm not sure how that would give a mass of 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be the acetyl group (CH3CO+) which is 43. But the peak is at 45, so 45 is 43 plus 2. Hmm, maybe it's a different fragment. Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group, leaving behind something else. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (a hexyl acrylate), the mass would be higher, but the fragment could be the acrylate part.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options again. The options are four with varying H and O counts.

The FTIR suggests an ester (based on 1700 cm^-1) and a conjugated double bond (1650 cm^-1) along with the sp² C-H (3000 cm^-1).

The NMR has vinyl protons, so the compound has an alkene.

The mass spec has a peak at 45. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

Option A: C6H12O2. M=116. The possible fragments: maybe losing a part of the molecule. For example, if the molecular ion is 116, losing 71 would give 45, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe a fragment is the acetyl group (43), but that's close to 45. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2CH2O) which is 44. Not matching. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. M=114. So the fragment at 45 could be a part of the molecule. Let me think: 114-45=69. What's 69? Maybe a propyl group (57), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2=CHCO) which is 57. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH2CH2O) which is 44, which is close but not exactly 45. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH2CH2O)+ with an extra O, but that would be 46.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an ethyl group (29) plus a methyl ketone (43), but that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a cyclic structure. For example, if the molecule is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Breaking the ring could release a fragment. Let's say the ring is five-membered; breaking it might give a fragment with 45. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, the loss of the R-O- group in the ester (RCOOR'), leaving RCO+ which is the acylium ion. The mass of RCO+ would be the molecular weight of RCO. For example, if R is methyl (CH3), then RCO is CH3CO, which is 43. But the fragment is 45. Hmm, not matching. Could R be ethyl? Then RCO would be CH2CH2CO, which is 57, which is higher than 45.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment is from a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure RC=O, and its ion would have a mass equal to the molecular weight of RC=O plus a charge. The mass of (RC)=O would be (12 +16) + (H's). Wait, maybe not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ethylene group. But ethylene is 28, which is lower than 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a ketone group. For example, if the molecule has a ketone, the loss of the ketone would leave a fragment. But wait, the IR indicates an ester, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the result of the molecule breaking into two parts, one of which is 45. So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the fragment 45 would require (let's calculate) 45 corresponds to (x C, y H, z O) where 12x + y +16z =45.

Looking for combinations:

Possible:

- x=2, y=3, z=2: 24 +3 +32 =59 → too high.
- x=3, y=3, z=0: 36 +3=39 → too low.
- x=2, y=5, z=1: 24 +5 +16=45 → yes! So 2 C,5 H,1 O: C2H5O.

Which would be HOCH2CH2+? Or something else. Wait, molecular formula C2H5O has a molecular weight of 45. What structures correspond to C2H5O? It's CH3CH2O+, which is an ethoxy group. Or maybe it's CH2=CH-OH (but that's 46). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is (CH3CO)+, which is 43. But the peak is at 45, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH2O)+, which is 44, but again, doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2CH2O) with an extra O, but that would make 46.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a different part of the molecule. Suppose the compound is an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H14O2, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps it's a smaller molecule.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the options and see which one could have a fragment at 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If the molecular ion breaks into two parts, maybe 45 and 71. 45 could be a fragment of the ester group. For instance, if the ester is an ethyl group (C2H5O), which is 45 (C2H5O isn't exactly 45, since C2H5O is 45? Let me calculate: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Yes. So the fragment could be the ethoxy group, (C2H5O)+, which is 45. So if the ester is of the form RCO-O-C2H5, then losing the RCO group would leave the ethoxy group as a fragment. So in the mass spec, you would see a peak at 45.

So if the formula is C6H12O2, which is option A, and the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), which has the formula C6H10O2. Wait, but option A is C6H12O2. Hmm, wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2, which doesn't match. So perhaps a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (which is option C). Wait, but the mass spec peak is 45, which is the ethoxy group, which would fit with an ethyl ester.

Wait, but if the formula is C6H12O2, that's 6 carbons, 12 H, 2 O. If it's an ester with a double bond, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that might not fit the H count.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a branched ester. Let me think: if the ester is something like CH2CH2COOCH(CH2CH3)2. Hmm, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is an ester with a double bond, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would have 5 carbons: 2 from CH2=CHCO, 3 from CH2CH2CH3. So total 5+3=8, but the formula is C6. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl ester. For example, vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH=CH2. Its formula is C4H6O2. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more complex. Let me think again. The mass spec peak at 45 suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (C2H5O), which is 45. So if the ester is an ethyl ester, then the fragment would be the ethoxy group.

So, the ester would be of the form RCOOCH2CH3. Then, when the ester breaks, the ethoxy group would be a fragment. So in the mass spec, the peak at 45 (C2H5O) would be present.

So, looking at the options, which have O2 and can form an ethyl ester.

Option A: C6H12O2. So if the ester is ethyl, then the RCOO part would be C5H10O2 - but wait, no, the RCOO would be from the acid. For example, if the acid is RCOOH, then the ester is RCOOCH2CH3. So the R group would be C4H9 (if the acid is pentanoic acid, but wait, the molecular formula would need to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That would be C5H8O2. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but the options are for the entire compound. So if the compound is an ester with formula C6H12O2 and it's an ethyl ester, then the acid part would be C5H10O2. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester of a carboxylic acid with a structure that includes a double bond. For example, the acid could be pentenoic acid, and the ester could be ethyl pentenoate. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. That would be C6H10O2, which is option C. Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCH2COOCH3 is C6H10O2. So the molecular formula matches option C.

In this case, the mass spec would fragment to produce the ethoxy group (if it's an ethyl ester), but wait, in this structure, the ester is methyl, not ethyl. So the OCH3 group would have a mass of 49 (15 + 16 + 1*3 = 15+16+3=34? Wait, no: CH3O is 49? Let me calculate: O is 16, CH3 is 15, so 15+16=31. Wait, no, CH3O would be 31. But in the structure I'm considering, CH2=CHCH2COOCH3, the ester is methyl, so the fragment would be the methyl group (CH3O), which is 31. But the mass spec shows 45, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the fragment is from the acid part. For example, if the ester breaks into the acid and the alcohol. The acid part would be RCOOH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl propenoate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Formula is C5H8O2. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2. It has two oxygens, which could be from an ester group. The vinyl protons suggest a double bond, which would fit with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Wait, that's C5H8O2, but the formula is C6H10O2. Hmm, perhaps the structure is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a longer chain, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH3. That would be C7H12O2, which is more than the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is A: C6H12O2. If the structure is a diester, but that would require more oxygens, which it doesn't have.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 is from the loss of a part of the molecule. For instance, if the compound is an ester with a six-membered ring, losing a methyl group (15) from the ester's R group might leave a fragment of 45. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the result of the cleavage of the ester into a methyl group and another part. But I'm not making progress on this.

Let me think about the options again. The NMR shows vinyl protons, so the molecule has a double bond. The IR shows carbonyl and conjugated double bond. The mass spec has a fragment at 45. The options are four possible formulas.

If the correct formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has two O's and two DoU (a double bond and a carbonyl), then the structure could be an ester with a double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the ester group, perhaps losing a part of the molecule.

Alternatively, if the formula is C6H12O2 (option A), which has one DoU less, but that would imply the molecule has a ring and a carbonyl, but then how does the double bond fit in? Because each DoU accounts for a ring or a double bond.

Wait, option A: C6H12O2. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But the IR shows a carbonyl (DoU=1) and a double bond (DoU=1), which would require a total of two DoU. So option A doesn't fit because it only has one DoU. Therefore, option A is not correct.

So that leaves options B, C, and D.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be a double bond and a carbonyl. For example, an ester with a double bond. But wait, the ester has two O's, but option B only has one O. So that can't be. So option B is out.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So one DoU, either a ring or a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl and a double bond, which would require two DoU. So option D is out.

That leaves option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So that matches the IR data: a carbonyl (1 DoU) and a double bond (another DoU).

So the compound is C6H10O2. Now, the mass spec fragment at 45. If the structure is an ester with a double bond, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, if the ester is ethyl, then the ethoxy group would be 45. So the formula would have to have an ethoxy group (C2H5O) which is 45. So the formula would be C6H10O2, and the ester is ethyl.

So, for example, the structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. But option C is C6H10O2, which is two more carbons and two more hydrogens. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3 with a double bond elsewhere? Alternatively, maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, let me recount. CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3: C (2 from CH2=CH) + 3 from COOCH2CH3 (3 carbons: COO is two, CH2CH3 is two, but wait, COO is two carbons, then CH2CH3 is two more. So total is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 carbons. Wait, no: CH2=CH-COO-CH2CH3. So the carbons are: CH2=CH (2), COO (2), CH2CH3 (2) → total 2+2+2=6. Oh, so that's correct. So formula is C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 → C6H10O2.

Let me count the H: CH2=CH- has 3 H (since CH2=CH2 would have 4 H, but as CH2=CH- it's 3 H). COOCH2CH3: the ester group. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2CH3.

So each CH2 group has 2 H. Let me count all H:

CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H. So CH2=CH- → 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) = 3 H.

COOCH2CH3: the COO is O-C-O. The CH2CH3 has 2*(2 H) =4 H. So COOCH2CH3 contributes 4 H.

The COO itself has no H attached. The carbonyl is C=O. So total H from the ester part is 3 (from CH2=CH) + 4 (from CH2CH3) =7 H? Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2. So I must have made a mistake in counting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the H in the structure:

Structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

- CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So CH2=CH- → each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces the H count. Wait, CH2=CH- has 3 H (since each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond affects the count). Let me think: CH2=CH2 has 4 H, but CH2=CH- as a substituent would have 3 H (like in CH2=CHCOO-).

The COO group: no H attached.

The ester R group is CH2CH3, which has 2 CH2 groups: CH2-CH3. Each CH2 has 2 H, so 4 H.

So total H: 3 (from CH2=CH-) + 4 (from CH2CH3) =7 H. But the formula is C6H10O2, which has 10 H. So I'm missing 3 H.

Ah, I see. The COO group is in the middle, so perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2CH3. The carbonyl is in the middle, so the full structure is:

CH2=CH-C(O)-O-CH2CH3.

So each carbon in the COO is connected. Let me count all H:

- CH2=CH-: this group has 3 H (each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces one H, so it's 3 H).
- COO- has no H attached.
- O-CH2CH3: the CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So that's 5 H.

But wait, the COO group is part of the ester. So the carbonyl is O=C-O. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(O)O-CH2CH3.

So the H on the ester oxygen (O-) is part of the CH2CH3 group. So the CH2=CHCOO- group is:

CH2=CH-C(=O)-O-

Which would have the H count as:

CH2=CH-: 3 H.

C(=O): no H attached.

O-: no H attached (since it's connected to the CH2CH3).

Then the CH2CH3: 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) =5 H.

So total H: 3 +5=8. But the formula is C6H10O2. I'm still short by 2 H. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be C7H12O2, which is not among the options. So perhaps my initial assumption about the structure is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, considering the IR shows a peak at 1650 cm^-1, which could be a conjugated double bond. So the structure must have a double bond near the carbonyl group.

Perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is C5H8O2, but that doesn't fit the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure about the H count.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's count the H:

Assuming R is CH2CH3, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (C6H10O2). Wait, no: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 has 6 carbons (CH2=CH (2) + COO (2) + CH2CH3 (2) → total 6). Let's count H:

CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, but since it's CH2=CH-, the H count is 3.

COO: no H.

CH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 → total 5.

So total H: 3 +5 =8. But the formula is C6H10O2, which has 10 H. So I'm missing 2 H. Where could they be?

Ah, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a longer chain. For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. Let's see:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH3 → C6H10O2.

Counting H:

CH2=CHCH2-: each CH2 has 2 H. CH2=CH has 3 H (as before). CH2 after that has 2 H. So 3 +2 =5 H from this part.

COOCH3: the OCH3 has 3 H.

Total H: 5 +3 =8. Still short by 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some H. Let me count again:

Structure: CH2=CHCH2COOCH3.

Carbon chain: 6 carbons.

Hydrogen count:

- CH2=CH: each CH2 in CH2= has 2 H, CH has 1 H. So 2 +1 =3 H.

- CH2: next CH2 has 2 H.

- COOCH3: OCH3 has 3 H.

So 3 (from CH2=CH) +2 (from CH2) +3 (from OCH3) =8 H. The formula requires 10 H. So where are the other 2 H? They must be on the carbons.

Wait, the carbons in the chain:

CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

So:

CH2=CH-CH2-: each CH2 has 2 H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3. Let's count each:

CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces it to 3 H.

CH2: next CH2 has 2 H.

COOCH3: the OCH3 has 3 H.

But wait, each CH2 in the chain has 2 H. So:

- CH2=CH: 3 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- COOCH3: OCH3 has 3 H.

But that's 3+2+3=8 H. So the formula should be C6H8O2, but the option is C6H10O2. So I'm still missing 2 H.

Ah, perhaps the structure isn't as I thought. Maybe the double bond is in a different position, allowing more H. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a branching that allows more H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. No, that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2. The NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. The IR shows a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, which is likely the ethoxy group. So the ester is ethyl, which gives the 45 fragment.

So the structure would be something like RCOOCH2CH3, where RCOOCH2CH3 is part of a molecule with a double bond. For example, if R is CH2=CHCH2-, then the structure would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's check the formula:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3: 2 (from CH2=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 2 (COO) +2 (CH2CH3) =7 carbons. No, that's 7, but option C is 6. So perhaps R is CH2=CH-.

So RCOOCH2CH3 would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's 5 carbons, but option C is 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, which is C7H12O2. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's C7H10O2. Not matching.

I'm starting to think that option C is the correct formula, despite the confusion with the H count. The IR and NMR data fit, and the mass spec fragment at 45 suggests an ethoxy group, which would be present in an ethyl ester. Since option C is C6H10O2, and the structure must have a double bond and an ester group, I think the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the provided spectral data:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** suggests an sp² C-H stretch, likely from a vinyl group (alkene).
- A **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester.
- A **strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹** suggests a conjugated system, likely from a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** confirm the presence of a double bond in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is consistent with the ethoxy group (C₂H₅O), which has a molecular weight of 45. This suggests the compound contains an ethyl ester group.

### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]
- For **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]
  This does not account for the double bond and carbonyl group observed in the IR spectrum.

- For **C₆H₁₀O (Option B)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]
  However, this formula has only one oxygen, which cannot account for the ester group (two oxygen atoms).

- For **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]
  This matches the IR data, as the two degrees of unsaturation correspond to the double bond and the carbonyl group.

- For **C₆H₁₂O (Option D)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]
  This does not account for the double bond and carbonyl group observed in the IR spectrum.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two degrees of unsaturation to match the IR data (a double bond and a carbonyl group). Additionally, the mass spectrometry data suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (C₂H₅O), which is consistent with an ethyl ester. Among the options, **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all the spectral data and has the correct functional groups (ester and conjugated double bond).
