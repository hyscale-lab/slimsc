Okay, so I have this problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but let's try to work through this.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should probably write that down.

So, S looks like:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay is c multiplied by S. So Ay would be (h/(4π)) times this matrix. Let me compute the matrix of Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S → each element is multiplied by that constant.

Wait, but when finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the eigenvalues depend on the operator's matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. Alternatively, (Ay - a I) φ = 0. The determinant of (Ay - a I) should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So let me construct the matrix Ay - a I. Let's compute each element.

The diagonal elements of Ay are zero because S has zeros on the diagonal. So Ay's diagonal elements are zero times (h/(4π)), so still zero. So Ay - a I would have -a on the diagonal.

So the matrix is:
[ -a       (h/(4π))(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))i       -a ]

The determinant is [(-a)(-a) - ( (h/(4π))(-i) ) ( (h/(4π)) i ) ] = a² - [ (h/(4π))² (i)(-i) ]

Wait, because (h/(4π))² times (-i)(i) is (h/(4π))² * (-i²) → since i² is -1, that's (h/(4π))² * (1) → (h^2)/(16 π²).

So determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Set this equal to zero: a² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

But wait, wait. The eigenvalues are the solutions for a. So a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait the determinant is [ (-a)(-a) ) - ( (h/(4π))(-i) ) * ( (h/(4π)) i ) ]

Which is a² - [ (h/(4π))^2 * (-i * i) ]

Since (-i) * i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's (h^2)/(16 π²) * 1.

So determinant is a² - (h^2)/(16 π²) =0 → a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). These are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, in our case, the eigenvalues are real. So their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it mentions non-zero imaginary parts.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Options C and D are about eigenfunctions.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Well, A is the angular momentum operator. The square of the angular momentum (A²) is diagonal in the same basis as the eigenfunctions of the angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the eigenfunctions of A_y should also be eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with all components (since angular momentum components commute with each other only when considering different axes, but wait no, actually, angular momentum components don't commute with each other. Wait, actually, [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z. So they don't commute. So A² commutes with each component, so the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A².

Hmm, but what about Az? The eigenfunctions of Ay aren't the same as those of Az, since they don't commute. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, would it also be an eigenfunction of Az? I don't think so, because they don't share eigenfunctions unless they commute. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That sounds correct.

Wait, but wait. The operator A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-½ particles, A² has eigenvalue ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So any spin state would have A² as 3ħ²/4. So any eigenstate of Ay would automatically be an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part says they can't be eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So yes, C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions of Ay would be the eigenvectors. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis. But the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Wait, I'm not too sure. The operator is represented in the basis of its eigenvectors. So if the eigenvectors form a basis, then any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So φ are the basis functions. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Hmm, this might be correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct way to phrase it.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As discussed, this seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the operator's matrix is expressed in the standard basis (probably the z-basis, since S is given in the question), but the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthonormal basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions can serve as a basis. So D is also a correct statement?

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. Let's read the options again.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the matrix operator Ay is expressed in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form another basis. So the φ's are not the basis in which the operator is represented, but they form a different basis. So the statement might not be correct.

So, if the operator is given in a particular basis, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a new basis. So D says that the eigenvectors are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not sure if that's the correct way to phrase it. Alternatively, if the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then yes, those are the basis functions in which the operator is diagonal. So D's statement would be correct.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The matrix operator Ay is given in some basis (probably the computational basis, like |+z> and |-z>). The eigenvectors of Ay would form another basis (the |+y> and |-y> states if we're talking about spin). So the eigenvectors φ are the basis functions for the operator in that diagonal representation. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, they form a basis, so D's statement would be correct.

So now I'm confused between options C and D.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the options again.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts. So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, looking at the possible options, only C and D are possible.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes, because A² is a scalar operator (same for any direction), any eigenstate of any component would be an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are two orthogonal vectors. They form a basis for the space (which is 2D, so any two orthogonal vectors can form a basis). So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis for Ay.

But another point: the matrix S given is the spin component matrix. Wait, S is actually (1/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and for spin-½ systems, S = ħ/2 σ. Wait, but in the question, S is given as a 2x2 matrix with 0 and i, so S is like the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by 1/2? Or wait, let me think.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S in the question is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is exactly σ_y. So S is σ_y.

But in the spin matrices, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ. So the standard spin operator Sz is (ħ/2) σ_z, and so on.

But in this problem, Ay is given as c * S, where c = h/(4π).

Wait, if S is σ_y, which is the Pauli matrix, then Ay = (h/(4π)) σ_y.

Wait, but usually, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) σ, so perhaps this c is different.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of σ_y, which are ±1.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are (ħ/2)(±1) → ± ħ/2.

So a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated, I thought a was ± h/(4π) which is ħ/2 because h=2πħ. So yeah, they are the same.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So they are real numbers. So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts.

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are both incorrect.

So the possible options are C and D.

Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is ( (ħ/2)( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) )) ) → but wait, wait. Wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. Its square, A², is (s(s+1)) ħ², where s is the spin quantum number. For a muon, which is a spin-½ particle, s=½. So A² has eigenvalue (3/4) ħ².

Since any eigenstate of Ay must also be an eigenstate of A², because A² commutes with all components. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct.

As for Az, since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthonormal basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these basis functions. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The basis functions of the operator would be the basis in which the operator is represented. But if Ay is given in the standard basis (say, the z-basis), then the eigenvectors form a different basis. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay as given. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct because Ay is represented in a different basis (the standard one), not in the eigenbasis. So the statement might not be correct.

Wait, the question says, "the matrix operator has the form Ay = c·S", which is given in a certain basis. The eigenvectors of Ay form another basis. So the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the operator's matrix is expressed in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So the statement in D might be incorrect.

Alternatively, any set of eigenvectors can form a basis. So the operator can be represented in the eigenbasis, so the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for that representation. So D's statement could be correct.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is whether the statements are correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. So correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form a basis. So in that diagonal basis, the operator's matrix is diagonal. So the statement in D is correct.

But wait, the question says, the matrix operator is given as Ay = c·S. So the matrix is in the standard basis, I assume. The eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So the statement in D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis in which Ay is given. So D's statement is incorrect.

So now, the correct options seem to be C and D.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is option C.

Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So option C is correct.

So the options:

A) No, eigenvalues are real.

B) No, same reason.

C) Correct.

D) Not sure, but perhaps incorrect because the eigenvectors form a new basis, not the one in which Ay is originally written.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct option.

So the correct statements are C and D? Or only C.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

In this problem, the matrix operator is given as Ay = c·S, a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix operator. Because when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors are the basis. So yes, the statement in D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck between C and D.

Hmm, let me think again about the possible options. The only correct statement about the eigenvalues is that they are ± h/(4π) (which is ± ħ/2), so options A and B are wrong.

So between C and D.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So correct because eigenfunctions of any component are eigenfunctions of A², but not of the other components.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions form a basis of the space, so yes, D is correct.

But wait, the matrix is given in a particular basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So D's statement is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, regardless of the original basis used to represent the operator.

So perhaps both statements C and D are correct. But the options don't include that.

Wait, in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) Incorrect.

B) Incorrect.

C) Correct.

D) Also correct.

Hmm, but the options are designed so that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine option D.

The statement says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the matrix's basis is given, so the eigenvectors form a new basis. So the operator's matrix in that new basis is diagonal. So the statement in D is correct.

But I'm not sure whether the matrix is represented in the eigenbasis or not. The problem states that the matrix Ay is given, so it's in some basis. The eigenvectors form a different basis. So the statement in D would be incorrect, because the eigenfunctions are not the basis in which the operator is given.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

But I think the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct eigenvalues and eigenvectors again.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So real numbers.

So the only correct statements are C and D.

But looking back, the question gives four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Because during the calculation, you can note that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So the correct answer is C.

The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalue equation is \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue.
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is given by:
     \[
     A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
     0 & -i \\ 
     i & 0 
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - Solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), the eigenvalues are found to be:
     \[
     a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - These eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts are zero.

2. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, not complex.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of angular momentum, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous. While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, the operator \( A_y \) is given in a specific basis (likely the standard basis), and the eigenfunctions form a different basis. Thus, this statement is not strictly correct.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Options A and B are incorrect due to incorrect eigenvalue statements.
   - Option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions form a different basis from the one in which \( A_y \) is given.
   - Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
