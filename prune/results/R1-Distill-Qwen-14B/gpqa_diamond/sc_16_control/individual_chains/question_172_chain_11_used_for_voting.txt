Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's try to think through this.

So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution, right?

I remember the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait, E is the energy difference. So since E2 is higher than E1 (since excitation is higher), the exponent is negative.

In this problem, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let's clarify: I think the ratio of the excited states to the ground state is what's being compared. So for star 1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star 2 in the same energy level. Wait no, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Maybe it's the ratio of populations in the excited state compared to the ground state.

Wait, no, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe it's that the population in the specific energy level (let's say level 2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, no, actually, maybe it's the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms. Because if something is more excited, it has more atoms in higher energy states. So for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state (n2) is twice that of star_2's n2. Or wait, maybe the ratio n2/n1 is higher. Let me get this straight.

Wait, wait. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n2) to the ground state (n1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, n2_2 / n1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But the question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, what's the exact wording? "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited..." Maybe it's talking about the ratio of n2 to n1. So for star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or maybe it's that n2_1 = 2 * n2_2, but that depends on the total number of atoms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the total number is higher. Alternatively, maybe the excitation refers to the ionization or some other state, but I think the problem is about the relative populations in two energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the excitation via the ratio of the same energy level in each star. So for star_1, the population in a certain energy level is twice that of star_2. Let me think: Let's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in the lower state as R1 and R2 for stars 1 and 2, respectively. So R1 = n2_1 / n1_1, R2 = n2_2 / n1_2.

The problem says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the excitation energy per atom is twice as much. But that doesn't quite make sense. Probably, it's about the population ratio.

So, let's proceed. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 R2.

So, 2 R2 = R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

But R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So substituting R2:

2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Take natural logs on both sides to simplify.

ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) - (ΔE)/(k T2) ) = - (ΔE)/(k T1 )

Bring the terms with T to one side.

ln(2) = (ΔE)/(k T2) - (ΔE)/(k T1 )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ln(2) = (ΔE)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Hmm, so that's the equation we get.

But looking at the options, which of them matches this structure.

Our equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

But the ΔE and k are given or are constants. Wait, but in the options, I don't see any terms involving ΔE, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, perhaps ΔE/(k) is a term that can be expressed in terms of temperatures somehow, but probably not necessary for the equation structure.

Wait, looking at the answer choices, they're all equations with ln(2) equal to something involving T1 and T2. So our equation is ln(2) equals (ΔE)/(k) multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1). But none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ratio R1/R2 = 2. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The excitation is a measure of the relative populations. So for star 1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star 2. But wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Let me think of it as the number of atoms in the excited state per atom in the ground state is twice as much.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Which would lead to:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

(1/T2 - 1/T1) * (ΔE/k) = ln(2)

Hmm, so this is the same as before. Now, the options don't have ΔE/k, but they are about T1 and T2. So perhaps the options are written in terms that eliminate ΔE and k?

Wait, perhaps we can write the equation as:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

But without knowing ΔE or k, perhaps we can express this as a ratio.

Wait, the equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, that's because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

But the question is about the equation for the temperatures. So the options are the right-hand sides.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( (T1 T2)^2 )

Others don't have this form.

Wait, so in our equation, the right-hand side is [ (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't include ΔE and k. So perhaps the provided options assume that (ΔE/k) is 1, which seems unlikely. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about what the problem is giving. The energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute (ΔE)/(k). The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, so (ΔE)/(k) = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) = 1 K.

Wait, that's interesting! So ΔE/k = 1 K. So substituting back into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which matches option D's equation.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but in our equation from earlier, the numerator was (T1 - T2) and the denominator (T1 T2).

So yes, option D is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the relative populations of atoms in two energy states. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of the populations in the excited state to the ground state are given by:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting \( R_2 \) into the equation for \( R_1 \), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation.
