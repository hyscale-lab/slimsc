Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through this.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex—so that's probably the Co(SCN)2 complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it the tetra? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The complexes are CoSCN, Co(SCN)2, etc., up to Co(SCN)4. Each has its own stability constant.

Stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

The question is about the percentage of a specific complex. The options are percentages, so we're looking for the fraction of Co in a particular form.

I think the approach here is to calculate the concentrations of each possible Co complex and then find the fraction of the desired one. But given that there are four complexes, that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify by considering that the highest β is for the third complex (β3=63), so that would be the most stable. But wait, β4 is 16, which is lower, so perhaps the complexes with higher β are more populated.

Wait, wait. The stability constant β for each complex is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more the complex forms.

But to find the distribution, I remember that we can use the formation of complexes step-wise or overall. Wait, I think each β is for the step-wise addition. So β1 is the constant for Co(SCN) → CoSCN^2+, β2 is for adding another SCN to make Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on.

Alternatively, the overall formation constants for each complex would be the product of the βs up to that point. For example, the overall β for Co(SCN)_n would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, wait. Stability constants can be cumulative. That is, for each successive addition of a ligand. So for the first complex, CoSCN^2+ has β1=9. The second complex, Co(SCN)2^2+, has β2=40, so its overall β is β1 * β2=9*40=360. Similarly, Co(SCN)3^2+ would have β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680. And the fourth complex would have β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but wait. Or are the β's given as the overall stability constants for each complex? Because sometimes, the stability constant for the n-th complex is the product of the step-wise β's up to that point. Hmm. So perhaps the overall β for each complex is:

β1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)2^2+]/([CoSCN^2+][SCN^-])

β3 = [Co(SCN)3^2+]/([Co(SCN)2^2+][SCN^-])

β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2+]/([Co(SCN)3^2+][SCN^-])

Wait, that's the step-wise approach. So the overall β for each complex (the nth) is the product of the first n βs.

So the overall β for Co(SCN)_n^2+ is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the first complex (n=1) has β = 9.

n=2: 9 *40=360.

n=3: 9*40*63=22680.

n=4: 22680 *16=362880.

But wait, that's a big jump. So the fourth complex is way more stable than the third? But β4 is 16, which is less than β3=63. So each step's β is the additional factor for adding another ligand.

But wait, this might not be correct. I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each β is the overall constant for that complex. But that can't be, because β1 is 9, β2 is 40, which is higher than β1, which would imply that the second complex is more stable than the first. Hmm. But that can't be the case because each step adds a ligand, which may be easier or harder.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formation of each complex from the previous one. So the total concentration of all complexes and the free Co^2+ would be equal to the total Co concentration.

So the total Co concentration is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^2+] + [Co(SCN)2^2+] + [Co(SCN)3^2+] + [Co(SCN)4^2+].

We know c_total is 1e-2 M. And the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

We need to find the fraction of the cobalt in the dithiocyanato form, which is Co(SCN)2^2+. So I need to calculate [Co(SCN)2^2+] divided by the total Co concentration (times 100% for percentage).

But how do I find each concentration?

I think the approach is to set up the expressions for each complex in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-], then find the ratios and find the fraction.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then, for each complex:

[CoSCN^2+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = β2 * [CoSCN^2+] * [SCN^-] = 40 * (0.9 x) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x.

Wait, no. Wait, the step-wise β2 is the formation constant for adding the second SCN^- to form the second complex from the first. So [Co(SCN)2^2+] = β2 * [CoSCN^2+] * [SCN^-] = 40 * (0.9 x) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3^2+] = β3 * [Co(SCN)2^2+] * [SCN^-] =63 * (3.6 x) *0.1=63 * 0.36 x=22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)4^2+] = β4 * [Co(SCN)3^2+] * [SCN^-] =16 * (22.68 x) * 0.1 =16 *2.268 x=36.288 x.

So now, the concentrations are:

Co^2+ : x

CoSCN^2+ : 0.9 x

Co(SCN)2^2+ :3.6 x

Co(SCN)3^2+ :22.68 x

Co(SCN)4^2+ :36.288 x.

And the total Co concentration is:

x + 0.9 x + 3.6 x +22.68 x +36.288 x = (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) x.

Adding them up:

1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So total Co =64.468 x =1e-2 M.

So x= (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, x is [Co^2+]. Then, the concentration of each complex is:

CoSCN^2+ =0.9 x≈0.9 * 0.0001551=0.0001396 M.

Co(SCN)2^2+ =3.6 x ≈3.6 * 0.0001551≈0.0005584 M.

Co(SCN)3^2+ =22.68 x≈22.68 *0.0001551≈0.003515 M.

Co(SCN)4^2+ =36.288 x≈36.288 *0.0001551≈0.00563 M.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01 M. So 0.01 divided by 64.468 is approximately 0.0001551 M.

Wait, but let me calculate 0.01 /64.468: 64.468 is about 64.468. So 0.01/64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

So [Co^2+] =1.551e-4 M.

Then, [CoSCN^2+] =0.9 *1.551e-4=1.3959e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3^2+] =22.68 *1.551e-4=22.68 * 0.0001551 =approx 0.003515 M.

Wait, 22.68 * 1.551e-4: 22.68 * 0.0001551.

22.68 * 0.0001 =0.002268, 22.68 *0.0000551= approx 22.68 *5.51e-5= approx 0.001248.

So total is ~0.003516 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)4^2+] =36.288 *1.551e-4.

36.288 *0.0001=0.0036288, 36.288 *0.0000551= approx 36.288 *5.51e-5=approx 0.00200.

So total is about 0.0056288 M.

Wait, but let me compute each exactly.

Wait, x=0.01 /64.468 = 0.0001551 (approximately).

So,

[Co^2+] = x =0.0001551 M.

[CoSCN^2+] =0.9 x=0.00013959 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =3.6 x=0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)3^2+] =22.68 x= 22.68 * 0.0001551= 0.003515 M.

[Co(SCN)4^2+] =36.288 x= 36.288 *0.0001551 ≈ 0.00563 M.

Now, to compute the total: 0.0001551 + 0.00013959 +0.00055836 +0.003515 +0.00563.

Adding sequentially:

0.0001551 +0.00013959=0.00029469

+0.00055836=0.00085305

+0.003515=0.00436805

+0.00563=0.00999805.

Wait, but the initial total was 0.01 M. So this adds up to ~0.009998 M, which is about 0.01 M, so that's correct.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that refers to the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, which is the second complex.

So [Co(SCN)2^2+] is 0.00055836 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is 0.00055836 / 0.01 =0.055836, which is 5.5836%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I'm using the step-wise βs incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I should be considering the overall β for each complex and then calculate their concentrations using those.

Wait, another approach: Each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the overall β and [SCN^-]^n.

So for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n^2+] = (βn * [Co^2+]) * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The overall β for the n-th complex is the product of the step-wise βs, β1*β2*...*βn.

So for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n^2+] = (β_total_n) * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Where β_total_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, for the first complex:

β_total_1=9.

[CoSCN^2+] =9 *x * (0.1)^1 =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)2^2+]= β_total_2 *x*(0.1)^2. β_total_2=9*40=360.

So [Co(SCN)2^2+]=360 x (0.1)^2=360 x *0.01=3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)3^2+]= β_total_3 *x*(0.1)^3. β_total_3=9*40*63=22680.

So 22680 * x *0.001=22.68 x.

And [Co(SCN)4^2+]= β_total_4 *x*(0.1)^4. β_total_4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So 362880 * x *0.0001=36.288 x.

Wait, that's the same as what I did before. So the same results, so same fractions.

Wait, but then why is the result not matching the options? Maybe I misunderstood which complex is the blue one.

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Dithiocyanato would have two SCN ligands, so Co(SCN)2^2+ is the dithiocyanato complex.

But according to my calculation, this is 5.58% of the total, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility—maybe the stability constants are given as logβ, but the problem states β1=9, etc. So they are not logs, so we don't need to adjust for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the complexes in a different way.

Wait, maybe the formation constants are given for each additional ligand, but I've used them as step-wise, which is correct. So perhaps the percentages are not based on just the Co(SCN)2^2+ but perhaps another isomer or maybe considering another factor.

Wait, the problem statement says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species". So perhaps I have made a calculation error.

Wait, let me re-calculate the concentrations.

Wait, x is [Co^2+] = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

So, [CoSCN^2+] =0.9 x = 1.396e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =3.6 x=5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3^2+] =22.68 x=3.515e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4^2+] =36.288 x=5.628e-3 M.

Wait, wait. 36.288 * 1.551e-4 (x) is 36.288 *0.0001551= approximately 0.00563 M.

But let me compute each:

[Co^2+] =1.551e-4 → 0.0001551 M.

[CoSCN^2+] =0.9 * 0.0001551 =0.00013959 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =3.6 *0.0001551=0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)3^2+] =22.68 *0.0001551 =0.003515 M.

[Co(SCN)4^2+] =36.288 *0.0001551=0.00563 M.

So, the total is 0.0001551 +0.00013959 +0.00055836 +0.003515 +0.00563 ≈ 0.01 M, which checks out.

So [Co(SCN)2^2+] is 0.00055836 M.

So the percentage is (0.00055836 /0.01) *100 =5.5836%. But this isn't any of the given options.

Hmm. So maybe I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue one. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, which is not dithiocyanato. So the dithiocyanato is the second complex.

Wait, but maybe the "blue" refers to a different complex. I'm a bit unsure about the chemistry here. Wait, I think that [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is blue, but sometimes higher complexes can also be blue. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to another complex.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all complexes with two SCN ligands, but that doesn't make sense because each complex is a different number of ligands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the concentrations. Let me think again.

Another thought: Maybe the β values are given as the overall stability constants, not step-wise. So, for the first complex, β1=9 is the overall constant. For the second, β2=40 is the overall for the second, but that would be impossible because β2 would be much larger than β1.

Wait, no, that's not possible because the overall β for the second complex would be β1 * β2=9*40=360. So, the second complex has a higher β than the first.

But if the given βs are the overall constants for each complex, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, maybe the question provides the overall β for each complex, not the step-wise. Let me think.

If the βs are the overall constants for each complex, then:

β1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])=9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)=40.

β3 = [Co(SCN)3^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)=63.

β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)=16.

Wait, but that can't be right because β3 would then be lower than β2, which wouldn't make sense for stability. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each β is the cumulative constant.

Wait, but in any case, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe another way to model this is to set up the fractions based on the ratios of the concentrations.

Wait, considering that [Co(SCN)_n^2+] = (β_total_n) [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So, the ratio of [Co(SCN)_n^2+] to [Co^2+] is β_total_n [SCN^-]^n.

So, the ratio for each n is:

n=1: 9 * (0.1) =0.9 → [CoSCN^2+] =0.9 [Co^2+].

n=2: 360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6 → [Co(SCN)2^2+] =3.6 [Co^2+].

n=3: 22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68 → [Co(SCN)3^2+]=22.68 [Co^2+].

n=4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → [Co(SCN)4^2+]=36.288 [Co^2+].

So, the concentrations are in the ratios:

n=0: [Co^2+] =x.

n=1: 0.9 x.

n=2:3.6 x.

n=3:22.68 x.

n=4:36.288 x.

So the total parts are x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x =64.468 x, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the fraction for each complex is their ratio divided by 64.468.

So, for n=2, it's 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557, which is 5.57%, as before.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the problem is in the assumption that the βs are step-wise, but perhaps I'm supposed to consider a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex refers to Co(SCN)2^2+ and Co(SCN)3^2+. Wait, no, the dithiocyanato would have two SCN ligands. So it's only the second complex.

Another thought: Maybe I should compute the fraction of Co(SCN)2^2+ plus any other forms. But in the given problem statement, it's clear that the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in adding the concentrations.

Wait, let me recompute the fractions.

Total Co is 64.468 x, where x is [Co^2+].

So, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 x / (64.468 x) ) =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557, 5.57%.

But again, the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. But [SCN^-] might not be 0.1 M because some of it is tied up in the complexes. Wait, that's a crucial point! Because when the SCN- ions form complexes with Co, the free [SCN^-] decreases. So my initial assumption that [SCN^-] remains 0.1 M is incorrect. Oh no, that's a big mistake. So this complicates things because now [SCN^-] is dependent on how much is used in the complexes.

Ah! This changes everything. I didn't consider that the formation of complexes will consume SCN^-.

So, the initial approach is wrong because I assumed [SCN^-] remains 0.1 M, but in reality, some of it is tied up in the complexes. So I need to account for the change in [SCN^-].

This makes the problem more complicated because now the concentration of [SCN^-] is a variable that depends on the extent of complex formation.

So, how to approach this?

Let me think. Let me denote the total concentration of SCN- as c_scn =0.1 M. The total SCN- is the sum of the free SCN- plus the SCN- bound in each complex.

Each complex has n SCN- ions, so:

Total SCN- = [SCN^-] + n1[CoSCN^2+] + n2[Co(SCN)2^2+] +n3[Co(SCN)3^2+] +n4[Co(SCN)4^2+}.

Where n1=1, n2=2, n3=3, n4=4. So:

[SCN^-] + [CoSCN^2+] + 2[Co(SCN)2^2+] +3[Co(SCN)3^2+] +4[Co(SCN)4^2+] =0.1.

But [CoSCN^2+] =β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

Similarly, [Co(SCN)2^2+]=β2 [CoSCN^2+][SCN^-}=β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Wait, but this is getting really complicated. Let's think in terms of variables.

Let me denote x = [Co^2+], and s = [SCN^-}.

We have two equations:

1) x + [CoSCN^2+] + [Co(SCN)2^2+] + [Co(SCN)3^2+] + [Co(SCN)4^2+] = 0.01.

2) s + [CoSCN^2+] + 2[Co(SCN)2^2+] +3[Co(SCN)3^2+] +4[Co(SCN)4^2+] =0.1.

But each [Co(SCN)_n^2+] can be written in terms of x and s.

[CoSCN^2+] = β1 x s =9 x s.

[Co(SCN)2^2+]= β2 [CoSCN^2+] s = β2 (9 x s) s =9 β2 x s^2. But β2 is 40, so 9 *40=360. So [Co(SCN)2^2+] =360 x s^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3^2+] = β3 [Co(SCN)2^2+] s =63 *360 x s^2 *s=63*360 x s^3=22680 x s^3.

And [Co(SCN)4^2+] =β4 [Co(SCN)3^2+] s=16 *22680 x s^3 *s=362880 x s^4.

So substituting these into equation 1:

x +9 x s +360 x s^2 +22680 x s^3 +362880 x s^4 =0.01 M.

Factor x:

x [1 +9 s +360 s^2 +22680 s^3 +362880 s^4 ] =0.01.

And equation 2:

s +9 x s + 2*(360 x s^2) +3*(22680 x s^3) +4*(362880 x s^4) =0.1.

Which simplifies to:

s +9 x s +720 x s^2 +68040 x s^3 +1451520 x s^4 =0.1.

This is a system of two equations with two variables x and s.

This looks extremely complicated. I'm not sure how to solve this analytically. Maybe we can make some approximations.

But perhaps the concentration of Co is much lower than the SCN- concentration, so s ≈0.1 M. That's an assumption, but let's see.

If s≈0.1, then in equation 1:

x [1 +9*(0.1) +360*(0.1)^2 +22680*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4 ] ≈0.01.

Compute the terms inside the brackets:

1 +0.9 +360*(0.01) +22680*(0.001) +362880*(0.0001).

Compute each term:

1 →1.

0.9 →0.9.

360 *0.01=3.6.

22680 *0.001=22.68.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So equation 1 becomes x * 64.468≈0.01 → x≈0.0001551, as before.

Then, using this x, compute equation 2:

s +9 x s +720 x s^2 +68040 x s^3 +1451520 x s^4 ≈0.1.

Substituting x=1.551e-4 and s=0.1:

s =0.1.

9 x s =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1=1.3959e-5.

720 x s^2=720 *1.551e-4 *0.01=720 *1.551e-6= approx 1.1167e-3.

68040 x s^3 =68040 *1.551e-4 *0.001=68040 *1.551e-7= approx 1.053e-2.

1451520 x s^4=1451520 *1.551e-4 *0.0001=1451520 *1.551e-8≈2.248e-3.

Adding all terms:

s=0.1 →0.1

plus 1.3959e-5 ≈0.00001396.

plus 1.1167e-3≈0.0011167.

plus 1.053e-2≈0.01053.

plus 2.248e-3≈0.002248.

Total: 0.1 + 0.00001396 +0.0011167 +0.01053 +0.002248 = 0.11390866.

But this is way more than 0.1, which is the total SCN- concentration. So our initial assumption that s=0.1 is incorrect because the complexes consume some SCN-.

So this suggests that [SCN^-] is less than 0.1 M, which complicates things.

Hmm. Perhaps we can make an initial approximation and then iterate.

Let me make an initial guess: Let's say s is approximately 0.1, but from the above calculation, the sum exceeds 0.1. So perhaps s is less than 0.1.

Let me try to set s to a lower value.

Let me denote equation 2 as:

s +9 x s +720 x s^2 +68040 x s^3 +1451520 x s^4 =0.1.

But we have x from equation 1, which depends on s. So it's a system of equations that's hard to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express x from equation 1 in terms of s.

From equation 1:

x = 0.01 / [1 +9 s +360 s^2 +22680 s^3 +362880 s^4 ].

Substitute x into equation 2:

s +9 * (0.01 / D) * s +720 * (0.01 / D) * s^2 +68040 * (0.01 / D) * s^3 +1451520 * (0.01 / D) * s^4 =0.1,

where D=1 +9 s +360 s^2 +22680 s^3 +362880 s^4.

This seems quite complex, but perhaps I can approximate by assuming that D is large, so x is small, and the higher terms may not contribute significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for s.

But this is getting extremely involved, and I'm not sure how to proceed without more advanced methods or computational tools.

An alternative approach, perhaps, is to assume that [SCN^-] ≈0.1 M, despite the consumption in complexes, but this leads to the earlier result, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps that approach is incorrect, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely, as the options are given.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that [SCN^-] remains 0.1 M, which is a common approximation when the concentration of the metal is much lower than that of the ligand. But in this problem, [Co]=0.01 M and [SCN]=0.1 M. So [Co]=0.01 M, [SCN]=0.1 M → [Co] is 10% of [SCN]. So maybe the approximation holds, but our earlier calculation gave 5.58%, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reverse formation, such as the formation of the complexes as adding SCN in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fraction based on the ratio of the formation constants, assuming that the higher β complexes dominate.

The β values for the complexes are:

n=1:9,

n=2:360,

n=3:22680,

n=4:362880.

So the highest β is for n=4, then n=3, then n=2, then n=1.

So the dominant species would be Co(SCN)4^2+.

But the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

Wait, but according to the βs, n=2 has a β of 360, which is less than n=3 and n=4.

So the dominant species are higher n complexes.

In that case, perhaps the percentage for n=2 is not high, which would align with our earlier calculation of around 5.5%, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option D)16.9%, but that's more than double of what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the fractions. Let me re-express the ratios.

Wait, considering that the concentrations are in the ratios:

n=0: 1 part,

n=1:0.9 parts,

n=2:3.6 parts,

n=3:22.68 parts,

n=4:36.288 parts.

So, the total is 64.468 parts.

The percentage for n=2 is (3.6 /64.468)*100 ≈5.58%.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of all possible dithiocyanato complexes, which might include Co(SCN)2^2+ and maybe others. But no, dithiocyanato is two SCN ligands, so only n=2.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is using a different definition for the stability constants. Maybe the βs are for the overall complex, not step-wise.

Wait, if βn is the overall constant for the n-th complex, then:

[Co(SCN)_n^2+] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So for n=2, [Co(SCN)2^2+]=β2 [Co][SCN]^2.

If β2 is 40, then [Co(SCN)2^2+] would be 40 x (0.1)^2 =4 x.

But wait, that would suggest that [Co(SCN)2^2+] is 4x.

Similarly, [CoSCN^2+] =β1 x (0.1) =9 x *0.1=0.9x.

[Co(SCN)3^2+] =β3 x (0.1)^3=63 x *0.001=0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)4^2+] =β4 x (0.1)^4=16 x *0.0001=0.0016 x.

So the total Co is:

x +0.9x +4x +0.063x +0.0016x= (1+0.9+4+0.063+0.0016)x=6.0646 x.

Set equal to 0.01 M: 6.0646 x=0.01 →x=0.01/6.0646≈0.00165 M.

Wait, that's [Co^2+]=0.00165 M.

Then, [CoSCN^2+]=0.9 x=0.9 *0.00165=0.001485 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+]=4x=0.0066 M.

[Co(SCN)3^2+]=0.063 x=0.0001035 M.

[Co(SCN)4^2+]=0.0016 x=0.0000264 M.

So the total is 0.00165 +0.001485 +0.0066 +0.0001035 +0.0000264 ≈0.01 M.

Now, the percentage for [Co(SCN)2^2+] is (0.0066 /0.01) *100=66%. Which is not an option either.

But the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, etc., so this approach also doesn't help.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem is using the stability constants as the step-wise ones and that the [SCN^-] is not 0.1 M because it's consumed.

But with the time I have, perhaps I should consider that the correct approach is the initial one, but I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the sum of all complexes except the free Co^2+ as the denominator. But in that case, the denominator would be (64.468 x -x) =63.468 x.

So the fraction for n=2 would be (3.6 x)/(63.468 x) )=3.6/63.468 ≈5.67%.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the complexes as different isomers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the initial approach and the correct answer is option C) 38.1%.

Wait, 38.1% would correspond to 0.381 *64.468 ≈24.5. So, if n=2 is 3.6, that would be way below 38%.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fraction as [Co(SCN)2^2+] / (all complexes plus free Co^2+), which is the same as before.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would include all complexes with two SCN ligands, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the percentage of all the complexes except the free ion, but that's not clear.

I'm stuck. I think I'll go back to the initial approach and see if any of the given options could come from a different calculation.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the βs are given as the log of the stability constants. But the problem states β1=9, β2=40, etc. If they were logs, that would be a different approach. But the problem didn't mention log, so I think they are not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the third complex, which has β=63, but that would give a higher percentage.

Wait, looking at the options, the highest is 42.3%, which is about 0.423.

If the fraction is 3.6/8.5, that would be about 42%, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions correctly.

As per the initial approach (ignoring the change in [SCN^-]), the fractions are:

n=0:1.55e-4 → 0.1551%,

n=1:1.396e-4 → 0.1396%,

n=2:5.5836e-4 →0.55836%,

n=3:3.515e-3 →0.3515%,

n=4:5.63e-3 →0.563%.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.0001551 M is 1.551e-4 M, which is 0.01551 mM, so 0.01551% of 1 M.

But the percentages would be calculated as:

n=2:5.5836e-4 /0.01 =5.5836% → 5.58%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the percentage of all possible dithiocyanato species, but I don't think that makes sense.

Another idea: Maybe the βs are given for the reverse reaction. But that would lower the β, making the complexes less stable, which doesn't align with the given βs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the complexes can dissociate, and we're to calculate the fraction based on the ionization states. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct approach is to go with the initial calculation, but perhaps the correct answer is option C)38.1%, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the total number of moles. Let me recheck:

Each Co in a complex contributes as follows:

n=0: Co^2+ → 1 Co.

n=1: CoSCN^2+ →1 Co.

n=2: Co(SCN)2^2+ →1 Co.

n=3: Co(SCN)3^2+ →1 Co.

n=4: Co(SCN)4^2+ →1 Co.

So each complex has one Co, so the total Co is the sum of the concentrations of all complexes and free Co^2+.

So, in the initial approach, the fractions are correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the complexes beyond two ligands as not blue, but that's not a factor in the calculation.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes among all possible complexes, excluding the free Co^2+.

In that case, the denominator would be 0.01 - x.

So x=1.551e-4 M.

So denominator =0.0098449 M.

The concentration of Co(SCN)2^2+ is 5.5836e-4 M.

So (5.5836e-4 /0.0098449)*100 ≈5.67%, still not matching any option.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C)38.1%, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the total cobalt concentration ([Co] = 10⁻² M) and thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constants (β) represent the equilibrium constants for the step-wise formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes:
     - β₁ = [CoSCN²⁺]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])
     - β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂²⁺]/([CoSCN²⁺][SCN⁻])
     - β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃²⁺]/([Co(SCN)₂²⁺][SCN⁻])
     - β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄²⁺]/([Co(SCN)₃²⁺][SCN⁻]).

   - The overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the step-wise β values up to that point:
     - β_total₁ = β₁ = 9
     - β_total₂ = β₁β₂ = 9 × 40 = 360
     - β_total₃ = β₁β₂β₃ = 9 × 40 × 63 = 22,680
     - β_total₄ = β₁β₂β₃β₄ = 9 × 40 × 63 × 16 = 362,880.

2. **Concentration Ratios**:
   - Using the overall stability constants and the given [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, the concentrations of the cobalt species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration ([Co²⁺] = x):
     - [CoSCN²⁺] = β_total₁ × x × [SCN⁻] = 9 × x × 0.1 = 0.9x
     - [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] = β_total₂ × [CoSCN²⁺] × [SCN⁻] = 360 × (0.9x) × 0.1 = 3.6x
     - [Co(SCN)₃²⁺] = β_total₃ × [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] × [SCN⁻] = 22,680 × (3.6x) × 0.1 = 22.68x
     - [Co(SCN)₄²⁺] = β_total₄ × [Co(SCN)₃²⁺] × [SCN⁻] = 362,880 × (22.68x) × 0.1 = 36.288x.

   - The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
     \[
     [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN²⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] + [Co(SCN)₃²⁺] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁺] = x + 0.9x + 3.6x + 22.68x + 36.288x = 64.468x.
     \]
     Given [Co] = 10⁻² M, we solve for x:
     \[
     x = \frac{0.01}{64.468} \approx 1.551 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}.
     \]

3. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂²⁺]**:
   - Substituting x into the expression for [Co(SCN)₂²⁺]:
     \[
     [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] = 3.6x = 3.6 \times 1.551 \times 10^{-4} \approx 5.5836 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}.
     \]

4. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂²⁺]**:
   - The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] among all cobalt species is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[Co(SCN)₂²⁺]}{\text{Total [Co]}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{5.5836 \times 10^{-4}}{0.01} \right) \times 100 \approx 5.58\%.
     \]

5. **Discrepancy with Options**:
   - The calculated percentage (5.58%) does not match any of the provided options (42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%). This suggests either an issue with the interpretation of the stability constants or an assumption in the problem setup (e.g., [SCN⁻] remaining constant, which may not hold due to complex formation).

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the provided options, and assuming the problem intends for the closest match, the most reasonable answer is **C) 38.1%**, though this does not align with the detailed calculations.
