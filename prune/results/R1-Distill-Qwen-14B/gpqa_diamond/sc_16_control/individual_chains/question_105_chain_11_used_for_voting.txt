Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transit.

The question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve. If the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would give the same signal?

Hmm. So, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets relies on the planet passing in front of the star, blocking some light. The depth of the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula is usually (Rp / Rstar)^2. So, if I can find the equivalent effect of the spots, I can set that equal to the planet transit effect and solve for Rp/Rstar.

Wait, but the spots are causing a variation. When the star rotates, the spots come into view or go away, which changes the total brightness. So, the star's brightness without spots would be higher (since spots are cooler and darker) than when spots are on the visible side.

Wait, no. Actually, the spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. So, when the star rotates and the spots are on the front, the total brightness is lower. So, the brightness variation would be a dip when spots are visible. But in the case of a planet transiting, the dip is because the planet blocks some light. So, both cause a dip in brightness, but for different reasons.

Wait, but the question says that the spotted star's brightness variation (due to rotation) would closely resemble that of a planet transit. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as in the planet case.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, to produce the same amplitude, what would be the planet radius relative to the star. So, in other words, without the spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots do.

So I need to compute the relative change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots, and equate that to the change caused by a planet transit.

Wait, but let's think about how the brightness changes in each case.

In the case of the planet transit:

The star's brightness is reduced by the area of the planet over the area of the star. So, delta_flux = (Rp / Rstar)^2.

In the case of the spotted star, the brightness change is due to the spots being cooler. So, when the spots are on the day side (facing us), their lower temperature causes the star's total flux to decrease.

Wait, but how much does this change the overall flux? Let's model it.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (Rstar^2 / (4D^2)), but actually, when calculating the change, the distance D cancels out because we're considering relative changes.

But maybe a better approach is to calculate the fractional change in flux due to the spots.

So, the star has a radius Rstar, and the spots cover a fraction f of the star's surface. Each spot is at a temperature T_spot = Teff - delta_T.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so f = 0.2. So, when the spots are on the hemisphere that's visible, the total flux from the star is reduced because the spots contribute less flux.

Wait, but the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. So, the area of each hemisphere is (2 pi Rstar^2) each? Wait, no. The surface area of a sphere is 4 pi R^2. So each hemisphere is 2 pi R^2.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with spots. So the total area of the star's surface that is spotted is 0.2 * (2 pi Rstar^2) because one hemisphere, which is half the surface area (2 pi R^2). So, the spotted area is (0.2) * (2 pi Rstar^2) = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

But wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So, if the filling factor is 20%, then 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered. The hemisphere's area is 2 pi Rstar^2. So, the spotted area is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

Each part of the star emits according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: flux per unit area is sigma T^4.

So, the total flux when the spots are visible (i.e., the hemisphere with spots is facing us) is:

F_spots_visible = (Area_unspotted * sigma T_eff^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma T_spot^4) )

Area_unspotted = hemisphere area (2 pi R^2) minus the spotted area (0.4 pi R^2) = 1.6 pi R^2.

Wait no, wait. The hemisphere that's not covered by spots is the other hemisphere. No, wait: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is not. Wait, no, I think I might be getting confused.

Wait, the star is a sphere. When the star rotates, the spots on one hemisphere come into view. The hemisphere that's facing us is the one with spots, the other is without.

Wait, no. The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. The one with spots is, say, the front hemisphere (facing us), and the back is spot-free. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is covered, so the other is spot-free.

So, the front hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. So, the front hemisphere's area is 2 pi R^2 (since the front is a hemisphere). The spotted area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So, the front hemisphere's unspotted area is 2 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

The back hemisphere is entirely spot-free, area 2 pi R^2.

So, the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = (1.6 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4.

Wait, no. Wait, when the front hemisphere is the spotted one, the back is the unspotted one. So, the front hemisphere emits from both the unspotted and spotted regions. The back hemisphere is entirely unspotted.

Wait, perhaps that's a mistake. Let me think again.

The front hemisphere (facing us) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So, 20% of 2 pi R^2 is 0.4 pi R^2. So, the front has:

Area_unspotted_front = 2 pi R^2 * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6 pi R^2.

Spotted area: 0.4 pi R^2.

The back hemisphere is spot-free, so it contributes 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4.

So, the total flux when the spots are visible (front hemisphere is facing us) is:

F_spotted = [1.6 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4] + [0.4 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4] + [2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4].

Wait, no. Because the front is 2 pi R^2, the back is 2 pi R^2. When the front is spotted, the front's flux is 1.6 pi R^2 * T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 * T_spot^4. The back is all T_eff, so 2 pi R^2 * T_eff^4. So F_spotted = (1.6 pi R^2 T_eff^4) + (0.4 pi R^2 T_spot^4) + 2 pi R^2 T_eff^4.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the front and back each have 2 pi R^2, so the total surface area is 4 pi R^2. But when the front is the spotted hemisphere, the front's area is 2 pi R^2, of which 0.4 pi R^2 is spotted.

So, I think the correct calculation is:

F_spotted = (2 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4 + (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, that can't be right because the front and back each have 2 pi R^2. So when the front is spotted, the back is fully unspotted.

So, F_spotted = (front unspotted) + (front spotted) + (back unspotted).

Wait, no. The front is 2 pi R^2. Of that, 0.2 (20%) is spotted. So, front unspotted is 1.6 pi R^2.

So,

F_spotted = [1.6 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4] + [0.4 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4] (from front) + [2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4] (from back).

Wait, but wait, the front and back each have 2 pi R^2. So when front is spotted, the front is 2 pi R^2, with 0.4 pi R^2 spotted. The back is 2 pi R^2, all unspotted.

So, F_spotted = [1.6 pi R^2 * T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 * T_spot^4] (front) + [2 pi R^2 * T_eff^4] (back).

So, F_spotted = (1.6 + 0.4 T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) * pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, maybe it's better to factor this. Let me factor out pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

F_spotted = pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 [ (1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) + 2 ]

Because the front contributes 1.6 pi R^2 T_eff^4 and 0.4 pi R^2 T_spot^4. The back contributes 2 pi R^2 T_eff^4.

So,

F_spotted = pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 * [ (1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) + 2 ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

1.6 + 2 = 3.6. So,

F_spotted = pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 [3.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

But wait, let me re-do that calculation. Front is 1.6 pi R^2 T_eff^4, front spotted is 0.4 pi R^2 T_spot^4, and back is 2 pi R^2 T_eff^4.

So, F_spotted = [1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ] * pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, let me express all terms in terms of pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

The first term is (1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) * pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

The second term is 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

So F_spotted = [1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) + 2 ] * pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4

So that's [3.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ] * pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

But the normal flux (F0) without any spots would be the flux when the spotted hemisphere is not facing us. So, the front is unspotted, and the back is unspotted.

Wait, no. Wait, in the scenario where the star isn't spotted, the star emits uniformly. But in the current scenario, when the spotted hemisphere is on the back side, the front is unspotted. So F0 (the normal flux without any spots) would be when the front is entirely unspotted, so the entire star is emitting at Teff.

Wait, no. No, the star's overall flux is when all the surface is at Teff. But in the spotted case, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the star's total flux without spots. Without spots, the entire star emits at Teff. So, F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

In the situation where the star has spots, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted, which is less than F0.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere isn't visible, the flux is F_unspotted_side = F0.

Wait, no, because the spots are on the other side. So when the spotted hemisphere is on the back, the front is all unspotted, so the flux is F0.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When the star has spots covering 20% of a hemisphere, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F_spotted, and when it's not, the flux is F_unspotted, which is F0.

Wait, no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is less than F0. When it's not, the flux is F0.

So, the variation in brightness is F0 - F_spotted.

Wait, no, because when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere, the flux is F_spotted, which is less than F0. So the change is F0 - F_spotted.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude in the light curve. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, but for a star with spots, the maximum brightness is F0 (when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us), and the minimum is F_spotted (when the spotted hemisphere is facing us). So the amplitude (the depth of the dip) is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

So, the fractional change is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

Now, for the planet transit, the fractional change is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

So, we set these two equal and solve for (Rp / Rstar).

So, let's calculate (F0 - F_spotted)/F0.

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

F_spotted is given as:

F_spotted = [1.6 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4] + [0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4] + [2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4].

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front is 2 pi R^2, with 0.4 pi R^2 spotted. The back is 2 pi R^2 unspotted.

Wait, in that case:

F_spotted = (front unspotted) + (front spotted) + (back unspotted)

= [1.6 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4] + [0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4] + [2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4]

= (1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) * pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

Hmm, maybe I should factor this out differently.

Let me compute F_spotted:

F_spotted = (front unspotted) + (front spotted) + (back unspotted)
= (1.6 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4) + (0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4) + (2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4)
= [1.6 + 2] pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot^4)
= 3.6 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot^4)

But F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

So, F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

So, the difference is F0 - F_spotted = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - [3.6 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot^4) ]

= (4 - 3.6) pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot^4)
= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot^4)
= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So, fractional change is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = [0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

The pi, R^2, sigma terms cancel out.

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / (4 Teff^4 )
= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / (4 Teff^4 )
= (0.4 /4 ) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )
= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

So, fractional change is 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Now, plug in the values. Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4) = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

0.8333^4 = ?

Well, 0.8^4 is 0.4096. 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

But let me calculate more accurately.

(5/6) = 0.833333...

(0.833333)^4 = ?

Calculating step by step:

0.833333^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694444.

Then, 0.694444^2 = (25/36)^2 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So, (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ≈ 0.482253.

So, 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So, fractional change is 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747.

So, the fractional change (delta) is approximately 0.05177, or about 5.177% of the star's brightness.

Now, the planet transit would cause a fractional change of (Rp / Rstar)^2.

So, set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(0.04) is 0.2, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.05177 is about 5.177e-2.

sqrt(5.177e-2) = let's think in terms of 0.228.

Wait, 0.228^2 = 0.051984. That's very close to 0.05177. So sqrt(0.05177) = approximately 0.2275.

So, Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but that's about 0.23. Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, none of these are close to 0.23. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait a second, perhaps I made an error in calculating F_spotted.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I messed up somewhere earlier.

Wait, when we calculated F_spotted, perhaps I made a mistake in the areas.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4 pi R^2. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front is 2 pi R^2. Of that, 20% is spotted, so 0.4 pi R^2, and the rest is 1.6 pi R^2.

The back is 2 pi R^2, all unspotted.

So, F_spotted = (front unspotted) + (front spotted) + (back unspotted).

Wait, but front unspotted is 1.6 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4.

Front spotted is 0.4 pi R^2 * sigma (5000)^4.

Back unspotted is 2 pi R^2 * sigma (6000)^4.

So, F_spotted = [1.6 + 0.4*(5000^4/6000^4) + 2] * pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, so inside the brackets:

1.6 + 2 = 3.6, plus 0.4*(5000/6000)^4.

So, F_spotted = [3.6 + 0.4*(0.482253)] * pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

Compute 0.4 * 0.482253 = 0.192901.

So, 3.6 + 0.192901 = 3.792901.

So, F_spotted = 3.792901 * pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

But F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

So, F0 - F_spotted = [4 - 3.792901] pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 = 0.207099 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

Thus, fractional change (delta) = (0.207099 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 ) ) = 0.207099 /4 = 0.05177. So, same as before.

So, fractional change is 0.05177, which is about 5.177% of the total flux.

So, the planet transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have anything near 0.23. The closest option is D) ~0.32, which is 0.32, which is about 10% of the star's radius. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of F_spotted. Maybe I should have considered only the front hemisphere when the spots are in view. Alternatively, perhaps I should have modeled the flux correctly.

Wait, another approach: the change in flux when the spots are on the visible side is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

Wait, when the spots are on the visible side, the flux is F_spotted, which is the sum of the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's flux when the spots are visible as:

F_spotted = F_unspotted_hemisphere + F_spotted_hemisphere.

Wait, but each hemisphere is 2 pi R^2 in area.

So, the unspotted hemisphere (facing us) would have an area of 2 pi R^2 minus the spots: 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

The spotted area on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So, the front contributes:

(1.6 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) * sigma (5000)^4.

The back hemisphere is entirely unspotted, so 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4.

So, the total flux is:

F_spotted = [1.6 pi R^2 T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 (5000)^4 ] + [2 pi R^2 T_eff^4 ].

Which is the same as:

F_spotted = (1.6 + 2) pi R^2 T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 (5000)^4.

= 3.6 pi R^2 T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 (5000)^4.

F0 is 4 pi R^2 T_eff^4.

So, the difference is F0 - F_spotted = (4 -3.6) pi R^2 T_eff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 (5000)^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 T_eff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 (5000)^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 [ T_eff^4 - (5000)^4 ].

So, fractional change is [0.4 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 T_eff^4 )

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

= 0.1 [ (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.1 [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is the same as before, 0.1*(1 - 0.482253) = 0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.05177.

So, same as before. So, the fractional change is about 5.177%.

So to get the same dip, the planet's area must block 5.177% of the star's light.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm. So, about 0.23 Rstar.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option close to 0.23. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the interpretation of the problem. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the problem says that the spots cover one hemisphere, and the other is spot-free. So when the star rotates and the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness decreases.

Wait, but when the star isn't spotted, the brightness would be F0. But the observed variation is F0 - F_spotted.

But the question is asking, to produce the same amplitude, what planet radius would cause that dip. So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177, so Rp is about 0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the problem differently. Perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. So, filling factor f = 20% means 20% of the entire star is covered. So, area = 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me try this.

If the filling factor is 20%, and the star has radius R, then the spotted area is 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

But the star is split into two hemispheres. So, when the star rotates, the spotted area may be on either hemisphere.

Wait, but the question says that only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So, the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So, the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, maybe I should consider that not the entire hemisphere is covered, but just a part of it.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is applied to the entire star. So, if the filling factor is 20%, then 0.2 of the entire surface is covered by spots. So, area = 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

In that case, when the star is viewed, the spots may be on the front or the back, but the maximum effect is when the spots are on the front.

Wait, but the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty, so the other is not. So, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So, 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Hmm. Since the options don't include ~0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, let me recompute the fractional change.

delta = (F0 - F_spotted)/F0.

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

F_spotted = (front unspotted) + (front spotted) + (back unspotted).

front unspotted area: 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

front spotted area: 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

back unspotted area: 2 pi R^2.

So,

F_spotted = [1.6 pi R^2 sigma T^4] + [0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4 ] + [2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 ]

= (1.6 + 2) pi R^2 sigma T^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4.

= 3.6 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4.

So,

F0 - F_spotted = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 - [3.6 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4 ]

= (4 -3.6) pi R^2 sigma T^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma [ T^4 - (T_spot)^4 ].

Then,

delta = [0.4 (T^4 - T_spot^4)] / (4 T^4 )

= 0.1 [ 1 - ( T_spot^4 / T^4 ) ]

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between when the spots are on the front and when they are on the back. So, the maximum dip is when the spots are on the front, and the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the back (so the spots are not visible). So, the amplitude would be (F0 - F_spotted) / F0 = 0.05177.

So, we need a planet that would cause the same dip. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp ~0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the variation as the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, which is F0 - F_spotted.

So, if the star without spots would have F0, but when the spots are visible (front), F_spotted is lower. So when the star rotates, the brightness varies between F0 and F_spotted.

Wait, but earlier calculations show that F_spotted is when the spotted hemisphere is visible. When the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0 (all unspotted).

Wait, no. Because the other hemisphere is also unspotted. So, when the spotted hemisphere is on the back, the front is unspotted, so the flux is F0.

So, the variation in brightness is F0 (when unspotted hemisphere is visible) and F_spotted (when spotted hemisphere is visible). So, the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0 = 0.05177, which is about 5.177% of the star's brightness.

So, the planet must block 5.177% of the star's light, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options are close to 0.23. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the entire star's flux, but only the hemisphere. So, when the star is not spotted, the entire star is emitting. When the star is spotted, the front half has spots and the back is unspotted.

Wait, maybe I should model the star as a disk, with one hemisphere covered. So, the area of the star is 2 pi R^2 (as a disk), and the spots cover 20% of that.

Wait, but I think that approach would be the same as considering the entire sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the front, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So, the amplitude is the maximum dip in brightness.

Wait, perhaps the way the problem is presented, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K. So, the flux from the spots is less than the rest of the star.

But perhaps I should compute the average flux when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, when the spots are on the front, the flux is F_spotted.

When they are on the back, the flux is F0.

So, the maximum brightness is F0, the minimum is F_spotted, so the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = 0.05177.

But given the options, I must have made an error. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in flux as the difference between when the spots are on the front and when they're on the back.

Wait, no. That would be the same as the amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the flux as a function of the area blocked and the temperature difference.

Wait, another approach: the change in flux when the spots are visible is the area of the spots (as seen from Earth) multiplied by the temperature difference.

Wait, but no. The flux is proportional to the area times the temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the fractional change as the sum of the area of the spots multiplied by their lower temperature contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to model the variation in brightness as a simple area effect.

Wait, when the star isn't spotted, the flux is F0.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F0 minus the flux lost due to the spots being cooler.

The flux lost is the area of the spots multiplied by (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) times sigma.

But the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 0.2 * (pi R^2) (since spots are on one hemisphere, which is half the area of the sphere).

Wait, no. The area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So, the flux lost is 0.4 pi R^2 * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Then, the fractional change is (flux lost) / F0.

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So,

delta = [0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [4 pi R^2 Teff^4 ].

The pi R^2 terms cancel.

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 Teff^4 )

= [0.4 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ] /4

= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Which brings us back to the same calculation. So, same fractional change as before, 0.05177, so ~5.177%.

So, back to the same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the equivalent planet size based on the maximum dip, which is 5.177%, so Rp/Rstar ~ 0.227. But given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the change in brightness when the spots are on the front, but perhaps I forgot that when the star is rotating, the spots might only cover a part of the disk. Or perhaps a different approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the star's rotation and the spot's area, and that the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, which is when the spots are fully in view or hidden.

Wait, but according to the previous calculation, the amplitude is 0.05177.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip relative to the star's unspotted state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative brightness variation in terms of the change in the area times the change in temperature. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the brightness variation as the ratio of the area of the spots to the area of the entire star. So, 0.2 of the star's surface is covered, so the dip is 0.2. But that's not correct because the spots are cooler, not completely black.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the area of the spots relative to the star's disk as seen from Earth.

Wait, when the star is viewed, the area of the spots is 0.2 of the front hemisphere. So, 0.2 * (pi R^2) = 0.2 pi R^2. The total area of the star's disk is pi R^2. So, the dip due to the planet is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2), which is what we're solving for.

But in the case of the spots, the dip is (0.2 pi R^2) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4). Hmm, no, that's not the correct approach.

Wait, considering that the spots are cooler, the flux from the spotted area is less than the surrounding. So, the total flux when the spots are visible is F0 minus the deficit caused by the spots.

But perhaps I should model it as:

The flux deficit = (area of spots) * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) * sigma.

So, delta = (flux deficit) / F0.

Flux deficit = (0.2 * 2 pi R^2) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma.

Wait, because the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So,

delta = [0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma ] / [4 pi R^2 Teff^4 sigma ]

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [4 Teff^4 ]

= 0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) 

Same as before.

So, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the full effect of the spots. Maybe the star's brightness variation is only due to the spots blocking light, not their lower temperature. But that doesn't make sense because the question says the spots are cooler. So, the lower temperature would reduce the flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot area as a blackbody, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the equivalent area in terms of the planet's area.

Let me think: the planet's area is (pi Rp^2). The star's area is (pi Rstar^2).

The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So, the dip is 0.05177, so Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, ~0.23.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip as (R_spot_area / Rstar^2), but that's not quite right.

Wait, the area of the spots is 0.2 of the star's surface (if filling factor is 20% of the entire star). So, area is 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

So, when the spots are on the front, the area blocking is 0.4 pi R^2 (since it's a hemisphere with 20% coverage).

Wait, but perhaps the flux dip is due to the area of the spots, which is 0.4 pi R^2 * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4).

Wait, that's not correct because the flux depends on T^4.

Alternatively, the dip is (area of spots) / (area of star) ) multiplied by (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4).

Wait, but no, because the flux from the spots is (area * T_spot^4), so the difference is (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * area.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as the difference between the spotted and unspotted states as a fraction of the star's total flux.

Wait, but I think I've tried that already.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Wait, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 = ?

0.8333^2 = 0.6944.

0.6944^2 = 0.482253.

So, that's correct.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum possible brightness variation, which would be when the entire star is covered by spots. But no, the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered, so the maximum variation is when the spots are on the front.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So, 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view. So, when the spots are on the front, the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 0.4 pi R^2.

Hmm, but the calculation would still proceed as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the star's brightness when the spots are on the front and when they're on the back. The maximum brightness is when the spots are on the back, and the minimum when on the front.

Wait, no, when the spots are on the back, the front is unspotted, so the flux is F0.

When the spots are on the front, the flux is F_spotted, which is lower.

So, the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = 0.05177.

So, the planet's effect would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps instead of looking at the entire star, the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are on the front versus when they're on the back. But that's what I already did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as causing a continuous variation as the star rotates, not a step function between F0 and F_spotted.

But no, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view in a step-like fashion.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's rotation period, and the time it takes for the spots to come into view, but that's not relevant to the amplitude calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux based on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

So, the fractional change is (area of spots) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ).

So, area of spots is 0.4 pi R^2.

So,

delta = (0.4 pi R^2) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 )

= 0.4 * (1 - 0.482253) /4

= (0.4 * 0.517747)/4

= 0.2070988 /4 = 0.05177.

Same result.

Hmm.

So, all approaches lead to the same conclusion: the planet needs to have a radius of about 0.227 Rstar to produce the same dip.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots.

Let me think: the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun.

One hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%.

Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots.

So, area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2.

Filling factor of 20% → area of spots on the hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So, when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 0.4 pi R^2.

But the total area of the star's disk is pi R^2.

So, the spots cover 0.4 pi R^2 / pi R^2 = 0.4, or 40% of the disk's area.

But when the spots are cooler, the flux from that area is (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) times the flux from the rest.

Wait, but that doesn't directly translate to the area, because the flux isn't just area multiplied by a factor, but by T^4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in flux as the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in their temperature. So, the dip is (0.4) * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4.

Wait, but that would be:

dip = (0.4) * ( (5000^4 -6000^4) /6000^4 )

= 0.4 * ( (1 - (6000/5000)^4 ) )

Wait, that would be negative, but the dip is positive, so maybe (6000/5000)^4 is larger than 1.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute.

(6000/5000) = 1.2 → (1.2)^4 = 2.0736.

So, 0.4 * (1 - 2.0736) = 0.4 * (-1.0736) → negative, which doesn't make sense because the dip is a decrease in flux.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

dip = (area of spots) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) / (total area of star)

= (0.4 pi R^2) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 )

= 0.4 * (1 - 0.482253) /4.

= 0.4 * 0.517747 /4.

= 0.2070988 /4 = 0.05177.

Same as before.

So, dip of ~5.177%.

Hmm.

Well, given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the spots to be on the entire star, not just one hemisphere.

Wait, if the entire star has a filling factor of 20% spots, then the area of spots is 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view, but their effect would be the same regardless of rotation because the entire star is spotted. So, the brightness would have a dip when the spots are on the front, but that scenario is different from the given problem.

But the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty, so that approach doesn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the planet radius based on the spot's area as a fraction of the star's area, ignoring the temperature difference.

So, the dip would be 0.4 * (5000^4 / 6000^4 ) = 0.4 * (5/6)^4 = 0.4 * 0.482253 = 0.1929.

So, dip is 0.1929 → (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1929 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.439. But that's option A (0.39), but that's close to 0.439, but not exact.

Wait, but that approach is incorrect because it ignores the temperature difference. The spots don't completely block the light; they just emit less.

Wait, but if the problem expects that approach, perhaps the answer would be approximately 0.439, which is option A (0.39), but that's not quite matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as considering the brightness change as (1 - f) where f is the filling factor, but that's without considering temperature.

In that case, f=0.2 → dip of 0.2, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.2 → Rp/Rstar= ~0.447, which is close to option A (0.39), but not exact.

But that approach doesn't account for the fact that the spots are cooler, not completely dark.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots cause a change in brightness of f*(1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ), where f is the filling factor of the entire star.

So, f=0.2 → dip is 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218 → ~0.32. So, option D is 0.32.

Ah, that's one of the options.

Wait, but why would the filling factor be applied to the entire star? The problem says only one hemisphere is covered.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the correct approach for the problem is that the filling factor is applied to the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

So, the area of spots is f * 4 pi R^2 = 0.2 *4 pi R^2= 0.8 pi R^2.

Then, the dip would be (area of spots) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) / (4 pi R^2 )

= [0.8 pi R^2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ] / [4 pi R^2 ]

= 0.8 * (0.517747) /4.

= 0.4141976 /4 ≈ 0.10355.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → ~0.32.

Which matches option D.

So, perhaps the problem expects the filling factor to be applied to the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

In that case, the correct answer would be option D, ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in flux caused by the spots and equate it to the flux change caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 20\% \).
   - Spots are cooler: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Planet Transit**:
   - The fractional change in flux during a transit is proportional to \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).

3. **Spot-Induced Brightness Variation**:
   - The spotted hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the spots cover \( f \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The total flux without spots is \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \left( 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right) + \left( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right) + \left( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right).
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = 3.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4.
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_0}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \):
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Plugging in \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Calculating \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253 \):
     \[
     \Delta F \approx 0.1 \times (1 - 0.482253) = 0.05177.
     \]

4. **Equating to Planet Transit**:
   - The fractional change in flux during a transit is \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).
   - Setting \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.05177 \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

5. **Revisiting the Options**:
   - The calculated value \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options.
   - To reconcile with the options, consider the filling factor \( f = 20\% \) applied to the entire star's surface:
     \[
     \Delta F = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
     Substituting \( f = 0.2 \):
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.482253) = 0.10355.
     \]
   - Setting \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.10355 \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \), which matches option **D**.

Answer: D
