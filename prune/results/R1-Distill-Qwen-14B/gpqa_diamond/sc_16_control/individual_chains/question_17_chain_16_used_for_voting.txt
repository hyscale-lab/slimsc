Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this.

The problem says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, okay, so what's a formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion from its constituent ions. So in this case, the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- , right? And Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric means that the ratio of the ions is exactly 1:1, so all the Ca²+ is bound into the complex, right? So in this case, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M because that's the concentration of the solution provided.

Wait, but is that the case? Or do I have to consider some dissociation? Hmm. Well, the K is given, so maybe I should think in terms of the K expression. If the solution is stoichiometric, perhaps it's assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, in reality, the K is very large, which means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal.

So let me think. The complex is CaEDTA^2- which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, according to the K expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in a 1:1 complex, the concentration of the complex is equal to the sum of the concentrations of the individual ions. Or wait no, the complex forms when Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine. If the solution is stoichiometric, meaning that all possible Ca²+ and EDTA^4- have formed the complex, then the initial concentrations would have been equal. But in a solution, if we have a 0.02 M solution of the complex, that implies that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But in reality, some of this complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but for the problem, since K is very large, the amount of dissociation would be so small that it's negligible. So [Ca²+] would be approximately equal to [EDTA^4-], and both would be much smaller than [CaEDTA^2-]. So, is there a way to approximate this?

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. The complex concentration is 0.02 - x, but since x is so small (because K is big), 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Wait, but wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, the total concentration of all species (complex, Ca²+, EDTA^4-) should add up to 0.02 M? Or does the stoichiometric solution imply that initially, before any complexation, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 M, and they form the complex, but not entirely.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. When you have a solution of the complex, say, CaEDTA^2-, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let’s say the dissociation is x, so:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small).

So plugging into the Kf equation:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

So solve for x.

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13.

Wait, no:

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x squared is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Hmm, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Let me see: 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, and squared is 1e-13 approx. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13)= sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) )= 2 * 1e-6.5 (since sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5), which is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 6.5 is 13/2. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * (3.16e-7) )= approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate:

Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Assuming [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So,

5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)

x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = same as before.

Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13, right? Because 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So yes, same as earlier.

So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7 M. So option C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the complex is stable (\(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) is very large), the dissociation is minimal, and the concentration of the complex remains approximately \(0.02 \, \text{M}\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
