Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the IR and NMR data provided.

First, let me think about what reaction occurs when a compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes. So the reaction would convert a ketone group (C=O) into a CH2 group. Alternatively, sometimes it's used to reduce aldehydes, but in this case, the presence of HI might be a clue. Wait, actually, in Clemmensen, the reagent is usually HCl with red phosphorus. But wait, some sources say that HI can also be used, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction, like maybe the reduction of esters or something else. Hmm, wait, maybe I should first analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is, and then think about the reaction.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH stretch, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and possibly an -OH group.

Looking at the NMR data: Let's go through each peak.

The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating for 1H. Broad usually suggests an -OH proton, but the integration is 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be around 10-12 ppm and broad. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the proton is around 9-10 ppm, but singlet. But in this case, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, could it be an -NH proton, but that's less likely here.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each for 2H mean that there are two substituents on the benzene ring, probably in para positions. The coupling between the aromatic protons would lead to these doublets. So, for example, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on each substituent would couple with each other, but since they're para, each group is opposite, leading to each set of protons being a doublet.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet integrating for 1H. That's somewhere in the middle region. Maybe a methylene group adjacent to something, perhaps next to an oxygen or a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), two protons in a multiplet. That could be another set of CH2 groups. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, a doublet? Wait, no, the notation is d, which is a doublet. Wait, but 3H as a doublet and at 1.4 ppm. That's typical of a methyl group adjacent to a chiral center, maybe a CH(CH3) group or something. Alternatively, it's a methyl attached to something else. Then, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which is usually a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH2CH3. So maybe an ethyl group at the end.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. Let's say substituents at positions 1 and 4. One substituent is an ethyl group, maybe (since there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm), but wait, the substituents on the benzene ring would be more like a side chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, from the IR, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. Carboxylic acid carbonyls are usually broader and around 1700 cm-1 but can be a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or ketone. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show both the O-H and the C=O. Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which could be an ester or a ketone. But the 3400–2500 cm-1 might be an -OH, so perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let me think again. The IR has a broad peak from 3400 to 2500, which is a wide range. That could suggest an -OH, but it could also be an -NH stretch. But given the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid -OH than an alcohol. So perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Let's think about the structure. The aromatic ring has substituents in para positions. So, perhaps a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent. Let's say, for example, 4-ethylbenzoic acid. But let me check the NMR.

The aromatic protons: if the ring has two substituents in para positions, like COOH and another group, then the protons on the ring would be in a para arrangement. The NMR shows two doublets: 8.0 (d, J?) and 7.2 (d, J?). In para-substituted benzene rings, the coupling between the protons is typically between adjacent protons, but the splitting depends on the substituents. Wait, if one substituent is strongly activating (like -COOH, which is deactivating), the ring's electronic environment changes. Alternatively, if one substituent is an electron-donating group, the ring protons would have different shifts.

Wait, but the substituent in para positions could be an ethyl group. So, if the ring has COOH at position 1 and an ethyl group at position 4, but wait, the ethyl group would be an -OCH2CH3 or perhaps a simple -CH2CH2... No, wait, ethyl as a substituent would have its own structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a chain, like a ketone. Wait, but the IR has 1720 which is more like an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a side chain. Let's think about the NMR.

In the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That looks like a chain. Let me try to outline the structure.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, perhaps in a branched position.

Putting this together: perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group or something like that. Wait, maybe it's a butyl group. Let me think of a substituent like a propan-2-yl group or something similar.

Wait, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a chain that includes a carbonyl. For example, if the benzene ring has a substituent like -CO-R, where R is a chain leading to an ethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain that has a carbonyl group. Suppose the substituent is a propionyl group (like CH2CH2COOH). Hmm, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. Let me think: the IR has 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone. Then, the NMR would have a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think of the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a methine (CH) group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a methyl group attached to the CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be an ethyl group attached further away.

Wait, maybe it's a structure like CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Or perhaps a structure where the benzene ring has a substituent such as -CO-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The NMR shows:

10.5 ppm: -OH (maybe a carboxylic acid)
Aromatic protons: two doublets, para substitution.
Other peaks: 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), 0.9 (3H, t).

So, let's think of a group attached to the benzene that has a chain leading to a methyl group and an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Alternatively, it's a propyl chain with a branch.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options given. Maybe that can help.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the options are products after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, but the reaction affects the starting material, Compound X. So, to figure out the product, I need to first know what X is.

But perhaps I can look at the options and see which fit the IR and NMR data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Let me see. Benzoic acid has a COOH group on the benzene. The IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1, which matches the 1720 cm-1. The O-H stretch from the acid would be around 3000-2500 cm-1 (broad), which is present in the IR.

The NMR would have an aromatic region. If the substituents are COOH and a sec-butyl group in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let's see:

The benzoic acid would have two substituents in para positions. So, the protons on the ring would be at positions 2 and 6 (if substituents are at 1 and 4). Those protons would be equivalent, so each would be a doublet. The coupling between the two sets of protons would give each a doublet. So, that would fit the NMR data.

The other NMR peaks would correspond to the side chain. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, sec-butyl is -CH2CH2CH(CH3), no. Wait, no. Let me clarify: The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, no. The butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no, because the butyl group is four carbons. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituents.

Wait, the substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with -COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The structure of the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the chain as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain where the branching is on the second carbon.

Now, in the NMR, the protons on the chain would be:

The CH2 group attached to the benzene would have protons. The next CH (attached to the benzene's CH2) would have a CH which is next to a branching point. Let me see.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure is: -O-CO-phenyl group attached to a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, no. The substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Let me break it down.

The substituent would be:

Benzene ring – COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH2CH3). So, the chain is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So, looking at the NMR:

The CH2 attached to the benzene would have two protons. But the peak at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could correspond to the CH2 next to the branching. The CH group (the branching point) would have one proton, which is the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH2CH3 group would have the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H). And the CH3 attached to the branching point (the methyl group in the branch) would be the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

Wait, but the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH2 next to the benzene would have two protons, perhaps at around 1.7 ppm. The CH in the middle would have one proton, perhaps around 2.9 ppm. The CH2CH3 group would be the ethyl at the end, giving the 0.9 ppm triplet. The CH3 in the branch (the one attached to the CH) would be a methyl group attached to the CH, so it would be a triplet? No, wait, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group (CH3) attached to it. So, the CH3 would be split into a doublet because it's attached to a CH that is connected to another CH2 group. Hmm, maybe the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is that CH3.

Putting this together:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, that would be:

Phenyl-COOH (at position 1), and at position 4, a substituent -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In that case, the NMR would have:

The benzene's aromatic protons: two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2, which matches.

The -COOH would give the 10.5 ppm peak.

The CH2 group attached to the benzene (position 4) would have two protons. Their NMR peak would be around 2.5-3.0 ppm perhaps. But in the data, the peak at 2.9 ppm is only 1H. Hmm, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is split into two peaks, but the data shows a multiplet for 1H. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think again.

Another option: the substituent is a propyl group with branching. The NMR shows a 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which might be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be CH2 groups. Then, the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (3H, t) would be an ethyl group.

Putting that together, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. As I thought earlier, that's likely the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So, if X has a ketone group, the product would have that group reduced.

So, let's consider Compound X as having a ketone group. Then, upon reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, but looking at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone. So, if X is a ketone, then the product would have that converted to a CH2 group.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, the reduction might do something else. Wait, no. Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes, I think. Esters are typically reduced under different conditions, perhaps with LAH or other reagents.

So, if X is a ketone, the product after reduction would have that carbonyl group replaced by a CH2 group.

So, the NMR data of X would have a carbonyl group, showing up around 1720 cm-1, and in the NMR, perhaps a triplet or some splitting from the adjacent groups.

Wait, let me try to model this. Suppose X is a benzophenone derivative, but with substituents. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps X is a substituted acetophenone.

Wait, suppose X is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. Then, upon reduction, the ketone (acetophenone part) would become a CH2 group, leading to 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene or something like that.

Wait, but let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But if X is a ketone, then after reduction, it wouldn't be a carboxylic acid anymore. So perhaps X is a benzaldehyde or something else.

Wait, maybe X is a benzophenone with substituents. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: let's analyze the NMR of the starting material (Compound X). The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton, but that would be a triplet or something else. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction conditions with red phosphorus and HI might not be a Clemmensen. Because Clemmensen is for reduction, but maybe I'm getting mixed up with other reagents. Wait, what's another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI?

Oh, wait, another possibility is that red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of esters to alkanes, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of nitriles or another functional group. Alternatively, it could be the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that's probably not.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester. Let me think. If X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might reduce it. For example, esters can be reduced to alkanes using H2 and a catalyst, but I'm not sure about red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, maybe X is an acid chloride, but that's less likely given the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine. But again, I'm not sure about the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the Hofmann degradation, but that typically involves a different set of reagents like Cl2 and NaOH.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate the reaction. Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for the elimination of CO2 from carbonyl groups to form alkanes. Wait, no, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and heat with a strong base, but maybe under certain conditions, other reagents can be used.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol, but that's done with different reagents, like NaBH4 or LiAlH4.

Wait, going back. Clemmensen reduction is specifically for reducing ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. The reagents are Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, but sometimes other HX acids are used. So, if X has a ketone group, upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI (maybe acting as an acid), the ketone is reduced to an alkane.

So, the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

So, let's assume X is a ketone. Then, the product after reaction would have a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, only option A and C have a carboxylic acid group. So, perhaps X is a ketone adjacent to a chain that leads to a benzene ring with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. Then, upon reduction, the acetophenone becomes ethylbenzene. So, the product would be 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene, but that's not an option here.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is a ketone, then after reduction, it would become an alkane, which wouldn't have a carboxylic acid.

So perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative with a ketone group elsewhere. Wait, that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction reduces it to a benzyl group.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached. So, the structure is Ph-CH2-COOH, where Ph is a phenyl group with an ethyl substituent.

But wait, in that structure, the substituents would be a 4-ethylphenyl group and a propanoic acid. So, the benzene ring would have an ethyl group at position 4, and the propanoic acid's CH2 would be attached at position 2 (since it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl)).

But how would X look before reduction? If X is a benzaldehyde with a side chain leading to a ketone, then after reduction, it becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes a ketone. That's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has a ketone. Then, the reaction would reduce both the benzaldehyde and the ketone to CH2 groups.

But I'm getting stuck, so let me try another approach.

Looking at the NMR of X, the aromatic region is two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid. So, if X is a benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would need to be something else. Because Clemmensen reduces ketones, not carboxylic acids.

Wait, but carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under Clemmensen conditions. They are generally not reactive towards those reagents. So, perhaps the reaction is not a Clemmensen reduction but something else.

Wait, another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the hydrohalogenation or perhaps the deoxygenation of an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of a nitrile.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be the reduction of a nitrile to an amine. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, let's think again. The IR has a broad peak in 3400–2500, which could be an -OH, but if X is a nitrile, perhaps the peak is from an alcohol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR is showing an -OH from a carboxylic acid. Then, why would X react with red phosphorus and HI? Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is an ester. The IR would have the carbonyl around 1720. The ester group would absorb around 1720. The O-H in the IR could be from a carboxylic acid, but if X is an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. Esters typically don't have protons that absorb that highly. Unless it's an alpha-proton, but that's usually around 2-3 ppm.

Wait, perhaps X is a beta-keto acid. Beta-keto acids have both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. So, IR would show the ketone at ~1720 cm-1 and the O-H from the carboxylic acid at 10.5 ppm.

In that case, the structure would be something like benzene ring with a -COCH2COOH group. But then, the NMR would need to fit that.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene would be a -COCH2COOH group. That's possible, but the NMR data would have to support that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes an ethyl group. So, after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option and see if any fit the data.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid group at position 2.

So, the benzene has substituents at positions 2 and 4. So, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3 and 5. Wait, but if substituents are at 2 and 4, then the ring has substituents in ortho and para positions, which might lead to more complex splitting than two doublets. So the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted ring, perhaps with two substituents in para. So, maybe this isn't the structure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, the substituents are at 1 and 4, so positions 2 and 6 would have one set of protons, and positions 3 and 5 another. So the NMR would show two doublets, which fits.

The NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That fits a para-substituted ring with two substituents.

- The 10.5 ppm peak would be the -COOH proton.

- The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would contribute the other NMR signals.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So, the chain would be:

Ph-COOH (position 1) and Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) (position 4).

The NMR would then have:

The CH2 next to the benzene (position 4) would have two protons, perhaps around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would have one proton, perhaps around 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

The CH2CH3 group (from the substituent) would have three protons at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), since it's a methyl group attached to a CH.

So, putting it all together, the NMR would match.

Now, what happens when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

If X is the benzoic acid, then the reaction might not be a Clemmensen reduction because benzoic acids are not ketones. So perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the reaction is not a reduction but something else.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to remove oxygen from certain groups. For example, in the dehydrohalogenation or in the formation of alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X has a side chain with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a benzoic acid group. Then, upon reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, leading to a longer chain.

So, if X is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone, then after reduction, it becomes 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a ketone. Then, upon reduction, both groups would be converted to CH2 groups.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

If X is a benzaldehyde (PhCHO), then the reaction would reduce it to PhCH2OH (benzyl alcohol). But that doesn't fit any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes an ethyl group, leading to a longer chain after reduction.

Wait, perhaps X is something like 4-ethylacetophenone (PhCOCH2CH2CH2CH3). Then, upon reduction with Clemmensen, it would become PhCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's not an option.

Looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl substituents. But that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have a sec-butyl and a methyl group in para positions. Again, doesn't fit the NMR.

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely a deoxygenation or a reduction. If the starting material has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, it would be reduced to an alkane.

So, if X has a ketone, the product would have a CH2 group. So, looking at the options, option A is a propanoic acid. Option C is a benzoic acid. So, unless X is a ketone adjacent to a chain that, upon reduction, becomes a CH2 group, leading to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes a ketone. Let me think.

Suppose X is 4-(propan-2-yl)benzaldehyde. Then, upon reduction, the aldehyde would become a CH2 group, and the ketone would become another CH2. So the product would be 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, and that substituent also has a chain leading to an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(3-oxopropyl)benzaldehyde. Then, upon reduction, both the aldehyde and the ketone are reduced to CH2 groups. The product would be 4-(3-(CH2)2)benzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that is a propyl group. Then, the product would be a benzyl group attached to a propyl group.

Wait, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an elimination. For example, if X has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction would form an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If X is an ester, the reaction could hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure how red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, red phosphorus is often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, like the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions. So, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI (acidic conditions) would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

If that's the case, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids.

So, let's consider that scenario. X is an ester. Let's say it's a methyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid. Then, upon hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the NMR of X would then have an ester group (O-CO-O), which would show up around 1720 cm-1 in the IR. The ester's alkoxy group (OCH3, for example) would show up in the NMR as a singlet around 3.7 ppm. But the NMR data provided doesn't show such a peak. So, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone ester. Then, upon hydrolysis, it would form a carboxylic acid.

But I'm getting a bit stuck again. Maybe I should think that the reaction is a reduction, and X is a ketone.

So, X is a ketone. The product after reduction is an alkane.

Looking at the options, only option C is a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps X is not a ketone but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an elimination. For example, X has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, and upon treatment with acid, it loses water to form an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a nitrile. Nitriles can be reduced to amines using certain reagents. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI does that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne. Under certain conditions, alkynes can be reduced to alkenes or alkanes. But again, I'm not sure about the reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the Staudinger reaction, but that involves triphenylphosphine and azides, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is an aldehyde with a substituent that includes a ketone. Then, reducing both would form a CH2 group. But that's getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride or some other halide, and the reaction is a substitution. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, another reaction possibility: The presence of red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of an ylide, perhaps for Wittig reactions. But I don't see how that applies here, as the question is about the product, not the reagent.

Wait, going back to the NMR data. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, like a CH adjacent to an ester or ketone.

Wait, another approach: let's construct the structure of X based on NMR.

The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The substituents are likely a carboxylic acid group and another group, perhaps a side chain.

The side chain seems to have:

- A CH group (1H at 2.9 ppm)
- A CH2 group (2H at 1.7 ppm)
- A methyl group (3H at 1.4 ppm, d)
- An ethyl group (3H at 0.9 ppm, t)

So, the chain would be:

Ph–COOH (position 1) and Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2CH3 (position 4).

Wait, that would make the substituent a butyl group, perhaps a tertiary butyl group or something else.

Wait, the substituent would be Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)—. No, the substituent would be Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch.

Putting it all together:

The substituent could be a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. But that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That makes it a pentyl group but with a branch.

Wait, but that would give a longer chain, but the NMR doesn't seem to support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group where one of the CH2 groups is branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. That would be a four-carbon substituent? No, that's three carbons: CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which is a four-carbon substituent (the CH2 counts as one, the CH is another, and the CH2CH3 is three more). Wait, no, that's a sec-butyl group. Because the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which is a four-carbon group (but I think I'm getting confused here).

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to summarize.

Based on the IR and NMR data, X likely has a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent that's a chain with a branching point. The chain has a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH2 group (1.7 ppm), a methyl group (1.4 ppm), and an ethyl group (0.9 ppm). 

So, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group.

Thus, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). 

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which I thought was a Clemmensen reduction, but wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid doesn't have a ketone group. So, the reaction must be something else.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the reaction. Maybe the reaction is not a reduction but something else. For example, if X is an ester, the reaction could be hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

But in that case, the product would be the same as X, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotection. For example, if X is a benzoate ester, and the reaction removes the ester group, but that would lead to the same product as X.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce nitriles to amines. But if X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But the options don't show any amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that's done with different reagents like NaBH4 or LiAlH4.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol, but then the product would have an -OH group, which may not match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the oxidation of a ketone to a carboxylic acid, but oxidation usually requires different reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to an alkane, and that X is a ketone with a substituent that, upon reduction, becomes a CH2 group leading to one of the options.

Wait, let me think: if X is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone, then upon reduction, it becomes 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene.

But none of the options are ethylbenzene derivatives. Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone with a substituent that becomes a longer chain after reduction.

Wait, perhaps X has a benzene ring with a ketone and a substituent that's a chain with a ketone. Then, both ketones would be reduced.

Alternatively, maybe X is a cyclohexanone derivative, but that doesn't fit the aromatic NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ketone, like Ph-CO-R, where R is a chain leading to the ethyl group.

Upon reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, so the product would be Ph-CH2-R'.

Looking at the options, none directly match that, but perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

We think X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, such as option C.

But if X is option C, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would have to do something. Since option C is a carboxylic acid, and X is the starting material, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a coupling reaction, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the dehydration of X to form an alkene. But I don't see how red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester of the benzoic acid, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid. But then, the product would be the same as X, which doesn't make sense.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. I'll try to think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI — if X is a ketone, then the product would be an alkane. But if X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the acid part. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester of the benzoic acid, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate methyl ester. Then, upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI (acidic conditions), it would form the benzoic acid, which is option C. So, the product would be option C.

But then X would be the ester, which would have an OCH3 (if methyl) in the NMR, but the provided NMR doesn't show such a peak. So, that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the product after reduction is a carboxylic acid. But that doesn't make sense because reduction of a ketone would form an alkane, not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but again, the options don't show amines.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the removal of a carbonyl group, converting it into a methylene group. So, if X has a carbonyl group, the product would have a CH2 group.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So, perhaps X has a ketone group in the chain leading to the benzene. For example, X could be 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. Then, upon reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, making it 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a carbonyl group adjacent to a chain that, upon reduction, forms a carboxylic acid. But I don't see how that would happen.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should go with the initial thought that the correct answer is option C, based on the NMR data, but I'm not entirely sure about the reaction.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an -OH stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
1. **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
2. **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
3. **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet integrating to 1H, likely a methine (CH) group adjacent to a carbonyl.
4. **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet integrating to 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
5. **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
6. **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal ethyl group.

### Structural Interpretation:
- The para-substituted benzene ring suggests two substituents in the 1 and 4 positions.
- The 10.5 ppm peak confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.
- The substituent at position 4 is identified as a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)) based on the NMR data:
  - The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to the CH group in the sec-butyl chain.
  - The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
  - The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to the methyl group attached to the CH.
  - The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal ethyl group.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. However, since Compound X is a carboxylic acid, it is not directly reduced. Instead, the reaction likely leaves the carboxylic acid group intact, and no structural changes occur to the molecule. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituents and chain structure do not match the NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid group.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches both the IR and NMR data.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
