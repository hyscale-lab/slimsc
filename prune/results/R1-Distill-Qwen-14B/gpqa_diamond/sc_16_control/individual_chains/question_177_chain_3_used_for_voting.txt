Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step. So the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, the given information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies and compute the luminosity ratio.

Hmm. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Here, R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since 4πσ are constants, we can probably ignore them for the ratio.

Wait, but how does temperature come into play here? Oh right, the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2. But then why are the velocities different? Oh, the velocities are radial velocities, which are related to the Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength might be different due to Doppler effect, but the actual peak emission is determined by their rest frame temperatures.

Wait, no. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So when observed, their λ_max is the same. But if they have different velocities, their observed λ would be Doppler shifted. Hmm, so maybe we need to account for that.

Let me clarify. The actual (rest) temperature of each star would determine their emitted λ_max. But if one is moving towards or away from us, the observed λ_max changes. So the observed λ_max from both stars is the same, but their actual temperatures could be different. Wait, no, because in the problem, it's stated that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_observed is same for both. So their actual λ_rest would be different because of their velocities.

So, to find the actual temperatures, we need to correct for Doppler shift.

Wait, maybe. Let me think. When a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so the observed λ is shorter than the rest λ. Conversely, if moving away, λ is longer. But in this problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its λ_observed is the same as its λ_rest. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. I think radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). But the problem just gives the speeds, not the direction. Hmm. Wait, in the problem statement, it says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, perhaps. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm, I think the problem doesn't specify direction, just the magnitude. So perhaps it's moving away, which would cause a redshift.

So, for Star_2, its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max because it's moving away. But since both stars have the same observed λ_max, the actual T of each would be different.

Wait, no. Because the observed λ_max for both is the same. So let me imagine, Star_1 is at rest, so its λ_max is T1 = b / λ1. Star_2 is moving, so its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r) ) or something like that, depending on the approximation. Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is more precise. The relativistic Doppler shift is given by λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away. But for velocities much less than c, the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c) is used. But wait, if the source is moving away, v is positive, so λ_obs is longer. 

Alternatively, considering that for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift can be approximated as (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). So for Star_2, observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s. Since both stars have same observed λ_max, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But because Star_1 is at rest, λ1_obs = λ1_rest. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is proportional to 1/T. So: λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

But wait, wait, because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelengths are longer, so its λ_rest must be shorter (since λ_obs is longer). So if Star_2's λ_rest is shorter than Star_1's, that would mean T2 is higher, because λ_rest is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, perhaps I should write it more carefully.

Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since Star_1 is at rest)

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) (since moving away, so positive v.)

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs (given), so:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But,

λ1_rest = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Hmm, but v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c:

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c is ~3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.002333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767 * T2.

So T1 is approximately 0.99767 times T2.

Wait, that's a very small difference. Because 700 km/s is just a tiny fraction of c. So the temperature of Star_1 is slightly lower than Star_2?

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star_2 is moving away, so its λ_rest is shorter (since λ_obs is same as Star_1's λ_rest). So Star_2's rest λ is shorter, hence higher temperature. So T2 > T1.

Wait, let me verify that.

If a star is moving away, its observed λ is longer. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's rest λ is λ1, and Star_2's rest λ is λ2.

Then,

λ1 = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But since Star_1 is at rest, λ1 = λ1_rest. So,

λ1 = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

Thus,

λ2_rest = λ1 / (1 + v2/c)

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature.

So,

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ1 = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

Because T1 = b / λ1.

So,

T2 = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c).

Wait, this seems different from what I had earlier, so I must have confused the relationship earlier.

So, putting it all together:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So, T2 is higher. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1?

Wait, but then why? Because Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ is longer than the emitted λ. Wait, no. If Star_2 emits at a shorter wavelength (higher T), and then it's moving away, the observed λ would be longer, matching Star_1's λ.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose Star_2 is at rest, and T2 is higher than T1. Then λ2_rest is shorter than λ1_rest. So Star_2 emits at shorter wavelength.

But Star_2 is moving away. So its observed λ would be λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) = λ2_rest * 1.002333.

If that's equal to λ1_rest, which is longer, then λ2_rest would be λ1_rest / 1.002333, which is slightly shorter.

So T2 = b / λ2_rest = b * 1.002333 / λ1_rest = 1.002333 * T1.

So T2 is 1.002333 times T1.

So T2 ≈ 1.002333 * T1.

So now, we can compute the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π (R1)² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T2⁴

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

T2 = (1 + v2/c) * T1 ≈ 1.002333 T1.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)² * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * (1.002333 T1 )^4 )

Simplify:

= (2.25 R2² T1^4 ) / ( R2² * (1.002333)^4 T1^4 )

The R2^2 and T1^4 cancel out.

So,

= 2.25 / (1.002333)^4

Compute (1.002333)^4.

Let me approximate that. Since 1.002333 is close to 1, I can use the binomial expansion.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ...

x = 0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.002333)^3 + ... 

Compute each term:

First term: 1

Second term: 4*0.002333 ≈ 0.009332

Third term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * (5.44e-6) ≈ 3.264e-5

Fourth term: 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * (1.26e-8) ≈ 5.04e-8

Higher terms are negligible.

So summing:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Add third term: 1.009332 + 0.00003264 ≈ 1.009365.

Fourth term adds 0.0000000504, which is negligible.

So approximately 1.009365.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.009365.

1.009365 is roughly 1.009365.

So, 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ Let me compute this.

Let me compute 1 / 1.009365 ≈ approximately 0.9907.

Because 1.009365 * 0.9907 ≈ 1.0000.

So,

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275.

But wait, more accurately, since 1 / 1.009365 is about 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.247675

Adding together: 1.9814 + 0.247675 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because the approximate (1.002333)^4 might be a bit off.

Alternatively, let me compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.002333^2 first.

(1.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Then, square that result to get the fourth power.

(1.00467144)^2 = ?

So,

(1.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182.

= 1.0093647.

So (1.002333)^4 = 1.0093647.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.0093647.

Compute this division:

1.0093647 * 2.23 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute with approximation.

Alternatively, compute 2.25 / 1.0093647.

We can write this as 2.25 * (1 / 1.0093647) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067.

Because 1/1.0093647 is approximately 0.99067.

So 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.00933) ≈ 2.25 - 0.02103 = 2.22897.

So about 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but I thought the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So L1/L2 is ~2.23?

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: Let's re-express the Doppler shift formula correctly.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But this is the exact formula for when the source is moving away (v positive).

Wait no, the formula can be written as λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) ) when the source is moving away.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get the correct Doppler shift formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) ) when the source is moving away.

Since f is inversely proportional to λ, we can write:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

So for small v (v << c), it can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/(2c)).

Wait, so in the earlier approach, I might have used the wrong approximation.

Let me re-calculate.

Given that, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

But for small v, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/(2c)).

Wait, let me compute the exact factor for v =700 km/s.

v =7e5 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333,

(1 - v/c) = 0.997667.

So,

sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) ) = sqrt( 1.004672 ) ≈ 1.00233.

Thus,

λ_obs = λ_rest * 1.00233.

So, the same as the approximate formula. So earlier calculation holds.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.00233.

Then,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.00233.

Thus,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / 1.00233.

Using Wien's law, λ = b / T.

So,

λ2_rest = b/(T2) → T2 = b/(λ2_rest).

Similarly, T1 = b/(λ1_rest).

So,

T2 = b/( (λ1_rest / 1.00233) ) = (1.00233) * (b/λ1_rest ) = 1.00233 * T1.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

Thus, temperatures are T2 is slightly higher.

So, going back to luminosity.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

Given R1 = 1.5 R2,

T2= 1.00233 T1.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (1.00233 T1)^4 )

Simplify:

= (2.25 R2² T1^4) / ( R2² (1.00233)^4 T1^4 )

Cancel R2² and T1^4:

= 2.25 / (1.00233)^4.

Earlier, we computed (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So,

2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.228 ≈ 2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity of a star is proportional to \( L \propto R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radii**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Peak Wavelengths**: Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \), implying that their rest wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) are related by the Doppler effect due to Star_2's radial velocity.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 (at rest), while Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (moving away).

### Step 1: Relating Rest Wavelengths and Temperatures
Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \). The observed wavelength for Star_2 is Doppler-shifted, so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For small \( v \), this can be approximated as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v}{2c}\right)
\]

Since both stars have the same observed wavelength, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \), we equate their rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{2c}\right)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \), we find:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{2c}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_2}{2c} = \frac{7 \times 10^5}{2 \cdot 3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.001167
\]

So:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.001167
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = 1.001167 T_1 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 (1.001167 T_1)^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{(1.001167)^4}
\]

### Step 4: Approximating \( (1.001167)^4 \)
Using the binomial expansion for small \( x \), \( (1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^2 \), where \( x = 0.001167 \) and \( n = 4 \):

\[
(1.001167)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.001167) + \frac{4(3)}{2}(0.001167)^2
\]

\[
(1.001167)^4 \approx 1 + 0.004668 + 0.0000086 \approx 1.004677
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.004677} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
