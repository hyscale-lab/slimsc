Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. 

So, Mike is using a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to make an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr, which is really low pressure. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible to improve the electron microscopy because gas molecules can scatter the electrons, right? 

But despite the vacuum pumps, some gas particles are still in the compartment. The mass spectrometer detects them, so Mike knows they're there. He calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2, but the temperature is the same. So what's causing this change? 

Wait, the mean free path in a gas is given by the formula λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and p is the pressure. Or wait, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p). But in any case, the mean free path depends on pressure and temperature. 

In a vacuum, when the pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer because molecules don't collide as often. So higher pressure (more molecules) would lead to shorter mean free paths. 

But when Mike turns on the electron beam, what's happening? Oh, right! The electron beam is a source of energy. It might be heating up the gas molecules or causing some sort of interaction. Wait, but the problem states that the temperature remains the same. So if temperature doesn't change, why would the mean free path change?

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam could be imparting a charge on the gas molecules. Or maybe the gas is being ionized by the beam. Oh, right! When electrons hit the gas molecules, they can cause ionization. So the gas molecules might become charged, which could affect their behavior in the vacuum.

If the gas molecules are ionized, their mean free path could change. How? Well, let's think about it. In a vacuum with charged particles, the mean free path can be affected by other forces like electric fields or by the fact that charged particles might stick to the walls or other surfaces more. But wait, the electron beam is a high-energy beam, so maybe it's creating a plasma or some sort of charged environment.

Alternatively, when the gas molecules are ionized, they might have a different effective diameter for scattering purposes. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to be more or less dense in a certain area, which would change the pressure locally.

Wait, the problem says the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. So thermal considerations like molecular speed (which depends on temperature) shouldn't change. 

Wait, another thought: if the gas is ionized, the mean free path calculation might change. Because the ionized particles could interact with the electric fields in the electron microscope, which would affect their paths. But wait, the mean free path formula in the gas phase is about collisions between gas molecules. If the gas is ionized and starts interacting with the charged particles (like the electron beam), then perhaps the dominant scattering mechanism changes.

Wait, the mean free path is about the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. So if the gas is ionized, perhaps the collisions between gas ions and electrons or other ions in the beam are more frequent? Or maybe the charged gas ions are more likely to stick to the walls of the vacuum chamber, which could effectively reduce the number of gas molecules in the compartment.

Oh! If the gas molecules are being ionized and then getting attracted to the walls (which might be charged or have a potential due to the electron beam), they might be removed from the system. So the effective pressure in the sample compartment would decrease because some of the gas is being pumped out or stuck to the walls. 

Wait, but initially, the pressure was already at ultra-high vacuum, but some gas remained. When Mike starts the electron beam, perhaps more gas molecules are being removed because they're ionized and can be extracted or pumped away more efficiently. Or the gas molecules might be getting stuck to the walls more, thus reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment. 

If the number of gas molecules decreases, the pressure would decrease. Since the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure (λ ∝ 1/p), a lower pressure would lead to a longer mean free path. Wait, but in the problem, when Mike starts the beam, he observes that the mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. If the pressure has decreased, λ2 would be larger than λ1. But wait, the question says that originally, λ1 is the mean free path under vacuum. Then when the beam is on, λ2 is the new mean free path.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the vacuum is better (lower pressure), the mean free path should be longer. So if λ2 is longer than λ1, that would mean the pressure is lower, so λ2 > λ1. But let's look at the options.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
B) λ2 = λ1, discrepancy
C) λ2 < λ1
D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Wait, so option C says λ2 is smaller than λ1, which would mean the mean free path got shorter. That would imply higher pressure, but why would that happen if the beam is causing the gas to be removed?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Let me think again. So initially, the gas is present, and the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is turned on, it causes more scattering, either by increasing the effective collisions or changing the dynamics. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to move or to interact in such a way that their effective mean free path changes.

Wait, another thought. The electron beam can cause the gas to heat up. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same. Alternatively, perhaps the gas molecules are being accelerated by the electric field of the electron beam, which would increase their velocity. But if temperature is the same, that can't be because temperature relates to the average kinetic energy.

Wait, the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p). So if pressure p decreases (because the gas is being pumped out more effectively), λ increases. So if λ2 is greater than λ1, then λ2 > λ1. But in the problem, Mike finds that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but λ2. So, the question is, is λ2 longer or shorter than λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is determined by electron scattering, not gas collisions. Wait, the question says that upon initiating the electron beam, he observes that the mean free path (I think he's measuring based on electron scattering now) is λ2. So perhaps the initial λ1 was calculated without considering the electron beam, but when the beam is on, the effective scattering changes.

Wait, the mean free path for electrons would be different from the mean free path for gas molecules. Oh wait, the question says Mike accurately determined the mean free path of the gas molecules to be λ1. But then when the electron beam is on, he's observing the mean free path of the gas molecules in a different way. Or perhaps he's looking at the electron scattering, which is influenced by the gas molecules' presence.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized, and the ionized particles are deflected or scattered more by the beam's electric fields. So the effective cross-section for scattering might change. If the scattering is more efficient, the mean free path for the electrons would be shorter. But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is present, the gas molecules are ionized, and the charged particles experience different forces. For example, if the vacuum chamber has an electric field (which it probably does, given the electron beam), the ionized gas molecules might be accelerated towards the walls, effectively reducing their number in the sample compartment. This would decrease the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, the problem states that the temperature is the same. So the initial calculation of λ1 was based on the pressure, temperature, and volume. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the pressure effectively decreases because gas is being removed more (stuck to the walls), so the pressure is lower. Therefore, λ2 would be longer than λ1. But the options suggest that λ2 is less than λ1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile or to collide more frequently. But why would that be? If the gas is ionized, perhaps the ionized molecules have a higher effective cross-section for collisions. So if the cross-section is larger (d increases in the mean free path formula), λ decreases.

Wait, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter (d^2) of the molecules. So if the gas molecules, upon ionization, have a larger effective diameter (maybe because they're charged and attract each other more), the mean free path λ would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

But that seems a bit abstract. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to stick to the walls more, which effectively reduces the number of gas particles in the compartment, thereby lowering the pressure and increasing the mean free path.

Wait, but Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So which way does it go? If the pressure decreases, λ increases, so λ2 would be higher than λ1. But the options don't have a choice where λ2 is higher. Let's look again.

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → λ2 is larger.

B) λ2 = λ1 → same.

C) λ2 < λ1 → smaller.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 → λ2 is a bit larger.

So if the pressure is lower, λ2 is larger. So the correct λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the options A, D suggest that. But what's the reasoning?

Wait, but in the problem statement, Mike's observation is that the mean free path is λ2, not λ1. So why would it change?

Oh wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more mobile or to have a higher rate of collisions due to some other effect. Alternatively, the mean free path Mike measures is for the electrons, not the gas molecules. No, the question says Mike determined the mean free path of the gas.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation (λ1) was without considering the electron beam's influence on gas molecules, but when the beam is on, it might cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other or with the walls, thereby changing the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas is λ1. When the beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure is higher because more gas is in the compartment due to the beam somehow causing gas to be released or something. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the beam causes the gas to heat, but the temperature is the same. Hmm. Another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may become excited and increase in number due to some process (like desorption), but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be ionized, and the ionized gas molecules have a different mean free path because they interact more with the vacuum chamber walls. For example, if the ionized molecules stick to the walls more, the effective pressure decreases. So the mean free path would increase.

If the pressure decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So which option fits that?

Looking at the options, A says λ2 is >= 1.22*λ1. D says λ2 is in between λ1 and 1.22*λ1. So if the pressure drops enough, λ2 could be significantly larger.

Wait, but why would the presence of the electron beam lower the pressure? Because the beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to be pumped out or stick to the walls. For instance, in an ultra-high vacuum system, charged particles (like ions) can be more effectively pumped by the vacuum pumps, perhaps.

Alternatively, the electron beam might cause the gas to be ionized, and these ions could be captured by the vacuum pump's ion getter, effectively removing them from the system. So the number of gas particles in the compartment decreases, leading to lower pressure. Lower pressure → longer mean free path. So λ2 would be longer than λ1.

Therefore, λ2 is larger than λ1, so the correct option would be A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 or D) λ2 in between.

Wait, but how much does the pressure change? The initial pressure is already ultra-high, like 1e-9 Torr. So any small change could significantly affect the mean free path.

Hmm, but the mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n * π * d^2), where n is the number density. So if n decreases, λ increases. So even a small change in n could lead to a larger λ.

Wait, but the problem says that the pressure remained the same because the temperature is the same? No, the temperature is same, but the pressure might change due to other factors.

Wait no, the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So pressure is related to n via the ideal gas law: p = nRT/V. So if T and V are constant, and n decreases, p decreases. So if the pressure decreases, λ increases.

So the mean free path would increase. Therefore, λ2 > λ1. So the options that have λ2 larger are A and D.

But why would the pressure decrease? Because the electron beam is causing gas to be pumped out more, perhaps. So the mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be larger.

The original mean free path was calculated based on the pressure before the beam was on. If the beam operation reduces the pressure, the mean free path would be longer.

So which option to choose? The options are:

C) λ2 < λ1 → no, because pressure is lower, so λ should increase.

So the correct answer should be either A or D. But the question says Mike's observation upon initiating the electron beam is that the mean free path is now λ2, but the temperature is same.

Wait, but the mean free path in the presence of the electron beam might be influenced by the electron scattering. The initial mean free path λ1 was determined without considering the electron beam. But when the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to be hit by the electrons, causing more collisions, which would effectively reduce the mean free path.

Wait, no, because the mean free path of the gas molecules is about how often they collide with each other, not with the electrons. So the presence of the electron beam might not affect the gas's own mean free path.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The mean free path of the gas (λ) is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The presence of the electron beam shouldn't directly affect that unless the beam's presence causes the gas to ionize or change in some way that affects the gas's own collisions.

If the gas is ionized, perhaps the ionized molecules have a different mean free path. For example, if the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, the effective pressure (n) would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path.

Alternatively, if the ionized gas molecules are more likely to collide with the electron beam, but that's about electron-gas interactions, not gas-gas collisions.

So overall, I think the presence of the electron beam would cause the gas to ionize, which may lead to the gas being more effectively pumped out or stuck to the walls. This would decrease the number of gas molecules (n), leading to a lower pressure, which in turn increases the mean free path λ. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >=1.22λ1, and D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1. So which one is it?

Wait, the exact change depends on how much the pressure drops. If the pressure drops significantly, λ could be much larger. But considering the initial pressure was already very low (1e-9 Torr), even a small change could cause λ to increase by a certain factor.

Wait, perhaps the pressure isn't changing much, but the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor into the equation. Let me think about the mean free path formula again.

Another approach: the mean free path for electrons in the presence of gas molecules is different. But the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more energetic, but since the temperature is the same, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the beam induces some other effect, like dissociation of gas molecules, which would change their effective diameter d.

If the gas molecules dissociate into smaller fragments, d decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to d squared, λ would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But without knowing the exact change, it's hard to say whether it's more than 1.22 times.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ionized gas has a different mean free path. For example, if the ionized gas has a lower effective cross-section (maybe because they're moving faster or something else), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another factor: in the presence of an electric field (from the electron beam), the ionized gas molecules might experience a force, which could cause them to move more towards the walls, effectively reducing the number in the compartment. So again, pressure decreases, λ increases.

So in all these scenarios, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct answer should be either A or D.

But the question is asking what can be concluded about λ2. So the possibilities are that λ2 is longer.

Looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >=1.22*λ1 → possible.

Option D: λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1 → also possible.

Which is more likely? Without exact numbers, it's hard to say. But perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't cause a huge drop in pressure, so λ2 would be just a bit larger than λ1. Or maybe the effect is significant enough to make λ2 at least 1.22 times. 

Wait, where does the 1.22 factor come from? 1.22 is approximately the factor for the mean free path considering the effective diameter of the molecules when accounting for the collision integral or something similar. Or wait, maybe it's related to the factor in the mean free path formula when considering the actual collision diameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path in the presence of the electron beam includes another factor, but I'm not certain.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what the question is really asking. It's a high-vacuum scenario, and the electron beam's presence affects the mean free path. So why would the mean free path change?

Another possibility is that the electron beam causes the gas to heat, but the temperature is the same, so that can't be it. Alternatively, the beam causes the gas to ionize, which might lead to a change in the effective number of particles (due to different pumping rates for ions vs. neutral gas), thus changing the pressure.

If the ionized gas is more effectively pumped away by the vacuum system, the pressure would drop, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 is longer than λ1.

So given that, the answer is either A or D. But without knowing the exact change, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1. Because the presence of the beam might cause more collisions between gas molecules and the electrons, which would mean the gas molecules are more likely to be scattered, but wait, that affects the electron's mean free path, not the gas's.

Wait, the question is about the gas's mean free path. So if the pressure drops, λ increases.

So conclusion: λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, only A and D fit this, so the correct answer is either A or D.

But why would the mean free path either be larger than λ1 or just a little larger?

Well, the mean free path depends on the inverse of pressure. So if the pressure decreases, λ increases. The question is, how much does the pressure drop when the electron beam is turned on?

In a high-vacuum system, the presence of an electron beam can cause some gas to be ionized, and ionized gas can be more effectively pumped out, leading to a significant drop in pressure. So the mean free path could increase by a factor greater than 1.22.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile, leading to a higher collision rate, which would decrease the mean free path. But that would imply λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Higher collision rate would mean shorter mean free path, yes. But why would the collision rate increase when the pressure is lower?

If the pressure is lower, the gas is less dense, so fewer collisions, longer mean free path. So higher collision rate would require higher pressure, which would lower λ. But why would the collision rate increase when the electron beam is on?

Maybe because the electron beam provides energy to the gas, causing the gas to heat, but the temperature is the same. Hmm. Or perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to become more ionized, which could change the effective cross-section for collisions.

If ionized gas molecules have a larger effective diameter (maybe due to charge interactions), then the mean free path would decrease, making λ2 < λ1. So in that case, option C would be correct.

But this reasoning is getting a bit speculative. Let me think of another angle. The mean free path is given by λ = 1/(√2 π d^2 n), where n is the number density. So if the number density n decreases, λ increases. If the number density increases, λ decreases.

But in the presence of the electron beam, perhaps the number density of gas in the compartment decreases because the ionized gas is being pumped away more efficiently. So n decreases, λ increases.

So lambda2 is larger than lambda1.

Thus, the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, but the problem says that when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. So compared to lambda1, which was calculated without the beam, lambda2 could be longer or shorter.

If the beam causes the gas to be pumped out more, lambda2 is longer. So perhaps the correct answer is A or D.

But looking back at the options, I don't see any option that says lambda2 is definitely longer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to collide with the beam electrons, which would effectively increase their rate of loss (i.e., being removed from the compartment), thus decreasing the number of gas molecules, which lowers the pressure, and increases the mean free path.

So in that case, the mean free path would be longer. So lambda2 is longer than lambda1.

So the options would be A or D.

But the question is, why is the mean free path now λ2 and not λ1? Because the condition has changed. So if the pressure is lower, then lambda2 is higher. So the answer is either A or D.

But the question is, which one is the case? Without knowing the exact change, perhaps the problem points towards a decrease.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls, which effectively lowers the mean free path. Because more molecules are colliding with the walls, so they don't travel as far on average. But if the pressure is lower, the mean free path should be longer. Hmm, conflicting ideas.

Wait, if the gas is ionized, they may stick to the walls more, which would remove them from the compartment, leading to lower pressure, higher mean free path. So lambda2 > lambda1.

So the correct answer would require lambda2 to be larger than lambda1. So options A or D.

But the problem doesn't specify the exact factor. So perhaps the correct answer is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1, so the only options are A and D.

But let me think about why the answer isn't C. If the presence of the beam somehow caused gas to be more dense, which would make lambda smaller. But that scenario doesn't make sense because the vacuum is already ultra-high. The beam would probably reduce the density, not increase it.

Therefore, the mean free path should increase, so lambda2 > lambda1.

Looking at the options, the only ones that fit are A and D. So which one is correct?

The question states that Mike found the mean free path was no longer lambda1. So why would it change?

If the gas is ionized, perhaps the mean free path is calculated differently. For example, when considering ion-molecule interactions, perhaps the effective diameter d increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, ionized gas molecules have a larger effective diameter due to their charge, which would increase their cross-sectional area. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to d squared, a larger d would decrease the mean free path. So in that case, lambda2 would be less than lambda1, making option C the correct answer.

Ah, this makes sense! If the gas is ionized, the effective diameter d for collision increases because the ions have a larger effective size due to their charge. So the mean free path λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d² p). If d increases, λ decreases, so lambda2 < lambda1.

So in this scenario, the mean free path becomes shorter because the effective diameter is larger. So the correct answer is option C) λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 1000 kV, Mike aimed to create an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr) to minimize gas molecule scattering of the electron beam. Despite the vacuum pumps, some gas molecules remained, and Mike determined the mean free path of these molecules as λ1. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained constant.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 p}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(p\) is the pressure. The mean free path depends on the pressure, temperature, and the effective diameter of the gas molecules.

When the electron beam is turned on, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules have an effective diameter (\(d\)) that increases due to their charge, which enhances their interaction with each other. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to \(d^2\), an increase in the effective diameter results in a shorter mean free path. Additionally, the electron beam may influence the gas dynamics, potentially altering the effective pressure or molecular interactions, but the key factor here is the increased effective diameter of the ionized gas molecules.

Given that the temperature remains constant, the primary reason for the change in the mean free path is the increase in the effective diameter of the gas molecules due to ionization. This leads to a decrease in the mean free path, making λ2 smaller than λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
