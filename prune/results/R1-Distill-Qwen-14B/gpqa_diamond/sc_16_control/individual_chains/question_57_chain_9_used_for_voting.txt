Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering, right. I remember that scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts in partial waves.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we’re told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So probably I don't need to consider higher order terms beyond δ₄.

Wait, the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term involving the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. But I might be mixing things up.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude f in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (l - iδ_l) e^{iδ_l} - (l + iδ_l) e^{-iδ_l} ) * (2l + 1) ) * P_l(cosθ) ], where k is the wave number, i is the imaginary unit, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking about the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. That would be θ=0°, because the incident beam is the initial direction, and the scattering angle is measured from that direction. So when θ=0, cosθ=1. Therefore, each term in the sum will involve P_l(1), which is 1 for all l, since P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So the amplitude simplifies a lot because all the Legendre polynomials at θ=0 are 1. So we can ignore the P_l terms in this case.

Now, the imaginary part of the amplitude f. Let me write f as f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} [ ( (l - iδ_l) e^{iδ_l} - (l +iδ_l) e^{-iδ_l} ) * (2l+1) ].

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I recall that the scattering amplitude can be written as (1/(2ik)) times a sum over l of (something with δ_l and some exponential terms). Let me think again.

Oh, right! The general expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{iδ_l} ( sin(δ_l + (l - (l+1)iδ_l )) ? No, perhaps another approach. Alternatively, I think the expression simplifies when considering the real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the sum of the phase shifts weighted by some terms. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find the imaginary part of f.

Each term in the sum for f is [ (l - i δ_l) e^{i δ_l} - (l + i δ_l) e^{-i δ_l} ] * (2l+1) 

Let me compute that term. Let me factor it out:

(l - i δ_l) e^{i δ_l} = l e^{i δ_l} - i δ_l e^{i δ_l}

Similarly, (l + i δ_l) e^{-i δ_l} = l e^{-i δ_l} + i δ_l e^{-i δ_l}

So the entire term is [ l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ} - l e^{-i δ} - i δ e^{-i δ} ] 

= l (e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ}) ) - i δ (e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ})

Now, we can compute this:

e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ} = 2i sin δ

e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ} = 2 cos δ

So substituting back:

= l*(2i sin δ) - i δ*(2 cos δ)

= 2i l sin δ - 2 i δ cos δ

So the entire term is [2i l sin δ - 2 i δ cos δ ] * (2l+1)

Wait, but wait, the term is multiplied by (2l+1), so the entire contribution for each l is (2l+1)*[2i l sin δ - 2i δ cos δ ].

Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck the expansion:

Original term inside the square brackets is [ (l -i δ) e^{i δ} - (l +i δ) e^{-i δ} ]

Which is equal to (l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ}) ) - ( l e^{-i δ} + i δ e^{-i δ} )

= l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ} - l e^{-i δ} - i δ e^{-i δ}

Grouping terms:

= l (e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ}) ) - i δ (e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ} )

Which is correct.

So substituting into the terms:

= l * 2i sin δ - i δ * 2 cos δ

So the whole term is (2i l sin δ - 2 i δ cos δ ) * (2l +1 )

Wait, wait, no. Because the term is (2i l sin δ - 2i δ cos δ ), and then multiplied by (2l+1). So:

Each l contributes (2l+1) * [2i l sin δ - 2i δ cos δ ]

So when I factor out 2i, it's 2i (2l+1) [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ]

Now, putting this into f(θ=0):

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} [ 2i (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

Simplify:

The 2i and 1/(2ik) will multiply to give (2i)/(2ik) = 1/k.

So f(θ=0) = [ sum_{l} (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ] * (1/k)

But wait, wait. Let me compute that step again:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ 2i (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) ) * 2i sum [ (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

The 2i and 1/(2ik) would give (2i)/(2ik) = 1/k.

So f = [ sum (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ] * (1/k) 

Wait, no, because 2i/(2ik) = 1/(k) (because 2i cancels as 2i/2i =1, leaving 1/k).

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

The overall expression is:

(1/(2ik)) * [ sum_{l} (2i (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ )) ]

So,

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i * sum [ (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

The 2i and 1/(2ik) multiply:

(2i) / (2ik) ) = (1/k) * (i/i) )? Wait, 2i/(2ik) = 1/k.

Wait, 2i divided by 2ik is (2i)/(2ik) ) = 1/k.

So f = (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

So the imaginary part of f would be the imaginary part of this expression. But wait, k is a real number, right? Because k is the wave number, which is sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

So 1/k is real. So the imaginary part of f is equal to the imaginary part of the sum.

But the sum is (sum [ (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]) * (1/k )

Wait, but looking at the term inside the sum: (2l+1) times ( l sin δ - δ cos δ )

Each term is a real number because l, δ, sin and cos are real. So the sum is real. Therefore, the entire expression is real, meaning that the imaginary part is zero. Wait, that can’t be right. Because the options don't have zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me think again. Maybe I should have considered the real and imaginary parts more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the initial expansion is incorrect. Let me try another approach.

I remember that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is related to the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by certain factors.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l + 1) sin(2 δ_l) ) ), because when θ=0, the amplitude has terms involving sin(2 δ_l) in the imaginary part.

Wait, I think I might have confused the expressions. Let me recall the formula.

In general, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} (l - i δ_l) - (l + i δ_l) ]

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the expansion of f in terms of the partial waves.

The scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l ( (2l +1) (l - |m|) )^{-1/2} [ (e^{iδ_l} ( l + iδ_l ) - e^{-iδ_l} ( l - iδ_l ) ) / ( 2i ) ] e^{i m φ} P_l^m (cosθ)

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for the direction along the incident beam (θ=0), the azimuthal angle φ is zero, so the sum over m simplifies.

Wait, but when θ=0, and the scattering is along the beam, the m=0 term would dominate because P_l^m(1) is zero for m≠0. So perhaps it's easier to consider m=0.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. From memory, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) ). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach: Since at θ=0, the amplitude f is real? Or is it? No, I think f can have both real and imaginary parts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) to the total cross-section. But the optical theorem says that the imaginary part of f(0) is related to sigma_total.

Wait, the optical theorem states that (4π/k) Im f(0) = sigma_total.

But I don't have sigma_total here. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the imaginary part by considering each term's imaginary part.

Wait, let's go back to the expression for f(θ=0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} [ ( e^{i δ_l} (l - i δ_l ) - e^{-i δ_l} ( l + i δ_l ) ) (2l +1) ]

Let me write each term in the sum as:

Term_l = (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} ( l - i δ_l ) - e^{-i δ_l} ( l + i δ_l ) ]

Let me compute this term:

Term_l = (2l +1) [ l (e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l}) ) - i δ_l (e^{i δ_l} + e^{-i δ_l}) ) ]

Again, e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ} = 2i sin δ, and e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ} = 2 cos δ.

So,

Term_l = (2l +1) [ l (2i sin δ) - i δ (2 cos δ) ]

= (2l +1) * 2i [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ]

So,

Term_l = 2i (2l +1) [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ]

So, putting into f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ 2i (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ ... ]

The 2i and 1/(2ik) multiply to give (2i)/(2ik) = 1/k.

So,

f(0) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

Wait, but this is a real expression. So the imaginary part would be zero? That can't be right because the options don't have zero, and from the given phase shifts, I would expect an imaginary part.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see: maybe I should have considered that the term ( l - i δ ) e^{i δ} is complex, and similarly for the other part.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of each term. Let's consider each term in the sum: 

Term_l = (2l +1) [ (l - i δ) e^{i δ} - (l + i δ) e^{-i δ} ]

Let me compute each part:

(l -i δ) e^{i δ} = l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ} 

Similarly, (l +i δ) e^{-i δ} = l e^{-i δ} + i δ e^{-i δ}

So,

Term_l = (2l +1) [ l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ} - l e^{-i δ} - i δ e^{-i δ} ]

= (2l+1) [ l (e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ}) - i δ (e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ}) ]

As before, e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ} = 2i sin δ,

e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ} = 2 cos δ.

So,

Term_l = (2l+1) [ l * 2i sin δ - i δ * 2 cos δ ]

= (2l+1) [ 2i l sin δ - 2i δ cos δ ]

= 2i (2l+1) [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ]

So, that's what I had before. Now, putting into f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ 2i (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ ... ]

= (1/k) sum [ (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

So, f(0) is real. Therefore, the imaginary part is zero. But the options don't include zero. So I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Maybe I should have considered the imaginary part from the exponential terms in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f is given by the sum of the terms involving sin( δ_l ), considering that each phase shift contributes to the imaginary part.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l +1) [ ( e^{2iδ_l} (l - i δ_l ) - (l + i δ_l ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to write it. Wait, this might be the correct expression.

So, f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l +1) [ (l -i δ_l) e^{i δ_l} - (l +i δ_l) e^{-i δ_l} ]

Yes, that's correct.

Now, expanding each term:

( l -i δ ) e^{i δ} = l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ}

Similarly, ( l +i δ ) e^{-i δ} = l e^{-i δ} +i δ e^{-i δ}

So,

[ (l -i δ) e^{i δ} - (l +i δ) e^{-i δ} ] = l e^{i δ} -i δ e^{i δ} - l e^{-i δ} -i δ e^{-i δ}

= l (e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ}) -i δ (e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ})

= l * 2i sin δ -i δ * 2 cos δ

= 2i l sin δ - 2i δ cos δ 

Factor out 2i:

= 2i ( l sin δ - δ cos δ )

So,

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l +1) [ 2i ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ )

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i * sum [ ... ]

The 2i and 1/(2ik) multiply to give (2i)/(2ik) ) = 1/k.

So, f = sum [ (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ] / k 

So, f is real, so the imaginary part is zero. But that can't be correct because the problem is asking for the imaginary part.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part of f is not zero. Let me think about this again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking back, the phase shifts are given as δ_o, δ_1, etc. So, for each l, δ_l is given. So for l=0, δ is 90°, l=1, 67°, etc.

Wait, but when l=0, what happens? Let's compute the term for l=0:

Term_l0 = (2*0 +1) [ 0 sin δ_0 - δ_0 cos δ_0 ]

= 1 [ 0 - δ_0 cos δ_0 ]

= - δ_0 cos δ_0 

Similarly, for l=0, the term is - δ_0 cos δ_0.

Wait, but in our expression, f(0) is the sum over l multiplied by 1/k. So the sum is the sum of terms (2l+1)( l sin δ_l - δ_l cos δ_l )

So, for each l:

Term_l = (2l+1) ( l sin δ_l - δ_l cos δ_l )

So, let's compute each Term_l for l=0 to 4, then sum them all, multiply by 1/k, and then take the imaginary part.

Wait, but wait, the expression for f is real, so the imaginary part is zero. But the options don't include zero, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the real part only, but the initial expression for f includes the exponential terms which could contribute to the imaginary part. Wait, but in our calculation, f came out real.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Wait, I think I've read somewhere that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

If that's the case, then perhaps I can compute that.

So, let me compute each term in the sum: (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

We'll compute for l=0 to l=4, as higher l's are ignored.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → sin(180°)=0. So term is (1) * 0 → 0.

l=1: δ=67° → 2δ=134° → sin(134) ≈ sin(180-46)=sin(46) ≈ 0.7193 → (2*1 +1)=3 → 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: δ=55° → 2δ=110° → sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 → (2*2+1)=5 → 5 *0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: δ=30° → 2δ=60° → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660 → (2*3+1)=7 → 7 * 0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13° → 2δ=26° → sin(26)≈0.4384 → (2*4+1)=9 → 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0

l=1: 2.1579

l=2:4.6985 → sum after l=2: 6.8564

l=3:6.062 → sum: 12.9184

l=4:3.9456 → sum: 16.864.

So sum = 0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 ≈16.864.

Now, the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) * sum. So Im f = (1/(2k)) * 16.864.

But we need to compute k, the wave number. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. So I need to compute k for 50 MeV electrons.

The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), where m is the mass of the electron.

But, let me compute it properly. The formula is:

k = sqrt( (2 m_e E) ) / ħ 

But E is in the same units as ħ and m_e. Let me use natural units for a moment. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it using the relativistic formula.

Wait, 50 MeV is a relativistic energy for electrons. So the electron's energy E is much larger than its rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV). So I can approximate the electron's momentum as E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/c, then k = p/ħ.

Wait, but let's compute it correctly.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

For E much greater than m c^2, we can approximate E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/(c)

So, p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV s.

Wait, perhaps better to use units where ħ c is known. Let's compute k:

k = p / ħ = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/( ħ c )

Because E is in MeV, and ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = E/(ħ c ) → E=50 MeV.

k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So, 2k ≈ 0.506 fm^-1.

Now, Im f = (1/(2k)) * sum → sum is 16.864.

So,

Im f = (16.864) / (2k) ) = 16.864 / (2 * 0.253) ) ≈ 16.864 / 0.506 ≈ 33.32 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 33.32 fm.

The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B) 355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that I used the formula Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

But wait, the units might be off. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, let me compute k accurately.

E=50 MeV.

The electron mass m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV.

So, E=50 MeV is much larger than m_e c^2, so the approximation E ≈ pc is valid.

p= E/(c) → but in units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, the momentum p is E/(c) = 50 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ → but p = E/(c), so k = E/( ħ c )

Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm,

k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50 / 197.33 → ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So 2k ≈ 0.506 fm^-1.

Sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) is approx 16.864.

Im f = sum/(2k) → 16.864/(0.506) ≈33.32 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, going back, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction (θ=0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, but wait, perhaps the actual formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) ) × (1/(2k)).

So, let me compute that sum again.

But wait, when l=0, δ=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0 → term is 0.

l=1: 2δ=134°, sin(134)=0.7193 → term is 3 * 0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:2δ=110°, sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:2δ=60°, sin=0.8660 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:2δ=26°, sin≈0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

So, sum is 16.864.

Im f = (sum)/(2k) ) = 16.864/(2 *0.253) = 16.864/(0.506) ≈33.32 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is given by (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula should be Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

Wait, but that's what I did, and it gives 33.32 fm, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken into account the factor of 2 from the sin(2δ) term. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Which is what I used. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Let me recompute the sum for each l:

l=0, δ=90°: 2δ=180°, sin=0 → term 0.

l=1, δ=67°: 2δ=134°, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193 → term 3 * 0.7193 =2.1579.

l=2, δ=55°: 2δ=110°, sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3, δ=30°: 2δ=60°, sin=0.8660 →7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4, δ=13°: 2δ=26°, sin≈0.4384 →9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Adding them up: 0 +2.1579=2.1579; +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

So, Im f = 16.864 / (2k) ) → k=50/(197.33)=0.253 fm^-1.

2k=0.506.

16.864 / 0.506 ≈33.32 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe I should think about what the question is asking again. It says, "calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction."

Wait, another possibility: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) ) )

Wait, but let me calculate that.

Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: (1) sin(90)=1 → term=1.

l=1:3 sin67 → sin67≈0.9205 → 3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 sin55 → sin55≈0.8192 →5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 sin30 → sin30=0.5 →7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin13 → sin13≈0.2249 →9*0.2249≈2.024.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.024=13.3815.

So sum is approximately 13.3815.

Im f = sum/(2k) → 13.3815/(2*0.253) )=13.3815/0.506≈26.45 fm.

This is closer to option D, which is 251.271 fm. But 26.45 is not close to any of the options.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10^3 or something because of units. Let me recheck the calculation of k.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, E=50 MeV.

k = E/(ħ c) → 50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

But wait, perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse meters, because the options are in femtometers (fm). Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l )

Which gives us approximately 33.32 fm. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options have a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the phase shifts in terms of the partial wave expansion, and then compute the imaginary part.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f can be written as:

f = sum_{l} ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(k) ) [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part comes from the sin δ terms multiplied by Legendre polynomials. But at θ=0, Legendre polynomials are 1, so the sum is over (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, no, perhaps the imaginary part of f is (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Wait, that would give Im f = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) /k.

So, let me compute that sum:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 → 1.

l=1:3 sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin13≈9*0.2249≈2.024.

Sum: 1 + 2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.024=13.3815.

So sum is 13.3815.

k=50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Im f = 13.3815 /0.253 ≈52.84 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), which gives 33.32 fm. Still not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are summed with their cos terms.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternative idea: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) [ (l sin δ_l - δ_l cos δ_l ) ] multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, earlier I found f = sum [ (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) ] / k.

But in the previous approach, this sum was real. So, Im f = 0, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the imaginary part in that approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the term ( l sin δ - δ cos δ ) in terms of sine and cosine.

Wait, let's compute each Term_l = (2l+1) ( l sin δ - δ cos δ )

Let me compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90°.

Term_0 = 1 * (0 * sin90 - 90 * cos90 ) → 0 - 90*0 → 0.

l=1: δ=67°.

Term_1=3*(1 * sin67 - 67 * cos67 )

Compute sin67≈0.9205, cos67≈0.3907.

So,

Term_1=3*(0.9205 - 67 * 0.3907 )

Compute 67 * 0.3907 ≈26.187.

So,

0.9205 -26.187 ≈-25.2665.

Multiply by 3: Term_1≈-75.7995.

l=2: δ=55°.

Term_2=5*(2 sin55 -55 cos55 )

sin55≈0.8192, cos55≈0.5736.

Compute 2 * 0.8192 =1.6384.

55 * 0.5736≈31.548.

So,

1.6384 -31.548 ≈-30. (1.6384-31.548= -30. approx)

So,

Term_2=5*(-29.9096)≈-149.548.

Wait, 5 * (1.6384 -31.548 )=5*(-29.9096 )= -149.548.

l=3: δ=30°.

Term_3=7*(3 sin30 -30 cos30 )

sin30=0.5, cos30≈0.8660.

So,

3 *0.5=1.5.

30 *0.8660≈25.98.

So,

1.5 -25.98= -24.48.

Multiply by7: Term_3≈-171.36.

l=4: δ=13°.

Term_4=9*(4 sin13 -13 cos13 )

sin13≈0.2249, cos13≈0.9744.

So,

4 *0.2249≈0.8996.

13 *0.9744≈12.667.

0.8996 -12.667≈-11.7674.

Multiply by9: Term_4≈-105.9066.

Now, sum all the terms:

Sum = Term_0 + Term_1 + Term_2 + Term_3 + Term_4.

= 0 + (-75.7995) + (-149.548) + (-171.36) + (-105.9066 )

Adding:

0 → 0.

-75.7995 → sum=-75.7995.

-149.548 → sum= -75.7995 -149.548= -225.3475.

-171.36 → sum= -225.3475 -171.36= -396.7075.

-105.9066 → sum= -396.7075 -105.9066= -502.6141.

So, total sum is approximately -502.6141.

Now, f = sum /k → k=0.253 fm^-1.

So,

f ≈ (-502.6141) / 0.253 ≈-1986.5 fm.

But this is a real number. So the imaginary part is zero, which can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. I'm probably making a mistake in the approach.

Another thought: Perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum over l of ( (2l+1) (δ_l) ) / (2k).

Wait, Sum (2l+1) δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 *90=90.

l=1:3 *67=201.

l=2:5 *55=275.

l=3:7 *30=210.

l=4:9 *13=117.

Sum: 90+201=291; +275=566; +210=776; +117=893.

Im f = sum/(2k) → 893/(2*0.253) )=893/0.506≈1765.0 fm.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider using the formula Im f = (sum (2l+1) (δ_l) ) /k.

So,

Im f=893 / 0.253 ≈3529.6 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), multiply by (1/(2k)), and then take that as the imaginary part.

As before, the sum is 16.864, so Im f=16.864/(2*0.253)=33.32 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (sum ( (2l+1) ( l sin δ_l - δ_l cos δ_l ) ) ) / (2k) )

In our earlier calculation, the sum was -502.6141, so Im f = (-502.6141)/(2*0.253)= (-502.6141)/0.506≈-993.28 fm.

But that's also not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion of the term.

Alternative approach: Looking up the formula.

Upon checking, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l )

Which is the formula I used earlier.

So according to this, Im f(0) = 16.864 / (2k) → 16.864/(2*0.253)=33.32 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial wave number calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k more accurately.

Let me recompute k. The formula is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

E=50 MeV.

But wait, in natural units, ħ c=197.329 MeV fm.

So, E=50 MeV.

So, the momentum p is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But since E >> m c^2, we can approximate p ≈ E/c.

p= E/(c) =50 (MeV)/(c) → in units where ħ c=197.329 MeV fm, p = E/(c) → 50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ) → since p = E/(c) → p = E/(c) → so, p = (E * ħ c) )/(c * ħ c ) → wait, perhaps better to compute k as k = E/(ħ c).

So, k = 50 / 197.329 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

k = 50 / 197.329 → let me compute 50 / 197.329.

197.329 → 197.329 ≈197.33.

50/197.33 = approximately 0.2533 fm^-1.

So, 2k=0.5066 fm^-1.

Sum=16.864.

Im f = 16.864 /0.5066 ≈33.28 fm.

Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the contribution from each phase shift differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k).

Which would give Im f=13.3815/(2k) → 13.3815/(2*0.2533)=13.3815/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 6.7 times 26.42. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have sin(δ_l) multiplied by (2l +1), and then multiplied by 1/k, not divided.

Wait, let me compute Im f= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) /k.

Which would be 13.3815 /0.2533≈52.84 fm.

Still not an option.

Another thought: Maybe the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees.

Wait! Oh, right! I think I made a mistake in converting degrees to radians. Because the formula uses δ in radians, not degrees. I was treating them as degrees, but perhaps they should be converted to radians first.

So, let's recalculate the sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), but with δ in radians.

Compute each δ in radians:

δ_0=90° = π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ_1=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ_2=55° →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

δ_3=30° →π/6≈0.523599 rad.

δ_4=13° →13 * π/180 ≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute each (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) using radians.

l=0: δ=1.5708 rad → 2δ=3.1416 rad → sin(3.1416)=0 → term 0.

l=1: δ=1.16937 → 2δ=2.33874 rad → sin(2.33874)= approx 0.737.

(2l+1)=3 → term=3*0.737≈2.211.

l=2: δ=0.95993 →2δ=1.91986 rad → sin(1.91986)= approx 0.944.

(2l+1)=5 →5*0.944≈4.72.

l=3: δ=0.523599 →2δ=1.047198 rad → sin(1.047198)= approx 0.8660.

(2l+1)=7 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=0.226893 →2δ=0.453786 rad → sin≈0.440.

(2l+1)=9 →9 *0.440≈3.96.

Now summing:

l=0:0

l=1:2.211 → sum=2.211.

l=2:4.72 → sum=6.931.

l=3:6.062 → sum=12.993.

l=4:3.96 → sum=16.953.

So sum≈16.953.

Now, compute Im f= sum/(2k) → 16.953/(2*0.2533 )=16.953/0.5066≈33.43 fm.

Still not matching any options. So perhaps even with radians, it's the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k).

Which would be sum in radians:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0:1 * sin(1.5708)=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(1.16937)=3*(0.9205)=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(0.95993)=5*(0.8192)=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(0.523599)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(0.226893)=9*(0.2249)=2.024.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.024=13.3815.

Im f=13.3815/(2k)=13.3815/(2*0.2533)=13.3815/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, the options have option B as 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times 33.43. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10^2 somewhere.

Another idea: Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

k = E/(ħ c) =50/(197.329)= approx 0.2533 fm^-1.

But wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So, perhaps when using ħ c in MeV fm, the units are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in inverse meters.

Wait, 1 fm^-1 = 1e15 m^-1.

But I'm not sure that's the issue. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the momentum in units of MeV/c.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is in a different unit. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in units of MeV/c.

Wait, let me compute k using natural units where ħ=c=1.

In natural units, E (MeV) → momentum p = E (since E=pc).

Wave number k = p/(ħ) → but in natural units, ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s → but perhaps it's easier to use GeV.

Wait, 50 MeV is 0.05 GeV.

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Another approach: Compute k in units of fm^-1.

The formula is k = sqrt(2 m E ) / ħ.

m is the electron mass: m=9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-14 J.

So,

k= sqrt( 2 * m * E ) / ħ.

Compute numerator:

2 * m * E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-14 J = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-14 = 2 *7.298e-45 =1.4596e-44.

sqrt(1.4596e-44)= approx 1.208e-22 m^-1.

But 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1.

So,

k=1.208e-22 m^-1 * 1e15 fm^-1/m^-1 → 1.208e-7 fm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. It must be a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

m =9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-14 J.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

Compute numerator: 2 m E =2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-14 = 2 * (7.298e-45) )=1.4596e-44.

sqrt(1.4596e-44)= approx 1.208e-22 m^-1.

Denominator: ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So,

k= (1.208e-22 m^-1) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) )

But J= kg m²/s², so J s = kg m²/s.

So,

k = (1.208e-22 m^-1 ) * (s)/(1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s )

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using units would help.

Wait, perhaps better to use the relation k = E/(ħ c) → because E=pc, and k = p/ħ.

So,

E=50 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k=50 MeV/(197.33 MeV fm )=50/197.33 fm^-1 ≈0.2533 fm^-1.

So, same as before. So I think the calculation is correct.

But the problem is that the imaginary part of f is about 33 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, and Im f = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k).

Which would give 13.3815 /0.2533 ≈52.84 fm.

No, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) * 1/(k).

Which would be 16.953 /0.2533 ≈66.93 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think again.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} (l - i δ_l ) - e^{-i δ_l} ( l +i δ_l ) ) ]

We can write each term as [ e^{i δ} (l -i δ) - e^{-i δ} (l +i δ) ].

Let me compute the imaginary part of each term.

Expressed as a complex number, each term is A + i B. The sum will have a real and imaginary part.

But since the overall f is scaled by 1/(2ik), which is a purely imaginary factor (since k is real), the real and imaginary parts of the sum will contribute to the imaginary part of f.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part by looking at each term's imaginary component.

Each term is (2l +1) [ e^{i δ} (l -i δ) - e^{-i δ} (l +i δ) ]

Expand each part:

e^{i δ} (l -i δ) = l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ}.

Similarly, e^{-i δ} (l +i δ) = l e^{-i δ} +i δ e^{-i δ}.

So,

Term = (2l +1)[ l e^{i δ} - i δ e^{i δ} - l e^{-i δ} - i δ e^{-i δ} ]

= (2l +1) [ l (e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ}) - i δ (e^{i δ} + e^{-i δ}) ]

As before.

We can write this as:

= (2l +1) [ 2i l sin δ - 2i δ cos δ ]

= (2l +1) * 2i [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ]

So, each term is 2i (2l+1) [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ].

Thus, the sum over l is 2i sum (2l+1)( l sin δ - δ cos δ ).

Now, f = (1/(2ik)) * sum → 1/(2ik) * 2i sum → sum/(k).

But each term in the sum is [ l sin δ - δ cos δ ] multiplied by (2l+1).

So, f is (sum)/(k ), where sum is real.

Thus, f is real, so the imaginary part is zero, which can't be correct. But this contradicts the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. If the sum is purely real, then f is real, so Im f =0. But the options don't have zero, so perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives Im f=13.3815/(2*0.2533)≈26.42 fm.

But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but the question clearly states the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest option is B)355.351 fm. But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula Im f = sum ( (2l+1) ( l sin δ_l - δ_l cos δ_l ) ) * (1/k )

Which would give Im f= (-502.6141)/0.2533≈-1986.5 fm.

No, that's not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about half of option B (355.351) and option D is 251.271.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach involves using the formula Im f = sum ( (2l+1) ( δ_l ) ) / (2k )

Sum (2l+1) δ_l is 893.

So Im f=893/(2k )=893/(2*0.2533)=893/0.5066≈1765 fm.

Not matching, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum (sum (2l+1) δ_l ) and then multiply by (1/k )

Which gives 893 /0.2533≈3524 fm.

But option B is 355.351, which is about 10 times less.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in converting degrees to radians. Let me recompute the sum with radians in the formula Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) / (2k )

With δ in radians:

sum=16.953.

k=0.2533.

Im f=16.953/(2*0.2533)=16.953/0.5066≈33.43 fm.

No match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So maybe I should only include l=0 to l=4.

Wait, I did include l=0 to l=4, so that's correct.

Hmm.

Another idea: Perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) ) * (1/k )

Which gives 13.3815 /0.2533≈52.84 fm.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) * (1/(2k)) )

Which gives 26.42 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is not among the options. But since that's not possible, perhaps I should re-examine the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) [ ( l sin δ_l - δ_l cos δ_l ) ]) * (1/k )

Which gives Im f = (-502.6141 )/0.2533≈-1986.5 fm.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) [ l sin δ_l + δ_l cos δ_l ]) * (1/k )

Let me compute this sum.

Compute each Term_l = (2l+1) [ l sin δ_l + δ_l cos δ_l ]

l=0: 1*(0 +90 *0 )=0.

l=1:3 [1 sin67 +67 cos67 ].

sin67≈0.9205, cos67≈0.3907.

So,

1 *0.9205=0.9205.

67 *0.3907≈26.187.

Sum:0.9205 +26.187≈27.1075.

Multiply by3: 81.3225.

l=2:5 [2 sin55 +55 cos55 ]

sin55≈0.8192, cos55≈0.5736.

2 *0.8192=1.6384.

55 *0.5736≈31.548.

Sum:1.6384 +31.548=33.1864.

Multiply by5:165.932.

l=3:7 [3 sin30 +30 cos30 ]

sin30=0.5, cos30≈0.8660.

3 *0.5=1.5.

30 *0.8660≈25.98.

Sum:1.5 +25.98=27.48.

Multiply by7:192.36.

l=4:9 [4 sin13 +13 cos13 ]

sin13≈0.2249, cos13≈0.9744.

4 *0.2249≈0.8996.

13 *0.9744≈12.667.

Sum:0.8996 +12.667≈13.5666.

Multiply by9:122.1.

Now, sum all terms:

0 +81.3225=81.3225.

+165.932=247.2545.

+192.36=439.6145.

+122.1=561.7145.

So sum is 561.7145.

Im f= sum/k =561.7145/0.2533≈2217.3 fm.

But that's not an option either.

I think I'm stuck and can't find an approach that matches the given options. Since the possible answers don't match my calculations, perhaps I should choose the closest option based on a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Which gives 13.3815/(2*0.2533)=26.42 fm.

But the options don't have this. Alternatively, maybe I should compute using a different approach.

Another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by:

Im f = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Which with the given phase shifts (converted to radians) gives 16.953/(2*0.2533)=33.43 fm.

Still no match.

Perhaps I should accept that I can't find an approach that aligns with any of the options and make an educated guess. Looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.3 times 33.43. But I don't know why that factor would apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, considering some factor I missed. But I'm not sure.

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, the problem involves using the given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$ and the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude:

\[
\text{Im}f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, given by:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c},
\]

with $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ and $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$. This gives:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum $\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$
For each $l$, $\delta_l$ is converted to radians, and $\sin(2\delta_l)$ is calculated:

- $l=0$: $\delta_0 = 90^\circ = \pi/2 \, \text{rad}$, $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(\pi) = 0$, term = $1 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- $l=1$: $\delta_1 = 67^\circ \approx 1.169 \, \text{rad}$, $\sin(2\delta_1) \approx \sin(2.339) \approx 0.737$, term = $3 \cdot 0.737 \approx 2.211$.
- $l=2$: $\delta_2 = 55^\circ \approx 0.959 \, \text{rad}$, $\sin(2\delta_2) \approx \sin(1.919) \approx 0.944$, term = $5 \cdot 0.944 \approx 4.720$.
- $l=3$: $\delta_3 = 30^\circ = \pi/6 \, \text{rad}$, $\sin(2\delta_3) \approx \sin(1.047) \approx 0.866$, term = $7 \cdot 0.866 \approx 6.062$.
- $l=4$: $\delta_4 = 13^\circ \approx 0.227 \, \text{rad}$, $\sin(2\delta_4) \approx \sin(0.454) \approx 0.440$, term = $9 \cdot 0.440 \approx 3.960$.

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.211 + 4.720 + 6.062 + 3.960 = 16.953.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\text{Im}f(0)$
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}f(0) = \frac{\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)}{2k},
\]

substitute $\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 16.953$ and $k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$:

\[
\text{Im}f(0) = \frac{16.953}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{16.953}{0.506} \approx 33.43 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
The calculated value of $\text{Im}f(0) \approx 33.43 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 5.3 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or a missing factor in the interpretation of the formula.

### Final Answer
Based on the closest match to the computed value, the answer is:

**Answer: C**
