Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They want to overexpress this protein, so they modified the gene by adding a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they check the expression, they can't overexpress the protein as expected. So, the question is why.

The construct's plus strand sequence is provided. The issue must be in the construct itself because the problem arises after they made it. So the problem is probably in the DNA sequence causing the protein not to be expressed correctly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So the HA tag might have a mutation. But if the HA tag is wrong, maybe the protein is expressed but not detected. But in the question, the issue is overexpression, not detection. So maybe this isn't the main problem here. But I'm not sure.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That suggests a premature stop codon. If the DNA has a stop codon early, the ribosome would terminate early, making a truncated protein. So looking at the sequence, let me check for any stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the open reading frame. Let's look for triplets.

Looking at the DNA sequence, which is the coding (sense) strand, so mRNA would be complementary. So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA but T becomes U. Let me scan for in-frame stops.

Looking through the sequence... Let's see. The first codon is ATG, which is start. Then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), etc. Wait, looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the mRNA reading frame.

Hmm, I'll go through the mRNA sequence (DNA's plus strand is the coding, mRNA is same except T to U). So looking for ...GAA, which is glutamic acid. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the given DNA is the plus strand, which is the same as mRNA except T becomes U. So the mRNA would be 5' ... ATG ... (the rest). So looking for any TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking for the triplet TGA in the DNA (since mRNA is T becomes U, so TGA in DNA is TGA in mRNA, which is a stop. Wait no: mRNA would have U instead of T. So, for example, the DNA sequence TGA would be UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking through the DNA sequence for any TGA. Let me check.

Looking at the DNA sequence:

...TCGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TGA in the DNA. Hmm, I see a TGA near the end. Let me look: 

Looking at the end of the sequence, the last part is ...CGAGTGA. So DNA is CGAGTGA. So mRNA would be CGAGUGA. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the DNA is plus strand, so mRNA is complementary to the template. Wait, no, the mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the template strand. Wait, no, the plus strand is the sense strand, so the mRNA is same as plus strand except T to U.

Wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA would be same as the plus strand but with U instead of T. So looking for TGA in the DNA. Let's see:

Is there a TGA in the DNA sequence? Let me scan.

Looking for the pattern T-G-A in the DNA.

Looking through the sequence:

... TACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA ...

Wait, I see TGA near the end. Let me check: 

... TGA ... looking at the end, the last few letters are ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is AGTGA. Wait, no, each codon is 3 letters.

Wait, the last part is AGTGA, which is two codons. Wait, let me see:

Wait, the DNA ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last 6 nucleotides are GAGTGA. So that's two codons: GAG and TGA.

Wait, GAG is the DNA. The mRNA would be GAG (Glu) and UGA (stop). So in the mRNA, the last two codons are GAG and UGA. So the stop codon is at the end. So the mRNA would have a stop codon at the end, which is correct.

But earlier in the DNA, is there any TGA within the coding sequence? Let me look before the end.

Looking through the sequence, I see another part: ...GGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, there's a TGA here: ...TGAACG... So the DNA has TGAACG. So the triplet would be TGA (positions 1-3), then AAC (positions 4-6), etc.

Wait, so TGA is in the DNA, but it's in the middle of the sequence. Let me see: the DNA has ...TGAACG..., so the triplet is T G A, but is it in frame?

Wait, the reading frame starts at the beginning with ATG. So the sequence is:

ATG ... [various codons] ... TGA ... etc.

So the TGA in the DNA would be a TGA codon in the mRNA (since mRNA is T to U in the DNA). Wait, no, the DNA's T becomes U in mRNA. So the DNA TGA would be UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, so if the DNA has a TGA in the middle, then the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop. So the ribosome would stop there, making a shorter protein. So if the HA tag is at the beginning, then the HA might have a stop codon in the middle, so the protein is not expressed beyond that point.

Wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the construct starts with ATG (start), then the HA tag sequence, then the GADD45G sequence.

If the DNA has a TGA (in the coding sequence), then the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate early, producing a truncated protein or no protein at all, depending on when the stop is.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I think the presence of a TGA in the middle would disrupt the expression.

Wait, but in the given DNA, the plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA is same as the plus strand but U instead of T. So looking for TGA in the plus strand would lead to UGA in mRNA, a stop.

So does the given DNA have TGA in the coding sequence? Let me check.

Looking again:

The DNA sequence is:

5'ATG... (various bases) ...TGAACGACTGGGT...

Wait, the 'TGA' is in the middle. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop. So the ribosome would stop there, leading to a truncated protein. So the HA tag might not even be correctly expressed because the stop is in the middle.

So the issue is that the construct has a premature stop codon (UGA in mRNA) in the middle. Therefore, the protein isn't being expressed correctly because translation stops early.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would fit. But let me check all options.

Option C says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis. That's about the protein being broken down after it's made, but the issue here is that the protein isn't expressed. So probably not C.

Option D: The tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is another stop codon. But in the mRNA, if there's a UAA, the mouse's ribosome would have a tRNA for that? Wait, no. The standard stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. All three are recognized by release factors, and no tRNAs have anticodons for them. So if the mRNA has a UAA, the ribosome would stop. But in the DNA, that would be TAA. So looking for TAA in the DNA.

In the given DNA, is there a TAA? Let me scan.

Looking for TAA in the DNA:

The DNA starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, etc. Let me see.

Looking through the sequence: ...ATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see a TGA but not a TAA. So the DNA has a TGA, which would lead to a UGA in mRNA, which is a stop. So option B could be the issue.

Another point: the problem is that the construct cannot overexpress the protein, so the gene isn't being expressed, or the protein is not made correctly.

If the construct has a stop codon, the mRNA would be translated until that point, then stop. So the protein would be shorter. But the question states that the overexpression isn't happening. So perhaps the construct isn't being expressed at all, or the protein is not functional.

Wait, but why would the presence of a stop codon prevent expression? Well, the presence of a stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate early, so the protein is shorter. But why would the researchers not see any overexpression? Maybe the stop codon is in the HA tag, so the HA tag isn't expressed, making the protein undetectable, but the rest of the protein might be expressed? Or perhaps the HA tag is in the middle, so the stop is after it.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So if the stop codon is in the HA tag, then the HA isn't made, and the GADD45G isn't either because the stop is in the middle.

Alternatively, if the stop is after the HA tag, then the HA would be expressed, but the GADD45G would not. So the researchers might detect the HA but not the full-length protein. But in the question, the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed, so perhaps the construct isn't being expressed at all.

Wait, another possibility: the GADD45G coding sequence might have a stop codon, making the protein not expressed beyond that point. But why would that prevent overexpression? Maybe the presence of the stop codon leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. So the mRNA is degraded, and not translated.

Ah! That's a possibility. If the mRNA has a premature stop codon, the cell's quality control (nonsense-mediated decay) would degrade the mRNA, leading to less or no protein expression. So the construct's mRNA is being degraded, hence no overexpression.

So in the DNA, there's a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, leading to mRNA being targeted for degradation. That would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed.

Which option corresponds to this? Let me check.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would result in a truncated protein, but if the mRNA is subject to NMD, then the construct's mRNA is not expressed.

Wait, but the question says they couldn't overexpress the protein. So if the mRNA is not present, the protein wouldn't be either. Alternatively, if the mRNA is made but the protein is truncated, then perhaps it's not functional. But the question is about why overexpression isn't happening.

Wait, but the presence of a stop codon in the middle would lead to the mRNA being subject to NMD, so it's degraded, so the protein isn't made. So the problem is the presence of a stop codon, leading to NMD.

So looking at the options, which option points to a premature stop codon?

Option B is about the ribosome terminating early, leading to a truncated protein. But that would not necessarily cause the mRNA to be degraded. Nonsense-mediated decay is a separate process.

Wait, the question is about why they can't overexpress the protein. So perhaps the construct has a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the middle, leading to NMD. So the mRNA is not present because it's degraded.

So which option matches this scenario? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: HA has a missense. This could make the HA tag not functional, but the rest of the protein could still be expressed. But in the given scenario, the entire protein isn't being expressed. So this might not be the case.

Option B: Ribosome stops early. If the mRNA has a stop codon, the ribosome would stop, but if the stop is in the middle, you get a truncated protein, but mRNA is intact. However, if the stop is in the first exon or near the beginning, NMD may occur, leading to mRNA degradation. So perhaps this is the case.

So the presence of a premature stop codon in the mRNA leads to NMD, so the mRNA isn't translated, hence no protein overexpression.

So why does the given DNA have a TGA (which is a stop codon in mRNA as UGA). Therefore, the construct's DNA has a premature stop codon, leading to NMD.

So the problem is the presence of a premature stop codon in the construct.

Looking at the options, the correct issue is that the mRNA has a premature stop codon, causing the mRNA to be degraded. But the options don't directly state that. Let me see the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. So if the ribosome terminates early, you get a truncated protein. But if that's in the middle, the protein may not function, but the mRNA would still be present. However, if the stop is in the first part, NMD may occur.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but why would the presence of a stop codon prevent overexpression? Because the mRNA isn't translated, because the ribosome stops early.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop codon in the HA tag's sequence (the first part) leads to no HA tag being made, but the GADD45G might be expressed. But the construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the stop codon might be in the HA tag, which is N-terminal. So the HA isn't made, and the GADD45G isn't either because the stop is in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct has a stop codon after the HA tag, so the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G isn't.

Wait, but in the given DNA sequence, the HA is at the N-terminus. So the HA's coding sequence is at the beginning, followed by GADD45G.

So if the HA's sequence includes a stop codon, then the HA isn't made, and the GADD45G isn't either, leading to no protein. Alternatively, the stop codon is within the HA, so the HA is not expressed, but the GADD45G is.

Wait, no. Because the HA is at the N-terminus, the stop codon would cause the entire protein to be truncated. So the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed either.

But the problem is that the construct isn't overexpressing the protein, so perhaps the entire protein isn't made.

Wait, but the given DNA sequence includes the HA and all of GADD45G's coding sequence. If somewhere in the middle, a stop is introduced, the HA would be made, but the GADD45G wouldn't. So perhaps the HA is expressed, but the GADD45G is not.

But the question is about overexpressing the GADD45G. So if the GADD45G isn't expressed, then the researchers can't do their experiment.

So the issue is a premature stop codon in the construct, causing the GADD45G not to be made. So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence.

Looking back, the options:

A) HA has a missense mutation. So the HA is faulty, but the rest of the protein could still be expressed?

B) Ribosome stops early. So the protein is truncated, possibly leading to no functional protein, but the mRNA is present.

C) No linker causing proteolysis. If the protein is made, it's being degraded. But in the question, the protein isn't expressed, so likely not.

D) No tRNA for UAA. But the mRNA has UGA, which is a stop, not UAA. So this is irrelevant.

So the correct answer is B: the ribosome terminated early due to a premature stop codon.

Wait, but let me check the DNA again. The DNA has a TGA in the middle. So the mRNA would have UGA, a stop codon. Thus, the ribosome would stop, leading to a truncated protein. So the protein isn't overexpressed because it's not the full-length, but why would the researchers not see any expression?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the stop codon leads to NMD, so the mRNA is not present, leading to no protein. However, none of the options mention NMD.

So among the given options, the issue is that the ribosome stops, so the protein isn't made beyond that point. So the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein by introducing an inducible overexpression construct with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the construct fails to overexpress the protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals a premature stop codon (UGA in mRNA, corresponding to TGA in DNA) in the middle of the coding sequence. This stop codon disrupts translation, causing the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all. Additionally, the presence of a premature stop codon could trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mRNA, further reducing or eliminating protein expression.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence would not necessarily prevent the expression of the entire protein. The HA tag might be non-functional, but the GADD45G portion could still be expressed. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B:** The premature stop codon (UGA in mRNA) causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. This prevents the full-length protein from being expressed, aligning with the observed lack of overexpression.
- **Option C:** Proteolysis of the nascent chain due to a lack of a linker sequence would occur after the protein is expressed. However, the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all, making this option unlikely.
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant because the mRNA contains a UGA codon (not UAA), which is a well-known stop codon.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length protein. This aligns with **Option B**.

Answer: B
