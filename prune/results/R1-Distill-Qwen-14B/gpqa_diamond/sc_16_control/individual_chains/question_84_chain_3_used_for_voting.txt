Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me start by recalling what I know about finite difference methods and parallel algorithms for PDEs. When dealing with heat equations, especially in higher dimensions, the system of equations can get quite large. Using finite differences, we often end up with a large matrix that needs to be solved or manipulated, like exponentiating it over time steps.

In sequential algorithms, each step might depend on the previous one, so you process them one after another. But in parallel algorithms, you want to split the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously. So, how does that relate to matrix exponentials and fractional approximations?

Matrix exponential functions are often involved in solving systems where the solution involves e^(At), like in exponential time integration methods. For large matrices, computing e^(At) directly isn't feasible, so approximations are used. Fractional approximation methods, such as those based on Padé approximants or other rational function approximations, aim to approximate the matrix exponential with a fraction of polynomials.

Now, the question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm to be parallel. I remember that splitting the matrix into blocks or submatrices can allow for parallel computation. But wait, how does that tie into the options given?

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: This is important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate, but I don't think it's the key factor for converting to a parallel algorithm.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the problem, but I'm not sure how they directly relate to parallelism. Maybe in terms of how the boundary conditions are handled across different parts of the domain, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximation methods often involve rational functions, which can have poles in the complex plane. The distribution of these poles might affect convergence and stability, but how does that tie into parallel processing?

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fraction decomposition breaks a rational function into simpler terms. If the approximation can be decomposed into linear terms, each term might correspond to a part that can be computed in parallel because they don't interfere with each other. For example, if you have e^(AΔt) as a sum of terms like e^(λ_i Δt), each e^(λ_i Δt) could be computed separately, perhaps allowing parallel computation of each term.

Wait, but wait. The matrix exponential approximation might be expressed as a sum of exponentials of simpler matrices. If the approximation can be linearly decomposed into partial fractions, each part could be handled in parallel. That would allow the algorithm to split the computation across multiple processors, each handling a part of the decomposition.

So, if D is the linear partial fraction decomposition, that would enable parallel computation because each term in the decomposition can be computed independently. So option D seems like a good candidate.

Alternatively, complex roots (option C) might affect the stability or convergence rate but maybe not directly the parallelizability. Whereas the partial fractions would allow splitting the problem into multiple independent parts, which is exactly what you need for parallelism.

So, putting it all together, the key factor is the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation, which allows each term to be computed in parallel.

When solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting, the goal is to approximate the matrix exponential function efficiently. Sequential algorithms typically process steps sequentially, but parallel algorithms require splitting the problem into independent parts that can be computed simultaneously. Fractional approximation methods, such as those based on rational functions, are often used to approximate the matrix exponential. 

Among the options provided:

- **Stability analysis (A):** While important for ensuring numerical accuracy and preventing errors from growing unbounded, it does not directly address the conversion to a parallel algorithm.
- **Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (B):** Nonlocal boundary conditions might complicate the problem, but they do not inherently enable parallel computation.
- **Complex roots of fractional approximation (C):** The distribution of complex roots in the rational function approximation affects convergence and stability but does not directly facilitate parallelism.
- **Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation (D):** Linear partial fraction decomposition breaks the rational function into simpler terms, each of which can be computed independently. This decomposition is key to enabling parallel computation, as it allows the problem to be split into independent parts that can be processed simultaneously.

The linear partial fraction decomposition is the critical factor that enables the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one by allowing independent computation of each term in the decomposition.
