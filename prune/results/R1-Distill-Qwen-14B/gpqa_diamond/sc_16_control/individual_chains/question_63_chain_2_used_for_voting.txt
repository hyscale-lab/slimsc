Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, wait, I think the rigid rotor model is when the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows the bond to stretch a bit, so that's the vibration part. So this molecule can rotate and vibrate, and both are quantized.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually means the lowest energy state. So for both rotation and vibration, the fundamental is the lowest possible energy. Now, the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, so what's the next state after the fundamental? Because the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized, the next state would be the first excited state.

But wait, which transition are we considering—vibration, rotation, or both? Because in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would probably be the first excited state of either rotation or vibration, whichever has the lower energy transition.

Wait, but the photon's energy is determined by the energy difference between the states. So we need to calculate the energy required to go from the current state to the next possible state, which I think would be the next vibrational state. Because usually, vibrational transitions are higher in energy than rotational ones, but wait, depends on the constants.

Wait, what's the formula for the energy levels of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model? I think it's a combination of the rotational energy and vibrational energy. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) * ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

So the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. So in the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. The next lowest state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. We need to find which of these requires less energy.

Let's compute the energy for each transition. The current state is (v=0, J=0). The next state could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). So the energy difference for the vibrational transition is from v=0 to v=1. The energy for that is (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω.

For the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1. The rotational energy at J=1 is B*(1)(2) = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B - 0 = 2B.

So which is smaller: ħω or 2B? That will determine which transition is lower in energy. So the photon's energy should match the lower of the two, so that the molecule can transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So I need to calculate both ħω and 2B, and see which is smaller.

First, let's find ħω. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. The angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approximately 4.218e-20 J.

Next, B, the rotational constant. B is given by (h/(8π² c I)) where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, alternatively, B can be calculated using B = (ħ²)/(2I), but I think another formula. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2I). So yeah, B is ħ²/(2I).

So I need to compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

μ is the reduced mass, which is (m_X * m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y). The masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. 1 amu is about 1.660539e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 * 1.660539e-27 kg = 3.321078e-26 kg.

My = 2 * 1.660539e-27 kg = 3.321078e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321078e-26 * 3.321078e-27) / (3.321078e-26 + 3.321078e-27).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 3.321078e-26 * 3.321078e-27.

= (3.321078)^2 * 1e-53.

3.321078 squared is approximately 11.03.

So numerator is about 11.03e-53 kg² m²?

Wait, no, because I'm dealing with kg. Wait, wait, the units for μ would be kg. Because I is μ r². So μ is in kg.

Wait, okay, let's compute the exact numbers.

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.660539e-27 kg = 3.321078e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321078e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321078e-26 * 3.321078e-27 ) / (3.321078e-26 + 3.321078e-27 )

Let me compute denominator first: 3.321078e-26 + 3.321078e-27 = 3.321078e-26 + 0.3321078e-26 = 3.6531858e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.321078e-26) * (3.321078e-27) = (3.321078)^2 * 1e-53 = approximately 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg².

Wait, no. Wait, 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = 3.321^2 * 1e-26-27 = 11.03 *1e-53 = 1.103e-52.

So μ = (1.103e-52) / (3.653e-26) = approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute 1.103e-52 / 3.653e-26:

Divide 1.103 by 3.653: approximately 0.3017.

So exponent: 1e-52 / 1e-26 = 1e-26.

So 0.3017e-26 = 3.017e-27 kg.

So μ is approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

I is the moment of inertia, I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2I).

Wait, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2068e-46) )

Denominator: 2 * 1.2068e-46 = 2.4136e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4136e-46 ≈ approximately 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that division:

1.112e-68 / 2.4136e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4136) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4136 ≈ 0.4607.

So B ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, but that's B in Joules. So the energy for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B, which would be 2 *4.607e-23 = 9.214e-23 J.

Wait, but wait! Did I compute B correctly? Because I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The rotational energy levels are E = B J (J+1), and B is (ħ²)/(2I) * something? Alternatively, sometimes B is given as (h)/(8π² c I), but I think that's for the rotational constant in cm^-1. Hmm, perhaps I should have used a different approach.

Wait, another formula for B is B = (h)/(8π² c I) * something? No, wait, B is the rotational constant in terms of energy. Let me think again. The formula I used, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1), is correct. So yes, B is ħ²/(2I).

Wait, but let me check the units. ħ has units of J·s, squared would be J² s². I is kg·m². So ħ²/(2I) would have units (J² s²)/(kg m²) ). Hmm, J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg² m^4 / s^4.

So (kg² m^4 / s^4) * s² ) / (kg m² ) ) = (kg^2 m^4 s^2 ) / (s^4 kg m^2 )) ) = (kg m²)/s², which is J. So yes, B is in Joules. So the calculation seems correct.

So B is about 4.607e-23 J.

So the energy difference ΔE for the rotational transition is 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Earlier, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib was ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state with the lowest energy would be the next possible state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0.

But since the rotational transition requires less energy (9.2e-23 J) than the vibrational transition (4.2e-20 J), the molecule can be excited by a photon with the rotational energy.

So the photon's energy should match this 9.2e-23 J. Now, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light.

Wait, wait, actually, the energy of a photon is E = h f = p c, since f = c / λ, and p = h / (λ), so E = p c.

So p = E / c.

So once we compute E as 9.214e-23 J, then p = 9.214e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 Ns. Since 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s, so our p is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Because the options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, but my calculation gives ~1e-31, which is four orders of magnitude smaller.

Wait, I must have made an error. Let me recheck the calculations. Perhaps I messed up the formula for B.

Alternative approach: Maybe the rotational constant B is given in terms of angular frequency, not in Joules. Because sometimes in spectroscopy, B is expressed in terms of a rotational constant in wavenumbers (cm^-1), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy transition for rotation is in a different unit.

Wait, another thing: the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in Joules, correct. So J is 0, 1, 2, etc.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 2B. So 2B would be the energy needed for the rotational transition. But when I calculated B, I got 4.6e-23 J, so 2B is about 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then the momentum p is E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let's recompute B. Let's go step by step.

Calculate the moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ was computed as 3.017e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2068e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05)^2 = 1.1025, so 1.1025e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2068e-46 = 2.4136e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.1025e-68 / 2.4136e-46 = approx 4.566e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

Wait, but maybe I should have used B in terms of the rotational constant in cm^-1, which is B' = h/(8π² c I), and then the energy is B' h c, because the transition energy would be in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rotational constant as expressed in different units. Let me clarify.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in Joules. But another common way is to express the rotational constant in wavenumbers, where B' = h/(8π² c I), and the energy levels are E_rot = h c B' J (J+1). So perhaps the energy transition is calculated as h c B' (2J +1) or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the vibrational energy difference, not the rotational. Wait, but earlier calculation says the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the energy units. Let me double-check the vibrational energy.

Vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib = ħω.

Wait, ħ in J·s is 1.05457e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J, as before. So that's 4.2e-20 J.

Rotational energy difference is 2B = 9.2e-23 J, which is indeed lower.

So the photon's energy must be 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Hmm. Let me compute the momentum p again.

p = E / c.

E = 9.2e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.066e-31 kg·m/s = 3.066e-31 N·s.

But look at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) but the photon is absorbed to cause a transition to a higher vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation. So the energy required is the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy. However, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energy levels are considered together, and the fundamental state is the lowest combination of vibrational and rotational states. So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational.

Wait, the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state after the fundamental state would be the state with the next lowest energy, which could be either the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (v=0, J=1). Which of these has lower energy?

We calculated that the rotational transition requires ~9e-23 J, and the vibrational ~4e-20 J. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one. Thus, the photon's energy is the rotational one.

But then why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps I confused the photon's momentum with something else. Wait, maybe the question is about the change in momentum, but photons carry momentum p = E/c.

Wait, but according to my calculations, p is 3e-31 Ns. But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Alternative idea: Could the rotational energy be considered as E = (1/2) ħ ω_rot (J (J+1)), where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency. So the rotational energy levels would be E_rot = (1/2) ħ ω_rot J (J+1).

Wait, perhaps I should compute ω_rot and find the energy difference.

So for rotation, the energy levels are E_rot = (1/2) ħ ω_rot J (J+1).

So the rotational constant is B = ħ ω_rot / (2). So ω_rot = 2B/(ħ).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The moment of inertia I is μ r^2.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2 I)) J (J+1).

So the rotational angular frequency ω_rot is given by (ħ ω_rot) = sqrt( (E_rot) * (something) )? Hmm, perhaps another approach: the rotational constant B is sometimes expressed as B = ħ ω_rot / (2).

Alternatively, the energy levels can be written as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²) / (2 I).

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

But another approach is to calculate the rotational energy in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, I might have confused the energy difference calculation. Let me think of it in terms of the rotational energy levels.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1).

So for J=0, E=0.

For J=1, E= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ħ²/(I).

Wait, because E_J=1 is ħ²/(I), and E_J=0 is zero. So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Wait, so using this, let's recalculate that term.

I is 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 ≈ approx 9.21e-23 J.

Which matches my earlier calculation of 2B, because 2B is 2*(4.6e-23) = 9.2e-23 J. So same result.

So the energy required for the rotational transition is 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm. So the photon's momentum is p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate μ.

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

So Mx + My = 3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

Mx * My = 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53.

3.32^2 is approximately 11.0224, so 1.10224e-52 kg².

μ= 1.10224e-52 /3.652e-26 = ~3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, same as before. So I think the mistake isn't there.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the question refers to the molecule moving to the next state which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational levels, but that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational changes. But that would give a higher energy, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the change in angular momentum, but no, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, another possibility: Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia? Let me recalculate I.

I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m². Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reduced mass in atomic mass units (amu) instead of converting to kg. Oh wait, no, because the formula for I requires kg·m².

Hmm. So I'm confident my calculation is correct, but the photon's momentum is way smaller than the options. The options are 1e-28 Ns, which is larger by four orders of magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the photon's energy being the vibrational energy, not the rotational.

In that case, E = 4.218e-20 J. Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that matches.

But why would the photon's energy be the vibrational one if the rotational requires less energy?

Ah! Wait, maybe I got the model wrong. The non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotation-vibration model) considers that the bond length can change, so the vibrational energy is considered in combination with rotational energy. But the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state (v=0, J=0). The next state would be when either v increases by one or J increases by one. But the photon's energy may need to cause a change in both, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is whichever of the two (v=1 or J=1) has a lower energy.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have that energy. But that gives a momentum of 3e-31, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question requires the photon to cause a transition to the next energy level, which is the first excited vibrational state, irrespective of rotation. Because when considering diatomic molecules, often the vibrational transitions are considered in the context of the rigid rotor model, but perhaps in this case, the non-rigid model implies that the bond length changes, so the rotational energy also changes.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational energy.

So maybe the question is implying that the photon causes the molecule to move to the next vibrational state, regardless of rotation. So perhaps the rotational transitions are not considered here, and the photon's energy is the vibrational one.

In that case, the photon's momentum p = E/c = (ħω)/c.

Wait, but in that case, E = ħω is the energy, so p = ħω / c.

Compute that: ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s, ω=4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 4.218e-20 J, as before.

p = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = approx 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the correct approach is to take the vibrational energy transition, not the rotational, because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, but perhaps the vibrational transition is the only one considered, or maybe the rotational transitions are forbidden or higher in energy.

Wait, but earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon's energy be the vibrational one? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference for the vibrational transition is larger, but the photon must have that energy to cause a transition, but that doesn't fit with the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next energy level, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the absorption of a photon that causes a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which would be the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), regardless of the rotational transition. So in that case, the energy required is the vibrational one, which would give the momentum p as 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the question specify the non-rigid rotor model? Because in that model, both rotational and vibrational energies are considered. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, it can be excited by a lower energy photon to a higher rotational state. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me recompute B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2068e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4136e-46) = approx 4.607e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.214e-23 J.

But that leads to p=3e-31 Ns. So unless I made a mistake in the calculation, I think the correct answer would not match any of the options. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy, but only the vibrational. The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so it's a diatomic with both rotation and vibration.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE.

Thus, the rotational transition is lower in energy than the vibrational.

So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J.

But then, why don't any of the options match that? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the photon's energy in terms of angular frequency, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Did I convert the bond length correctly? The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, which would give option D. Maybe the rotational transitions are not considered in this question, despite the model being a rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy causing a transition to the next state, which is the first excited state, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration.

So, the next state after the fundamental is the next energy level, which could be either v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0. The question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the state with lower ΔE.

But according to the numbers, the rotational transition is lower.

So why is this not matching any options? I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B in a different way. Sometimes, B is given as B = h/(8π² c I), where I is the moment of inertia. Let me try that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

I is 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = h/(8 π² c I) = 6.626e-34 / (8 * (pi^2) *3e8 *1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

So denominator = 78.957 *3e8 *1.2068e-46.

3e8 * 1.2068e-46 = 3.6204e-38.

78.957 *3.6204e-38 ≈ 2.861e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.861e-36 ≈ approx 231.4 cm^-1.

Wait, that's in terms of wavenumbers. So the vibrational energy is in the range of 1e14 rad/s, but rotational is around 1e11 rad/s or so (since B is 231 cm^-1, which is about 2.31e3 cm^-1, which is 2.31e4 m^-1, so frequency is c * wavenumber, which is 3e8 m/s * 2.31e4 m^-1 = 6.93e12 rad/s, but wait, no, because wavenumber is 1/lambda, so the frequency would be c * wavenumber (in m^-1) × 1e2 (if in cm^-1). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, wavenumber (cm^-1) is nu / c, where c is in cm/s. So 231 cm^-1 would correspond to a frequency of 231 * 2.998e10 cm/s = 6.898e12 Hz.

But that's the rotational frequency, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the energy for the rotational transition, when expressed in terms of wavenumbers, would be E_rot = h c B_rot.

So B_rot (cm^-1) is 231.4.

So E_rot = h c B_rot = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 m/s * 231.4 /100 cm → wait, because cm^-1 is per cm, so to convert to m^-1, multiply by 100.

So 231.4 cm^-1 = 23140 m^-1.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s * 23140 m^-1.

So 3e8 *23140 = 6.942e12 m/s * m^-1 → unitless.

So 6.626e-34 *6.942e12 = approx 4.59e-21 J.

Wait, that's 4.59e-21 J for the rotational transition.

Earlier, the vibrational transition was 4.2e-20 J.

So now the rotational transition is 4.59e-21 J, which is lower than the vibrational 4.2e-20 J.

So the photon's energy should be the rotational one: 4.59e-21 J.

p = E/c = 4.59e-21 /3e8 = 1.53e-29 kg m/s = 1.53e-29 Ns.

But that's even smaller than previous calculations and not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me think about the problem again.

The question asks for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The molecule is modeled with rotation and vibration, so the next state is the one with the lowest possible energy higher than the current state.

The current state is (v=0, J=0). The next possible states are (v=1, J=0) and (v=0, J=1).

Which of these has a lower energy?

Compute E for both.

E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω = (1 + 1/2) ħω - (0 + 1/2) ħω = ħω.

E_rot = B J (J+1) = B (1)(2) = 2B.

So the energy of (v=1,J=0) is E_vib = ħω.

The energy of (v=0,J=1) is E_rot = 2B.

Which is smaller between ħω and 2B?

From earlier calculations:

ħω ≈4.2e-20 J,

2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

So 2B is smaller.

So the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon energy of 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, another approach: compute the energy for J=1.

E_rot = B * J (J+1) = B * 2.

If B is in terms of cm^-1, the energy is E_rot = h c B'.

Wait, earlier I calculated B' (rotational constant in cm^-1) as 231.4 cm^-1.

So E_rot = h c B' = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 m/s * 231.4 cm^-1.

Wait, 231.4 cm^-1 is 23140 m^-1.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 23140.

3e8 *23140 = 6.942e12.

6.626e-34 *6.942e12 = approx 4.593e-21 J.

Which is lower than the vibrational transition of 4.2e-20 J.

So photon's energy is 4.593e-21 J.

p = E/c = 4.593e-21 /3e8 = 1.531e-29 Ns.

Still, this isn't matching any options. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational, even though the rotational requires less energy. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering both a vibrational and a rotational transition, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate B using the formula B = (h/(8π² c I)).

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

8π² is about 78.957.

c is 3e8 m/s.

I is 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B =6.626e-34 / (78.957 *3e8 *1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator: 78.957 *3e8=2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.2068e-46 = 2.86e-36.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.86e-36 ≈ 231.5 cm^-1.

So as before.

So the rotational energy is E_rot = h c B' (2J+1) ?

Wait, no, for a transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = (2 B' h c) - 0 = 2 B' h c.

Wait, B' is in cm^-1, so E_rot in Joules is E = h c B' (J(J+1)).

So for J=1, E_rot = h c B' * 2.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

B'=231.4 cm^-1 = 23140 m^-1.

So E_rot =6.626e-34 *3e8 *23140.

=6.626e-34 *6.942e12 = approx 4.59e-21 J.

So the energy is 4.59e-21 J.

p_photon = E / c =4.59e-21 /3e8 = 1.53e-29 Ns.

Still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the change in angular momentum, but no, the question asks about the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me recheck that.

Mx =20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx My)/(Mx+My) = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 +3.321e-27).

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27= (3.321)^2 *1e-53= approx 11.03 *1e-53=1.103e-52.

Denominator:3.321e-26 +3.321e-27=3.321e-26*(1 + 0.1)=3.321e-26*1.1=3.653e-26.

μ=1.103e-52 /3.653e-26=3.017e-27 kg. Correct.

So I think all the calculations are correct, but the answer doesn't match any options. Which suggests that perhaps the question intended to ask for the vibrational transition, giving option D as the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the model used in the question considers only the vibrational energy, ignoring rotation. But the question says it's the rotation-vibration model, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition to the next state, which is a combination of vibrational and rotational, but that seems unclear.

Given the options, and my calculations, the only matching option is D:1.4e-28 Ns, which corresponds to the vibrational energy. So perhaps despite the rotational transition being lower, the question expects the answer to be based on the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me double-check.

Wait, I could have confused the rotational energy with the vibrational energy. Let me recheck the calculation for the vibrational photon's momentum.

E_vib = ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E /c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, and I was overcomplicating by considering the rotational transition.

But why would the question mention the rotation-vibration model if the answer is based on the vibrational transition alone?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the photon's energy causing the molecule to transition to a higher vibrational state, regardless of rotation, but I'm not certain.

In the absence of matching options for the rotational transition, and seeing that option D matches the vibrational transition, perhaps the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest vibrational and rotational states: \(v=0, J=0\)). The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options provided suggest that the photon's momentum corresponds to either a vibrational or rotational transition.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
     \]
     where:
     \[
     E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega, \quad E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1)
     \]
     Here, \(v\) is the vibrational quantum number, \(J\) is the rotational quantum number, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, \(\omega\) is the angular frequency of vibration, and \(B\) is the rotational constant.

2. **Fundamental State and Next State**:
   - The molecule starts in the fundamental state (\(v=0, J=0\)).
   - The next possible states are:
     - \(v=1, J=0\) (vibrational transition)
     - \(v=0, J=1\) (rotational transition)
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B
     \]

3. **Comparison of Transition Energies**:
   - The vibrational energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is calculated as:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad I = \mu r^2
     \]
     where \(\mu\) is the reduced mass and \(r\) is the bond length. Using \(\mu = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) and \(r = 2 \, \text{\AA} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), the moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.017 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
     Substituting into \(B\):
     \[
     B = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 (1.207 \times 10^{-46})} = 4.607 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
     The rotational energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.214 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - Comparing the two transitions:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.214 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Thus, the rotational transition requires less energy.

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
     \[
     p = \frac{E}{c}
     \]
     For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.214 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
     This value is significantly smaller than any of the provided options.

5. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
     This matches option **D**.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the rotational transition requires less energy, the calculated momentum for this transition does not match any of the options. The vibrational transition, on the other hand, corresponds to option **D** (\(p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)). Given the provided options, the intended answer appears to be based on the vibrational transition.
