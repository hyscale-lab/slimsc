Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the variance of an operator to the expectation value of its square minus the square of the expectation value. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but for that, I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because in that case, the expectation value of P_z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Or wait, no—actually, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue, so when you express the state as a linear combination, each coefficient squared gives the probability, and each component is multiplied by the eigenvalue.

Wait, let me clarify. The state vector is |ψ⟩, which is a column vector with components a, b, c. Since the basis is for P_z, each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z. So the possible eigenvalues are probably from the diagonal of the P_z matrix. Looking at the P_z matrix given:

P_z matrix is:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The basis vectors are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, corresponding to these eigenvalues.

The state is given as ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. So the components are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/sqrt(2), c3 = -1/2.

Wait, but the state must be normalized. Let me check: |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 + |c3|^2 should be 1.

Calculating each modulus squared:

|c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c2|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

|c3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4=1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by their eigenvalues. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|^2 * (ħ) + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (-ħ).

So substituting numbers:

(1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

But wait, that's only the first part. Now I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So P_z² has entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2) on the diagonal. So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is |c1|^2 * (ħ^2) + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (ħ^2).

Which would be (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So then the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = (1/2) ħ². So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly. Let me double-check the calculations.

⟨P_z⟩: 

c1 = -1/2 → |c1|^2 = 1/4 → eigenvalue ħ → 1/4 * ħ.

c3 = -1/2 → |c3|^2 = 1/4 → eigenvalue -ħ → 1/4 * (-ħ).

So 1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩:

Each term is |ci|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

Eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. Squared: ħ², 0, ħ².

So |c1|^2 * (ħ²) = (1/4) ħ².

|c3|^2 * (ħ²) = (1/4) ħ².

Sum: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So variance is (1/2) ħ², uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ → ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis vectors. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $| \psi \rangle$) and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $| \psi \rangle$ are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. Calculating $|c_i|^2$:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting into $\langle P_z \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the eigenvalues and probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
