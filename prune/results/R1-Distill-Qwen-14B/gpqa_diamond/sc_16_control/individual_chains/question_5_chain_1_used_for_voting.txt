Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the Pauli matrices are involved in representing the components of angular momentum. The operator P is made up of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components are given in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator P would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector n. Oh right, because any direction can be expressed as a combination of x, y, and z. But wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? So the operator along direction n would be P · n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so the eigenvalue equation would be P · n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So P · n is the operator, which is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down the components.

The given matrices are:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P · n = nx*(P_x) + nz*(P_z) ?

Wait, because n is in x-z plane, so ny = 0. So the operator becomes:

P · n = nx*(P_x) + nz*(P_z)

Let me compute that matrix. Let me denote the components:

nx and nz are direction cosines, so they satisfy nx² + nz² = 1.

So, substituting each P component:

P · n = (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The first term from P_x: off-diagonal terms are nx*(1) and nx*(1).
The second term from P_z: diagonal elements are nz*(1) and nz*(-1).

So matrix becomes:

[ [nz*(1), nx*(1) ],
  [nx*(1), nz*(-1)] ]

Multiply by ħ/2, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, the scaling factor (ħ/2) can be factored out. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no, actually, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation would be:

(P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But since the operator (P · n) includes the factors of ħ/2, perhaps I should factor that out. Or maybe I'll just work with the matrix inside without the ħ/2 factor, and then adjust the eigenvalue accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the matrix without the ħ/2 and set the eigenvalue as +1/2. Because the overall scaling can be adjusted. Let me think: let me define M = (P · n) / (ħ/2). Then the eigenvalue equation becomes M |ψ> = (1/2) |ψ>.

So M is:

M = [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Because (P ·n) = (ħ/2) * M. So M is the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

So now the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of M with eigenvalue 1/2.

Wait, no, because the equation is (P ·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → ( (ħ/2) M ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> / (ħ/2) → M |ψ> = (1) |ψ> / (1) → M |ψ> = (1/2) |ψ> ? Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me clarify. 

Wait, M is (P ·n) divided by (ħ/2), so M = (P ·n) * (2/ħ). Then the eigenvalue equation is (P ·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So substituting P·n = (ħ/2) M, we have:

(ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So M |ψ> = 1 * |ψ>. So we're looking for the eigenvector of M with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because M is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute the eigenvalues of M to be sure.

The matrix M is:
[ nz   nx ]
[ nx  -nz ]

The trace is nz + (-nz) = 0.

The determinant is (nz)(-nz) - (nx^2) = -nz² - nx². Since nx² + nz² = 1, determinant is -1.

So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ² - (trace) λ + determinant = 0 → λ² - 0 λ + (-1) = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So our eigenvalue is +1.

So we need to find the eigenvector for M with eigenvalue 1.

So the equation (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

M - I is:

[nz -1    nx      ]
[ nx      -nz -1 ]

So the equations are:

(nz - 1) ψ1 + nx ψ2 = 0

nx ψ1 + (-nz -1) ψ2 = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can write the first equation as (1 - nz) ψ1 = nx ψ2 → ψ2 = ( (1 - nz)/nx ) ψ1.

But wait, let's assume that nx is not zero, but if nx is zero, then we have a different scenario. Wait, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so nx can be zero. Hmm, but in the general case, nx is not zero. Let me proceed assuming nx ≠ 0.

So ψ2 = ( (1 - nz)/nx ) ψ1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ψ1, ( (1-nz)/nx ) ψ1 ].

To normalize, the sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

So |ψ1|^2 + | ( (1 - nz) / nx ) ψ1 |^2 = |ψ1|^2 [1 + ( (1 - nz)^2 ) / (nx^2) ) ] = 1.

Factor out |ψ1|^2:

|ψ1|^2 [ (nx^2 + (1-nz)^2 ) / nx^2 ) ] = 1.

So |ψ1| = sqrt( nx^2 / (nx^2 + (1 - nz)^2 ) )

But let me think about the denominator. Since nx^2 + nz^2 = 1 (because direction is unit vector), we can substitute.

Wait, nx^2 + nz^2 = 1 → nx^2 = 1 - nz^2.

So denominator in |ψ1|^2:

nx^2 + (1 - nz)^2 = (1 - nz^2) + (1 - 2nz + nz^2) ) 

= 1 - nz^2 + 1 - 2nz + nz^2 

= 2 - 2nz 

= 2(1 - nz).

So |ψ1| = sqrt( (1 - nz^2) / [2(1 - nz)] ) )

Wait, because nx^2 is 1 - nz^2.

So |ψ1| = sqrt( (1 - nz)(1 + nz) ) / sqrt( 2 (1 - nz) ) )

= sqrt( (1 + nz) / 2 )

So ψ1 = sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) * e^{iθ}, where θ is some phase.

Then ψ2 = ( (1 - nz) / nx ) ψ1.

Simplify:

(1 - nz) / nx → since nx^2 = 1 - nz^2 → nx = sqrt(1 - nz^2) (Assuming nx positive, but maybe not, but in any case, the sign can be taken care of by the phase.)

So substituting:

ψ2 = [ (1 - nz) / sqrt(1 - nz^2) ) ] * sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) e^{iθ }

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(1 - nz) / sqrt( (1 - nz)(1+nz) ) ) = sqrt( (1 - nz) ) / sqrt(1 + nz)

Because (1 - nz) / sqrt( (1 - nz)(1+nz) ) ) = sqrt( (1 - nz) ) / sqrt(1 + nz )

So ψ2 = [ sqrt( (1 - nz) ) / sqrt(1 + nz) ] * sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) e^{iθ }

Multiply the terms:

sqrt( (1 - nz) ) * sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) / sqrt(1 + nz )

= sqrt( (1 - nz) (1 + nz) ) / sqrt(2 (1 + nz) ) )

Wait, maybe I should do it step by step:

Let me compute the product:

( (1 - nz) / sqrt(1 - nz^2) ) * sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 )

Because ψ2 = [ (1 - nz) / nx ] * ψ1 → [ (1 - nz) / sqrt(1 - nz^2) ) ] * sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) e^{iθ}.

But 1 - nz^2 = (1 -nz)(1+ nz), so sqrt(1 - nz^2) ) = sqrt( (1-nz)(1+nz) ) = sqrt(1-nz) * sqrt(1+nz).

So [ (1 -nz) / sqrt( (1 -nz)(1 +nz) ) ) ] = sqrt( (1 -nz) ) / sqrt(1 +nz) ).

So ψ2 becomes [ sqrt( (1 -nz) ) / sqrt(1 +nz) ) ] * sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) e^{iθ}

Multiply the terms:

sqrt( (1 -nz) ) * sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) / sqrt(1 +nz )

= sqrt( (1 -nz) ) * sqrt(1 +nz) / sqrt(2 * (1 +nz)^2 ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me compute the product inside:

sqrt( (1 -nz) ) * sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) / sqrt(1 +nz )

= sqrt( (1-nz)(1+ nz) ) / sqrt(2 (1 +nz) ) )

= sqrt( (1 - nz^2) ) / sqrt( 2 (1 +nz) ) )

But 1 - nz^2 = (1 -nz)(1+ nz), so this is sqrt( (1 -nz)(1 +nz) ) ) divided by sqrt( 2 (1 +nz) ) )

That simplifies to sqrt( (1 -nz) / 2 ) ) because:

sqrt( (1 -nz) (1 +nz) ) / sqrt(2 (1 +nz) )

= sqrt( (1 -nz) (1 +nz) ) / [ sqrt(2) sqrt(1 +nz) ) ]

= sqrt( (1 -nz) ) * sqrt(1 +nz) ) / [ sqrt(2) sqrt(1 +nz) ) ]

= sqrt(1 -nz) ) / sqrt(2)

So ψ2 = sqrt( (1 -nz)/(2) ) e^{iθ}.

Hmm, so the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/(2) ) ,  sqrt( (1 -nz)/(2) ) ]^T multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this in terms of angles. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, which is the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So, nz = cosθ, nx = sinθ.

Wait, because if the direction is n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ ), but since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z would have θ as the polar angle from z-axis, so:

n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ )

But since it's in x-z plane, φ=0, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ ).

So, substituting:

nz = cosθ,

nx = sinθ.

So, let's plug these into the eigenvector components.

Eigenvector components:

ψ1 = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) e^{iθ}, 

ψ2 = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) e^{iθ}.

Wait, but wait, in our earlier substitution, for ψ1, the term was sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ), which is sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ), and ψ2 is sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ).

But wait, these look familiar. The expressions sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) are equal to cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), respectively.

Because:

cos^2(θ/2) = (1 + cosθ)/2 → cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 )

Similarly, sin^2(θ/2) = (1 - cosθ)/2 → sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

So, ψ1 = cos(θ/2) e^{iθ}, and ψ2 = sin(θ/2) e^{iθ}.

Wait, but wait, in our derivation, ψ2 was sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) e^{iθ}.

But let me think about the phase. When we set ψ2 = (1 -nz)/nx * ψ1, and considering that nx is sinθ, we have:

(1 - nz)/nx = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Which is ( (2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) / ( 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ) ) → ( sin(θ/2) ) / ( cos(θ/2) ) ) = tan(θ/2).

So ψ2 = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] ψ1.

Which, using the expressions in terms of θ/2, becomes [ (2 sin²(θ/2) ) / ( 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ) ] → tan(θ/2).

So ψ2 = tan(θ/2) ψ1.

Hmm, but in our earlier substitution, when we expressed ψ1 and ψ2 in terms of θ, we have:

ψ1 = cos(θ/2) e^{iθ},
ψ2 = sin(θ/2) e^{iθ}.

Wait, but wait, that would imply that ψ2 = ( sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) ψ1 ) → ψ2 = tan(θ/2) ψ1, which matches what we have. So yes, that's consistent.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Wait, but the eigenvector is a spinor, so it's a column vector. So the normalized eigenvector would be:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, multiplied by a phase factor e^{iθ}.

Wait, but in our case, the phase factor can be arbitrary, but perhaps it's taken as e^{iθ} because the direction in the x-z plane is at angle θ from the z-axis.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ). So that seems different.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have missed a normalization factor. Let me check.

Wait, when I substituted, the normalization factor for ψ1 was sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) which is cos(θ/2), and ψ2 is sin(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, that's similar, but why is there a e^{i phi} term?

Ah, because when I derived it, I have ψ2 = sin(theta/2) e^{i theta}, but when considering the direction in the x-z plane, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So perhaps the phase would not have e^{i phi}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the eigenvector components were derived as:

ψ1 = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) e^{iθ},
ψ2 = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) e^{iθ}.

Wait, why is there an e^{iθ} in both components? Because when solving for ψ2 in terms of ψ1, I got a ratio involving (1 -nz)/nx, which is (1 - cosθ)/sinθ, which is tan(theta/2), as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken into account the phase from nx. Because nx is sin(theta), and in the ratio (1 -nz)/nx, it's (1 - cos theta)/sin theta, which can be written as [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So the ratio is real and positive, assuming theta is between 0 and pi. So the phase factor would be 1, because the ratio is real and positive.

Wait, but in the derivation earlier, I thought ψ2 = (1 -nz)/nx * ψ1. If that ratio is real and positive, then ψ2 is a real multiple of ψ1, so the phase factors would be the same. So in that case, the eigenvector components would be real. So why do we have e^{i phi}?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the phase. Because the eigenvector is defined up to a phase, so perhaps the phase can be chosen as 1, making the components real. So the normalized eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ). But if the phase is arbitrary, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but with phi=0. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the eigenvector to be real, so it's option C with phi=0, but the option as written includes e^{i phi}.

Wait, but looking back at the multiple-choice options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, but in our case, the eigenvector is a column vector with components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C except for the phase. So option C includes a phase factor e^{i phi}, which is correct because the eigenvector can have any phase. However, in our case, the phase is 1 because the ratio (1 -nz)/nx is real and positive. But perhaps the question doesn't specify and the answer includes the general case with the phase.

Wait, but the question says that the direction is in the x-z plane. So phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero. So the phase factor e^{i phi} would be 1. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), which, with phi=0, matches. So option C is the correct choice.

Wait, but looking at option D: it has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by ħ. How did that come about?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, when multiplying the eigenvector by ħ, because the components P_x, etc., are given in terms of ħ/2. Wait, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is a vector in spinor space, and its components are dimensionless, except when multiplied by ħ.

Wait, no, wait. The operator components are given in terms of ħ/2, but the eigenvector itself is a unit vector. So perhaps the options with ħ as a factor are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine where ħ comes into play.

Wait, the operator P ·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix we used earlier. So when we found the eigenvector, it's a spinor, which is a unit vector. So the options with ħ (like option D) probably have a mistake, because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))

Option D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

So in option C, the components are dimensionless, which makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \right) \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we focus on the matrix:

\[
M = \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalues of $M$ are $\pm 1$, and we are interested in the eigenvalue $+1$. Solving the eigenvalue equation $(M - I)|\psi\rangle = 0$, we find the eigenvector components in terms of $n_x$ and $n_z$. Using the fact that $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, and substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the eigenvector components simplify to:

\[
\psi_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad \psi_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This matches the general form of option C, which includes an arbitrary phase factor $e^{i\phi}$ for the second component. Since the direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is zero, and the eigenvector simplifies to real components.

Option D introduces additional factors of $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$ multiplied by $\hbar$, which are inconsistent with the normalized eigenvector derived above. Similarly, options A and B do not match the derived form. Therefore, the correct answer is:
