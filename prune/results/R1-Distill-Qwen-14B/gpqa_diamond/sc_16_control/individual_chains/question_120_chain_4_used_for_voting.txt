Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being some inverse power of plx. 

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), I think. So if plx increases, distance decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. Oh wait, it's the number density in terms of plx. So it's like, for a given range of plx, how many stars are there? 

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their actual number density in space is constant. But when we project them onto the sky, which is what we observe, their distribution in terms of parallax changes because parallax depends on distance.

So, let's model this. Let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d+dd would be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars is proportional to 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d, right? So d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that. So d² becomes (1/plx)^2, and dd would be the change in d. But wait, since plx is 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, maybe I should consider the differential in plx.

Wait, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but I'm trying to express the number of stars in terms of plx. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = k * d² dd, where k is the constant of proportionality (since the star density is uniform).

But I want to express this in terms of plx. Let's substitute d = 1/plx. Then d² = 1/(plx)^2. And dd is the change in d, which in terms of plx is (from plx = 1/d), so d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but the number should be positive, so maybe I should take the absolute value. So, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, N = k * (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ). Wait, because dd is (1/plx^2) dplx. So putting it all together:

N = k * (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. That would be option A.

But wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d^2 * dd. So when we express this in terms of plx, which is 1/d, we have d = 1/plx, so d^2 = 1/plx^2. And dd is the change in d, which in terms of plx is (since plx = 1/d, so d plx = -1/d² dd). Hmm, I might be getting confused with the differentials.

Alternative approach: the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So in a volume element dV = 4πd² dd, the number of stars is n * dV, where n is the number density. 

But because we're observing the parallax, we need to consider how many stars fall into a given range of plx. Since plx = 1/d, a small change in plx dplx corresponds to a change in d of about dd = -d^2 dplx (because plx =1/d → d =1/plx → dd = - d^2 dplx ). 

So d = 1/plx → d^2 = 1/(plx)^2. So dd = -(1/(plx^2)) dplx.

So the volume element in terms of distance is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx^2) (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) dplx. The negative just indicates the direction of change, but we can take the absolute value for counting stars.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to (1/plx^2 ) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 1/plx^4 dplx.

Wait, so the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4. So that would mean the number density is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A. 

But wait, another way to think about it: the volume element in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, the volume element dV is 4π d² dd. Express d in terms of plx:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 dplx ) ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) dplx. Again, same result. So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4 per unit plx.

But wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)", so the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the volume element, we find \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Additionally, the change in distance \( dd \) can be expressed in terms of the change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \).

Substituting these into the volume element, we get:
\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 \, dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]
The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but for counting stars, we take the absolute value. Thus, the number of stars in a thin shell at a given parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx} \).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.
