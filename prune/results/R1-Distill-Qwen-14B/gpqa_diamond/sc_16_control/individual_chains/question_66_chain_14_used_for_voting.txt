Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT must respect them too.

First, Lorentz symmetry. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, right? So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincaré symmetry. So 2 is also correct. Wait, but wait — sometimes when you include higher-dimension operators, do they automatically respect Poincaré? I think yes because the SM operators do, and SMEFT extends it. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

CP symmetry— that's Charge conjugation and Parity. Wait, the SM respects CP symmetry, but some extensions (like certain beyond the SM theories) might not. But in SMEFT, are all operators required to respect CP? I think no. Because in SMEFT, you can have operators that explicitly violate CP, depending on the new physics. For example, some models have operators that are CP-odd. So 3 might not be a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry— that's a big one. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. I've heard that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way fields are treated and their antiparticles. So any operator in SMEFT, which respects Lorentz symmetry, must automatically respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it also respects Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct, but are they both required? Because Poincaré is a larger symmetry which includes Lorentz.

Wait, but the question says, which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Lorentz, does that automatically mean it respects Poincaré? Hmm, maybe not. Because Poincaré includes translations, which are about shifting the spacetime coordinates. So all the terms in the action must be invariant under translations. But when you write operators in SMEFT, each term is a local operator, but the coefficients are dimensionful (because they're higher-dimensional). Wait, but the action is the integral of the Lagrangian. So the action must be translationally invariant.

Wait, but when you have higher-dimensional terms, like (1/Lambda) (some operator), the action would have dimensions, right? But wait, the action in quantum field theory must be dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian must have a certain dimension. But regardless, the point is that the theory (the action) must be Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant.

So, operators must respect Poincaré symmetry because the action is built from local terms, and the theory must be Poincaré invariant. So 2 is correct.

So back to the options. The symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So the correct options are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. Option C includes 4.

Wait, but wait: do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CPT? Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT invariant, so any effective theory derived from it must also be CPT invariant. Because the underlying theory (SM plus new physics) must be CPT, but when you integrate out heavy fields, you get SMEFT. So SMEFT must respect CPT because the original theory does. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. Let us analyze the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT extends the Standard Model while maintaining Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures that the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian, remains invariant under spacetime translations.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CP symmetry, but SMEFT allows for operators that explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, and any effective theory derived from it must also respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is derived from the Standard Model, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
