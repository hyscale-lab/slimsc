Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what does 1-bromobenzene-2-d mean? Oh right, the "d" probably refers to a deuterium label. So the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium (D) at position 2. So the molecule looks like bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring.

Now, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic substitution reactions, especially with deuterated compounds, deuterium's presence can influence the mechanism, like in elimination or some substitution reactions.

Wait, but waitâ€”bromobenzene itself is an aromatic compound. When you have a substituent on the ring, the reactivity can change based on the directing groups. Bromine is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So, in typical electrophilic substitution reactions, the incoming group would add at the meta position relative to the bromine.

But the reaction here is with NaNH2 in ammonia. I'm thinking that NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but in what kind of reaction conditions? Oh, wait, NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a common condition used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, especially in aromatic systems. But wait, in aromatic systems, we don't really have elimination in the same way as aliphatic compounds. Or do we?

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of a benzyne intermediate. Because when you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dihalobenzene, treating it with a strong base can eliminate the two halides to form a triple bond, making benzyne (aryne). But wait, our starting material is 1-bromo-2-d. So, only one halide. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. That is, only one substituent: bromine at position 1 and deuterium at 2. So, the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2. But wait, that's not a dihalide. So can the base do anything with this?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, but where? Let me think about the structure: position 1 is bromine, position 2 is D. So, the adjacent positions are 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, no, the numbering may be different. Wait, 1-bromo-2-d benzene would have bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. So, the substituents are at adjacent positions.

In such a scenario, maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 2. Wait, but position 2 already has a D. Oh, but wait, the D is a deuterium atom; maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, but which one?

Alternatively, perhaps the base is involved in a elimination reaction, but that would require adjacent leaving groups or something. Wait, but bromobenzene doesn't have another leaving group adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bromine is a leaving group. So, in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups. Bromobenzene is deactivated, so nucleophilic substitution is not straightforward. But wait, with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps an elimination or some kind of substitution could occur.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond, but that would require adjacent halogens. Oh wait, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, but maybe the D is actually a hydrogen? No, wait, the question specifies 2-d, so it's a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me visualize the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3, etc. So, if position 1 is bromine (Br), position 2 is D (deuterium). Then, the adjacent positions are 3 and 6. Wait, but in that case, positions 3 and 6 are ortho to D, but maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 3 or 4.

Wait, but the base is NaNH2. So, it's a strong base and can abstract acidic protons. In aromatic systems, which protons are acidic? Typically, those that are ortho or para to deactivating groups. So, bromine is deactivating, so the protons meta to Br would be more acidic.

Wait, in bromobenzene, the acidic H's are at the meta positions relative to Br. So, if Br is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. But wait, in our case, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d. So, position 2 is D. So, position 3 is next to D. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the base will abstract a proton from position 3 or 4. Let me think. If the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, that could lead to the formation of a benzynelike intermediate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: maybe this is a case of a Fittig reaction or something similar, but that usually involves coupling of aryl halides, which doesn't seem to fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced. But since it's a benzene ring, which is aromatic, substitution would typically require a good leaving group and activating groups. But Br is a leaving group, but the ring is deactivated, so nucleophilic substitution may not proceed easily unless under certain conditions.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Could it deprotonate something and initiate a substitution? Maybe the base abstracts a proton, generating a carbanion intermediate.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton (maybe from position 3 or 4), leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge somewhere, which could then cause the bromine to leave, resulting in some kind of ring expansion or contraction? Or perhaps a coupling reaction.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the possible products. The question asks how many possible organic products there are.

If the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), but with only one substituent, I'm not sure that's possible. Because for benzyne formation, you usually need two leaving groups, adjacent to each other, so that elimination can form the triple bond.

Wait, but our starting material only has one Br. So, maybe the base can't form benzyne here. Hmm. So perhaps another pathway.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4 (which is para to Br), but I'm not sure. Let's think about the positions. Br is at position 1. D is at 2. So, position 3 is adjacent to D, position 4 is across from D, and position 5 is meta to Br.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to Br. Since Br is a deactivating group, position 4 would have an acidic H because it's meta to Br. No, wait, the acidic Hs are ortho and para to the deactivating group. Wait, Br is a meta director, but acidity is more about the stability of the conjugate base.

In bromobenzene, the H's in the ortho and para positions relative to Br are more acidic because when deprotonated, the negative charge can be delocalized into the ring through resonance. So, in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the acidic H's would be at positions 3 and 5, maybe.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let's imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1. The positions are as follows: position 1 (Br), position 2 (D), position 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the H's at position 3 (ortho to D, meta to Br) and position 5 (meta to Br, ortho to D) could be acidic.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 5, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at that position, leading to the elimination of Br-.

Wait, so if H is abstracted from position 3, the negative charge would be there, and then Br could leave as Br-, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. But wait, benzene is a 6-membered ring, so losing a Br and a H would form a 5-membered ring? But that doesn't make sense because the ring is aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps forming a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and can deprotonate compounds to form anions. In aromatic systems, especially with substituents that can stabilize negative charges, this could lead to various products.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could involve the deprotonation leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which could then undergo some kind of elimination, but with only one leaving group (Br), maybe it's a single elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to a adjacent H and Br, and then elimination of HBr, but that would require that the H and Br are antiperiplanar or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, Br is in position 1, D in 2.

When NaNH2 is added, it's a strong base. It can abstract a proton from the ring. The most acidic protons are those that are ortho or para to Br, but in our case, Br is at position 1, so the ortho positions are 2 and 6, and the para is 4.

But position 2 has a D, so the H is not present. So, maybe the H at position 6 (ortho to Br) is more acidic? Or position 4 (para to Br)?

Wait, but position 3 is meta to Br, and position 5 is also meta to Br. So, which is more acidic?

Wait, in bromobenzene, the acidity of the protons is as follows: the H's ortho and para to Br are more acidic because the conjugate base can delocalize the negative charge through resonance. So, in this case, position 6 is ortho to Br, so the H there is more acidic. Similarly, position 4 is para to Br, so the H there is more acidic.

So, the base (NaNH2) could abstract a proton from position 4 or position 6. But wait, in the starting material, position 2 is D, so perhaps the H at position 6 is present. So, the base would abstract that H, generating a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6.

Once the H is abstracted, the ring would have a negative charge at position 6, and since Br is at position 1, perhaps the Br could leave as Br-.

Wait, that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6, and the loss of Br-. But how would that affect the structure? Let me try to imagine that.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracting a proton leads to the formation of a benzene diradical or some intermediate that could undergo rearrangement.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about possible products. If the Br is replaced by something else, but in what way?

Wait, NaNH2 is also a source of NH2- ions. So, perhaps it can act as a nucleophile. But in aromatic substitution, nucleophilic substitution is difficult unless the ring is activated. But Br is a deactivating group, so maybe nucleophilic substitution is not favored.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, and then the Br leaves, resulting in a ring with a negative charge and a hole where Br was, leading to possible formation of a benzynelike structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that usually requires two adjacent leaving groups. So with only one Br, perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then undergo some kind of addition, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple elimination, removing Br and a proton to form a triple bond. But again, that would require two leaving groups adjacent, which we don't have here.

Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps the D at position 2 affects the mechanism. Because deuterium is a heavier isotope, it might have different reactivity, but I'm not sure how that would influence the product count.

Wait, another angle: in some elimination reactions, the base abstracts a proton, and the leaving group (like Br-) departs, forming a double bond. But in aromatic systems, forming a double bond would mean breaking the aromaticity, which is not favorable unless it's a very stable transition state or under forcing conditions.

Wait, but benzene is already fully conjugated with three double bonds. So, perhaps the elimination isn't feasible here.

Alternatively, the reaction could lead to the substitution of Br with an amide group or something from the ammonia. But for that, the ring would need to be activated. Since Br is deactivating, that's less likely, but maybe under strong basic conditions, something could happen.

Wait, maybe the bromide could be displaced by an amide ion. So, NaNH2 could provide NH2^- as a nucleophile, which attacks the aromatic ring. But again, the ring is deactivated, so nucleophilic substitution is unlikely unless there's a strong activating group, which isn't present here.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think about possible products.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br), then the ring would have a negative charge at 6, and Br would leave, leading to a ring contraction. Wait, but I don't see how that would happen. Alternatively, maybe the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond, but that would require another leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking. Maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the reaction with NaNH2 leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium in a different position. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to the formation of a carbanion, and then the bromide leaves, resulting in a benzene ring with a new substituent.

Wait, but without another substituent, maybe the ring would just lose Br and a H, but that would require forming a triple bond, which would need another substituent adjacent to Br.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible products. The question asks how many possible organic products are formed. The options are 4, 1, 2, or 3. So, probably the answer is one of these.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of only one product because the base abstracts a proton in a specific position, leading to a single product. Alternatively, maybe multiple products are possible.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. So, the base abstracts a proton (say, from position 2, but that's D, so not possible). Wait, but position 2 is D, so the base can't abstract a proton from there.

So, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 4, leading to the formation of benzyne. But without another halide adjacent, how would that work? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a proton from position 2, but position 2 is D. So that's not possible. So, the base would abstract from another position.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 3. Then, we have a negative charge there, and the Br leaves. But without another adjacent leaving group, perhaps the ring just forms a double bond, but that would break the aromaticity.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But again, without an activating group, I'm not sure.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe this is a case of a Benzoin condensation or some coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: maybe the NaNH2 is causing a elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond. But for that, the H and Br must be adjacent. So, in the starting material, Br is at position 1, D is at 2. So, the H is at position 2 is D, not H. So, the H's available are at positions 3,4,5,6.

Wait, to form benzyne, the H and Br must be on adjacent carbons. So, in our case, Br is at 1, so adjacent is 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so the only possibility is position 6. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, and Br leaves from position 1, that would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2? But position 2 is D, which is a different element. Wait, no, that's not possible because the base can't abstract a Dâ€”it abstracts H only.

Wait, maybe the H is at position 6. So, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, and the Br leaves from position 1, then we would have a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? But that's not adjacent. Wait, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent on the benzene ring, so that would be possible.

So, in that scenario, the reaction would eliminate H (from position 6) and Br (from position 1), forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Wait, no, position 2 is D, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon with Br at position 1, and D at position 2. So, position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, and Br leaves from position 1, then the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 6, but that's not adjacent. Wait, that can't form a triple bond because triple bonds require adjacent carbons. Oh, wait, position 1 and 6 are adjacent in a benzene ring. So, yes, they are next to each other. So, if Br is at 1 and H is at 6, their elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, making benzyne.

But then, the H at position 6 is being abstracted, and Br at 1 leaves. So, the resulting structure would have a triple bond between 1 and 2 (but position 2 is D), but that doesn't make sense because position 2 is D, not Br. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is next to Br at position 1. So, the elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, making a triple bond between adjacent carbons. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so yes, that would work.

So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6. But wait, that would require that the Br and H are on adjacent carbons. So, in this case, Br is at 1 and H is at 6, which are adjacent. So, eliminating H and Br would create a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but the starting material has D at position 2, so the H at position 6 is present. So, the base could abstract it, leading to the elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond. Then, that would form benzyne (aryne), which is a highly strained but reactive compound.

But wait, benzyne is a symmetric molecule, so regardless of where the triple bond forms, would that lead to different products? No, because the ring is symmetric. So, if the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, is that the same as between 2 and 3, etc.? Wait, in this specific case, the starting material has substituents at 1 and 2. So, if the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, the product would be 1,6-dideuteriobenzyne? Or would the D be in a specific position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let's think about it. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. After the reaction, the Br is eliminated, along with an H from position 6, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. The D remains at position 2, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6.

But wait, in the triple bond, the positions are 1 and 2? No, because position 2 is D. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is between positions 1 and 6, but the D is at position 2. So, the product would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, and a D at position 2. But would that be a possible structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a triple bond between positions 2 and 3. But in the starting material, position 2 is D and position 3 is H. So, if the base abstracts H from position 3, and Br leaves from position 1, the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 2 (but position 2 is D). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne. Maybe the elimination isn't possible, so the only product is the substitution of Br with something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the base doesn't induce any elimination but simply deprotonates the ring, leading to a carbanion. But then, what happens? Maybe the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a cyclopentadienyl anion, but that's not likely.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to the substitution of Br with an amide group. So, the NH2^- could attack the ring, displacing Br. But again, the ring is deactivated, so this is unlikely unless under very strong conditions.

But if that were the case, where would the substitution occur? The ring is meta directed, so the amide would add at the meta position relative to the D. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a rearrangement, leading to a different substitution pattern.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring. For example, removing Br and adding an NH2 group, but again, I'm not certain.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think about the possible products in terms of possible reaction outcomes.

If the reaction forms benzyne, the number of possible products would depend on the symmetry of the starting material. Since the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2, the positions of the substituents affect the possible products.

Wait, benzyne is symmetric, so the positions of the substituents would influence where the new substituents add. But in our case, if the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, and the D is at 2, then when the triple bond breaks, the addition could occur at positions leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps when the benzyne forms, it can react with other molecules or even itself. But the question is about the products formed from the reaction, so perhaps the main product is the benzyne itself, but that's an intermediate, not a final product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so no products are formed. But that's not an option here.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't form benzyne. Maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium and an amide group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But given the conditions, I'm not sure what that might be.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction leads to the formation of benzene with a D at position 2 and a new substituent at position 4, for example. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product because the base can only abstract a proton from a specific position, leading to only one possible product.

Wait, thinking about the positions again: Br is at 1, D at 2. The base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to Br. So, that's possible because position 4 has a H that's more acidic (para to Br). So, the abstracted H would be at position 4, leading to a negative charge there. Then, Br leaves, leading to a ring with a negative charge at position 4 and a triple bond between positions 1 and 2? But position 2 is D, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the Br leaves, and the negative charge moves around the ring. So, maybe the ring would have a negative charge at position 4, leading to some kind of aromatic rearrangement.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look up similar reactions to get an idea. But since I can't do that, I'll have to rely on my memory.

Wait, I remember that when o-dihalobenzenes are treated with a strong base like NaNH2, they eliminate to form benzyne. But in this case, we have only one halide. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any products, but the options don't include zero. Or maybe the reaction forms only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to a negative charge there, and Br leaves, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 3? But that's not adjacent, so triple bonds can't form between non-adjacent positions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the substitution of Br with an NH2 group, but under what conditions? That would require a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which is unlikely without activating groups.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a D at position 2 and a new substituent where the H was abstracted. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Since I'm not making progress, perhaps I should consider that the reaction leads to only one product. So, the answer would be option B) 1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to two products, depending on where the base abstracts the proton.

Wait, if the base can abstract a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br) and from position 4 (para to Br), then elimination could occur from either side, leading to different products. But in this case, would that result in different structures?

Wait, for example, abstracting from position 6 would lead to a triple bond between 1 and 6. Abstracting from position 4 would lead to a triple bond between 1 and 4. But wait, position 4 is across from Br, so would that form a triple bond? Or would the triple bond form between 1 and 4, which are across from each other but not adjacent. That can't form a triple bond because they're not adjacent.

Wait, so only position 6 is adjacent to Br, so the only possible elimination is from position 6. So, the base would abstract the H from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6. Thus, only one product is formed.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1. So the answer would be option B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base, and its role in this reaction is to abstract acidic protons from the aromatic ring, potentially leading to the formation of reactive intermediates.

In bromobenzene, the protons ortho and para to the bromine atom are more acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion. In this case, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. The acidic protons are located at positions 3 (meta to bromine) and 4 (para to bromine). However, the base cannot abstract the deuterium at position 2, as it is not a proton.

When the base abstracts a proton, it generates a carbanion intermediate. This intermediate can lead to the elimination of the bromine atom, forming a triple bond between the carbon where the proton was abstracted and the carbon where the bromine was originally attached. For this elimination to occur, the abstracted proton and the bromine must be on adjacent carbons. In this case, the only adjacent position to bromine at position 1 is position 6. Therefore, the base abstracts the proton at position 6, leading to the elimination of bromine and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in the formation of benzyne (aryne) with the deuterium remaining at position 2.

Since the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material allow for only one possible pathway to form benzyne, the number of possible organic products is 1.

Answer: B
