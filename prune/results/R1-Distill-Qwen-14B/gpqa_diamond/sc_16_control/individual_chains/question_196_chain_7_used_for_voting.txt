Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh wait, but since it's relativistic, we can't just use the classical equations of motion, right? So I need to consider relativistic effects here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, that's non-relativistic. But the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the right answer here.

But wait, the options include c, the speed of light, so relativistic effects are definitely in play. So I need to consider how relativity modifies the equations.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I should equate the potential energy to the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kA², right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, which is a non-relativistic concept. But in the relativistic scenario, the equation of motion would be more complicated. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total energy. In the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma * mc². But for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy would be the same as the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But wait, in the non-relativistic case, that's (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx², but in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy is treated differently. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I could think about energy conservation. At the point of maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum. So the total energy at x=A is (1/2)kA², and that's equal to the total energy at x=0, which is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, but relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So I set (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc². Wait, but (1/2)kA² is the non-relativistic potential energy. But in reality, in relativity, the potential energy might be different. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe in this problem, they still model the potential as (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy would be (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Let me write that equation:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Let me solve for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is also equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term. Let me compute the right side:

Right side: 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

Wait, but maybe I should instead write gamma as 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) and then find v_max from that.

Wait, let me call the factor (kA²)/(2 m c²) as S for simplicity.

So gamma = 1 + S.

Then, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + S).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + S)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + S)^2.

Let me compute that:

v²/c² = [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2.

Expanding (1 + S)^2 = 1 + 2S + S².

So numerator becomes (1 + 2S + S² - 1) = 2S + S².

So,

v²/c² = (2S + S²) / (1 + S)^2.

But S is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let me substitute that back in.

S = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² * (2S + S²) / (1 + S)^2.

Hmm, but that seems a bit messy. Let me try to factor this expression or see if it can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

2S + S² = S (2 + S).

Denominator is (1 + S)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ S (2 + S) ] / (1 + S)^2.

Let's expand S:

S = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

2 + S = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [4 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps I can write (1 + S) as [ (2 m c²) + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me plug S into (1 + S):

1 + S = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

So,

(1 + S)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ] / (2 m c²)^2.

So, putting it all together,

v² = c² * [ S (2 + S) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute this fraction:

The denominator is (1 + S)^2, which is ( [2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²) )^2.

So, the entire expression becomes:

v² = c² * [ S (2 + S) ] * [ (2 m c²)^2 / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ) ]

Let me compute each part.

S is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

S (2 + S) = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Which is (k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]

So,

S (2 + S) = [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c²)^2 ]

Putting it all together,

v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c²)^2 ) * [ (2 m c²)^2 / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ) ]

Wait, I think I can cancel terms here. The (2 m c²)^2 in the numerator and denominator will cancel.

So,

v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A². Not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor the denominator:

(2 m c² + k A²)^2 = [k A² + 2 m c²]^2.

Looking at the numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² ( (2 m c²)*2 + k A² )

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as k A² ( (k A²) + 4 m c² )

Wait, but maybe that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (k A² + 2 m c²)^2.

Hmm, I'm not seeing an obvious simplification. Maybe it's easier to let me think numerically. Let's say for large m, but probably not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach the problem from another angle. Since this is getting complicated, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the energy equation.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic case isn't (1/2)kA². Because when you go relativistic, the equations of motion for a harmonic oscillator change. Oh wait, the problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, but that's a non-relativistic concept. So perhaps in this problem, the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, which is relativistic.

So, (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

That gives gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let's call (k A²)/(2 m c²) = S.

So gamma = 1 + S.

Then, 1/gamma² = 1/(1 + S)^2.

Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so 1/gamma² = 1 - v²/c².

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(gamma)^2 ].

But gamma is 1 + S, so,

v^2 = c^2 [1 - 1/(1 + S)^2 ].

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + S)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + S)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2S + S²) - 1 = 2S + S².

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2S + S²)/(1 + S)^2.

Now, let's plug S = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) ] / [ (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Let me compute each part.

Compute numerator:

2S = 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

S² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

2S + S² = (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator:

(1 + S)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, but 1 + S = 1 + k A²/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

So, (1 + S)^2 = (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

Putting it all together,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator:

Numerator inside the brackets:

= [ (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Wait, because:

k A²/(m c²) = (4 m c^2 * k A² )/(4 m^2 c^4 )

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

Numerator bracket:

= (k A²/(m c²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

= [4 m c² * k A² + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Factor out k A²:

= [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c^2 * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) * (4 m² c^4) / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Wait, let me see:

The denominator in the fraction is (1 + S)^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ]^2.

So, the entire expression becomes:

v² = c² * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] * [ (2 m c^2)^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Because when you divide by (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2, it's equivalent to multiplying by (2 m c^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) * (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ] / [4 m² c^4 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Let me calculate all the constants and terms:

(2 m c^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4.

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A² (4 m c^2 + k A² )) * 4 m² c^4 ) ] / [4 m² c^4 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Notice the 4 m² c^4 in numerator and denominator cancel out.

So,

v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, okay, but I'm not seeing a simplification yet. Let me factor the numerator:

4 m c^2 + k A² = 2 * (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2.

Not helpful. Maybe let me factor out k A^2:

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A² = k A^2 ( 4 m c^2 / (k A^2) + 1 )

But that might not help either.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

v² = c^2 * [k A^2 (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Wait, let me write this as:

v^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 ( (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) ) ] / ( (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Which can be written as:

v^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 ( (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) ) ] / ( (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can rewrite the numerator as:

k A^2 (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) = (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) * (something)

Wait, let's see:

(k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) = (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

So,

k A^2 (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) = k A^2 [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ]

= k A^2 (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) from the numerator.

Wait, the numerator is k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ), and the denominator is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, let me factor (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 ( (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2.

= c^2 * [ k A^2 (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear path. Maybe instead, let me consider the expression for v^2 and see if I can write it in terms of (1 + S), where S is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, earlier I had:

v^2 = c^2 * (2S + S^2) / (1 + S)^2.

Let me factor 2S + S^2 as S (2 + S).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ S (2 + S) ] / (1 + S)^2.

But S = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so 2 + S = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [4 m c^2 + k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * ((4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ] / (1 + S)^2.

Wait, wait, but 1 + S is [2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 ), so (1 + S)^2 is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2/(2 m c^2 )^2 ) ]

Again, the (2 m c^2 )^2 terms cancel out.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, this seems to bring me back to where I was before.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + k A^2 )

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as:

k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Which is:

c^2 * [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 * k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

= c^2 * [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Let me separate the terms:

= c^2 * [ (k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 + (2 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

= c^2 * [ k A^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) + (2 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps that's a more manageable approach. Let me factor out k A^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait,

= c^2 * [ k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Which becomes,

= c^2 * [ k A^2 ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

= c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, same as before. So perhaps I should just accept that and take the square root.

Taking square root,

v_max = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator inside the sqrt:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 )

And the denominator is (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, wait, the numerator under the sqrt is k A^2 * (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ), so the square root would be A sqrt(k) * sqrt( k A^2 +4 m c^2 ).

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out k A^2 from the square root:

sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) = A sqrt(k) * sqrt( (k A^2) +4 m c^2 )

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe it's better to look for an expression that can match the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute the denominator inside:

1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) → But in our case, S is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so the denominator in option A is 1 - (k A^2)/(2m) which would be [2 m - k A^2 ]/(2 m). But in our case, the denominator is (1 + S )^2, which is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Looking at the options, perhaps option A isn't matching. Let's check option B:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute that expression.

The denominator is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) = (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

So,

1 + [ 2 m c^2 / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) ] = [ (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ] / ( 2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

Which is (4 m c^2 - k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

Then, sqrt( (4 m c^2 - k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) )

But that doesn't look like what I have for v_max. Hmm.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute this.

Denominator inside 1/(...) is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]^2

So,

1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 

Expanding numerator:

( (2 m c^2)^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2 ) - (2 m c^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4 = 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So,

1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ] = [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So, sqrt( 1 - ... ) becomes sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Which is sqrt( k² A^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

= A k sqrt(1 + (4 m c^2)/(k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, not sure if that matches our expression.

Wait, earlier, I had:

v_max = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Which simplifies to:

v_max = c * A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, not matching.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, so not the answer.

Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the energy conservation. Because in reality, the potential energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator might not be (1/2)kA². I think the problem says that it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, so perhaps the potential is treated as (1/2)kx², but the equations of motion are relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion is relativistic, which changes the dynamics.

Wait, the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator would involve the relativistic momentum. The force is F = -k x, so F = dp/dt = -k x.

Relativistic momentum p = gamma m v.

So,

d(gamma m v)/dt = -k x.

This is a more complicated differential equation, and solving it might give the correct expression for velocity.

But I'm not familiar with the solution to this equation, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the energy in terms of the relativistic equation.

Wait, the total energy E is given by gamma m c², which would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But in the oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², so at maximum displacement, the energy is (1/2)k A². At equilibrium, all of that energy is kinetic, which is (gamma -1 ) m c².

Wait, I think that's the approach I took earlier, leading to the expression for v_max.

So perhaps I should proceed with that approach.

Let me see, the expression I obtained for v_max is:

v_max = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Let me factor out k A^2 from the numerator inside the square root:

= c * sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= c * sqrt( k A^2 ) * sqrt(4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c A sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 2 m c^2 out of the numerator inside the square root.

Wait,

sqrt(4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) = sqrt( 2 m c^2 * 2 +k A^2 )

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) and the numerator as sqrt(k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )) = A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, maybe factor sqrt(k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = sqrt( (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 )

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator:

(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

So,

v_max = c A sqrt( k (2 m c^2 +k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Wait, wait, 4 m c^2 is 2 m c^2 *2, so:

k A^2 +4 m c^2 = (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

So,

sqrt( k ( (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k ( (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) +2 m c^2 ) )

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 2 m c^2 from under the square root:

k A^2 +4 m c^2 = 2 m c^2 ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

So,

sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k * 2 m c^2 ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

= sqrt( 2 m c^2 k ( 1 + S ) ), where S = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c * sqrt( [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] ) / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) = (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) * (something )

Let me think:

(k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) * (something ) = k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Let me compute (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) * (something ) equals the numerator.

Let me compute (k A^2 +2 m c^2 ) * something = k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Let me call 'something' as X.

So,

X = [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but that's not helpful. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the options and see which one can be rewritten in the same form as my expression.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D matches.

Wait, option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute this:

Denominator: (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So,

1/(1 + S)^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]^2.

So,

1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

The numerator expansion gives:

(4 m^2 c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4) -4 m^2 c^4 = 4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c * sqrt( k^2 A^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Factor k A^2 under the sqrt:

= c * A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Wait, that looks similar to my earlier expression.

Earlier, I had:

v_max = c * sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Which can be written as c * A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Which matches option D's expression.

Wait, because option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) )² )

Which, as I computed, becomes c * sqrt( [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Which is the same as what I have.

So, option D is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier when I derived the expression, I had:

v_max = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Which is the same as option D's expression.

So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is conserved, and at maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential, while at equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all energy is relativistic kinetic energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy at Maximum Displacement**:  
   The potential energy at \( x = A \) is \( V = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), assuming the potential energy is treated as non-relativistic.

2. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy at Equilibrium**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic, and the relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

3. **Energy Conservation**:  
   Equating the potential energy at \( x = A \) to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is also related to the velocity by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma \) into this expression and solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by **Option D**.
