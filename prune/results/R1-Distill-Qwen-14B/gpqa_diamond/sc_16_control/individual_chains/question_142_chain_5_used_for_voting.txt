Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this rho is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think the density matrix for a pure state |psi><psi| would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (squares to itself). But this rho is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probabilities. Because each term is |0><0| and |1><1|, which are projectors, and they're added together and multiplied by 1/2. So rho is actually a classical mixture of the two basis states. That makes it a completely mixed state, right?

Wait, in terms of the Bloch sphere representation, a pure state is on the surface, and a mixed state is inside. The Bloch vector for a qubit is represented as a point in 3D space (x,y,z). For a pure state |psi> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta)).

But in the case of a mixed state, how does that translate? Oh right, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). 

Wait, let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So for a general rho, it's (I + x σx + y σy + z σz)/2. So if I can compare the given rho to this form, I can find the Bloch vector (x, y, z).

The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of matrices. |0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [1 0; 0 0]. Similarly, |1><1| is [0 0; 0 1]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So rho = (I)/2.

Wait, so rho is I/2. Let's compare that to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. So (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2. So if rho is I/2, then (r·σ)/2 must be zero, so r·σ equals zero matrix. Which implies that r is the zero vector.

Because if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ is the sum of zero times each Pauli matrix, which is zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin in the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because a completely mixed state would be at the center, right? Because it's equally likely to be in |0> or |1>, so it's in the middle of the sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. This is a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) corresponds to the density matrix in the form 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form, we see that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), which implies that the Bloch vector \(r\) must be the zero vector \((0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is consistent with the completely mixed state being at the center of the sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**: Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
