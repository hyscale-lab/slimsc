Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I remember that ethynyl groups are triple bonds, so it's like a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl (C≡CH) substituent. I'm trying to figure out the structure of the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is also attached to another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So, the main chain might have a branch where a cyclohexyl group is connected via a CH(OH) group to a methyl group which is then connected to a carbonyl (aldehyde) group on a cyclohexane ring.

Let me think about the possible reactions and reagents that can achieve this transformation. I'm a bit rusty on some of the reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to recall.

The options given are four different sequences of reagents. I'll need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product.

Let me sketch out the structure step by step. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (let's call this compound A). The target molecule has a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl (CH(OH)-) group to another cyclohexane ring, which has a formyl (aldehyde) group.

Wait, maybe I should think about how to introduce the substituents. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne (C≡CH). The target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so perhaps some kind of cyclopropellane ring-opening or addition?

Another approach: Ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various reactions. One common reaction for alkynes is hydration. Using a catalyst, like HgSO4 and H2SO4 with water, can add water across the triple bond to form a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane (C≡CH attached to cyclohexane) would become cyclohexanone when reacted with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of an alkyne usually gives a ketone if it's a terminal alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) would upon hydration become C6H11-C(OH)CH3? Or maybe C6H11-C(OH)-H? No, wait. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) leads to the formation of an enol, which can tautomerize to form a ketone. So, for HC≡C-R, hydration would give R-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone. Wait, no. Wait, no, the triple bond is at the end. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with C≡CH, when hydrated, it should form cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Wait, no, wait: the general reaction is HC≡CR + H2O (with HgSO4 catalyst) → CH2(OH)CR. So for ethynylcyclohexane, which is C6H11-C≡CH, adding water would give C6H11-C(OH)-CH2H? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The triple bond in HC≡C-R would add water to give R-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, when you have HC≡C-R, the hydration gives R-C(OH)-CH3. So in this case, the R is cyclohexyl. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-ethynyl) would become cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH3? Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, perhaps better to think that adding water to ethynylcyclohexane would form cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Wait, but that's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne can be used in another reaction first before hydration.

Wait, another reaction that comes to mind is the alkyne undergoing deprotonation to form a strong base. NaNH2 is a common base used for deprotonating alkynes. So, using NaNH2 on ethynylcyclohexane would deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenyl lithium or something similar. Wait, no, NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide ion. So, ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 (a strong base) would give cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+).

But what's the next step with the acetylide? Acetylides can undergo alkylation. For example, if you have an acetylide and a methyl chloride, it would undergo alkylation to form a longer alkyne. So, cyclohexylacetylide plus methyl chloride would give cyclohexylpropargyl chloride? Wait, but methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So the acetylide (with a negative charge on the sp carbon) would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group. So the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+? Wait, no, perhaps it's cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^– ? Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure right. The acetylide is cyclohexyl-C≡C^– Na^+. When methyl chloride is added, it would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's a propargyl group: cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. The initial acetylide is cyclohexyl-C≡C^–. Adding a methyl group would make it cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3? But that's not possible because the triple bond can't have two substituents on the same carbon. Wait, what's the reaction of an acetylide with an alkyl halide?

Oh right, when an acetylide reacts with an alkyl halide, the acetylide (nucleophile) attacks the alkyl halide. So, for example, R-C≡C^- Na^+ + CH3X → R-C≡C-CH2X? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's R-C≡C^- + CH3X → R-C≡C-CH2X? Then, the X would be the leaving group, maybe. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide adds the alkyl group to the triple bond. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C^- plus CH3Cl would become cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, but that's a longer alkyne. Wait, but cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3 is a propargyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Hmm, maybe that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be used in a different way. For instance, after deprotonation to form the acetylide, maybe a coupling reaction occurs. Or perhaps the alkyne is used in a cyclopropane ring-opening. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to another cyclohexane with an aldehyde group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ring-opening of some sort, perhaps via a Grignard reagent or an organometallic reagent.

Wait, maybe the first step is to form a ketone from the ethynylcyclohexane. Using HgSO4 and H2SO4, H2O would add water across the triple bond, converting the alkyne into a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexylacetaldehyde. But wait, I thought that hydration of a terminal alkyne leads to a ketone, but maybe in this case, it would form an aldehyde. Wait, no. Wait, the reaction of ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) with HgSO4 and H2SO4, H2O would add a water molecule to the triple bond. The triple bond would become a carbonyl group. Wait, but adding water to a terminal alkyne typically gives an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. So for HC≡C-R, adding water gives R-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone. So, in this case, R is cyclohexyl, so the product would be cyclohexylpropanal or cyclohexylpropanone? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The triple bond is between two carbons. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached (like CH2-C≡CH but attached to the ring). Wait, no, the structure is more like:

       cyclohexane
       |
C≡CH (ethynyl group)

So, the triple bond is on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. No, wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is a triple bond. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH.

So the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Hydration of that would add water across the triple bond, making cyclohexyl-C(OH)-CH3, which would be a ketone. So that's cyclohexylacetone? Or more accurately, cyclohexylpropanone?

But the target molecule doesn't have a ketone. It has an aldehyde group. So maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent or something else.

Wait, another possibility: using NaNH2, which is a strong base, to deprotonate the alkyne, forming the acetylide. Then, perhaps alkylating it with a methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the triple bond. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C^- + CH3Cl → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or maybe cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the acetylide is on the terminal carbon. So adding a methyl group would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3, which is a longer alkyne, but perhaps that's not the right direction.

Alternatively, after deprotonation with NaNH2, perhaps a different reagent would add a group. For example, if you have an acetylide, you can add a methyl group via alkylation, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, looking at the options, each sequence starts with NaNH2 and some alkyl halide. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, so after NaNH2 and methyl chloride, the alkyne might have a methyl group added. Then, H2/Pd would hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. Let's think about that.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH), deprotonate with NaNH2 to form cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, add methyl chloride (CH3Cl), so the acetylide would attack, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that would form a longer alkyne, which is propargyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Then step 2 is H2 with Pd catalyst. Hydrogenation of the alkyne would add H2 across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Because the triple bond becomes a single bond with two H's added. Wait, no, Pd and H2 would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so the C≡C becomes CH2-CH2. So, the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's only possible if the triple bond is in the middle. Wait, no, the initial alkyne is at the end: for ethynylcyclohexane, it's cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation with methyl chloride, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that's a butyl group attached to cyclohexane. Hmm, but the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to another cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde.

That doesn't seem to line up. So maybe this sequence isn't the right one.

Looking at option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, making cyclohexylacetylide. Then, react with ethyl chloride. That would add an ethyl group to the alkyne, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, perhaps. Or it's used for elimination reactions. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is for deprotonating or for alkyne reductions. Wait, another thought: Li and NH3 can cause elimination reactions, perhaps forming allenes or other structures. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used in the reduction of esters or ketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's used for the formation of Grignard reagents.

Wait, but the next reagent is O3 (ozone) followed by H2O. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So perhaps the reaction involves forming a double bond.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck on how this would fit. Let me think about each step.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the triple bond, making a longer alkyne. Step 2: H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Then, ozonolysis would break any double bonds, but wait, after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. Wait, maybe I'm missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes elimination to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. So, perhaps the acetylide is formed and then quenched with methanol. Wait, but NaNH2 is used in deprotonation, and methanol would be a source of methyl groups. Hmm, perhaps this is for forming methyl esters, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to make the acetylide and then methylate it. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C^- + CH3OH → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, but I'm not certain.

I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group, which is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. And the same carbon (position 1) also has a formyl group (CHO). Wait, no, the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)) attached to a cyclohexyl group, and then attached to a cyclohexane that has a formyl group. Wait, perhaps it's a substituent on a cyclohexane ring, which has another cyclohexane ring attached via a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

cyclohexane ring A
|
CH(OH)-cyclohexane ring B
|
CHO

Wait, maybe it's a spiro compound or a bridged structure, but I'm not exactly sure.

But perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent to add a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a formyl group (aldehyde), which suggests that perhaps an oxidation step is involved. Alternatively, maybe a ketone is oxidized to an aldehyde, but I don't think that's possible directly. Alternatively, a hemiacetal or something similar is involved.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But oxidation of secondary alcohols gives ketones, not aldehydes. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed via a Grignard addition. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane.

2. Deprotonate with NaNH2 to form an acetylide.

3. Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

4. Hydrogenate the alkyne to form a trans-alkane or a single bond.

Wait, but that doesn't directly lead to the target structure.

Another thought: The alkyne could be converted into a ketone via hydration, but then how to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent is added, and then further reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated first to form an alkane, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps the key is to form a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, maybe the synthesis involves forming a new carbon-carbon bond, such as through a Grignard or organometallic reagent.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclopropane derivative. For example, using a Simmons-Smith reaction to add a carbene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cyclopropyl group via some cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the target molecule can be thought of as having a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane, and then an aldehyde group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridge between two cyclohexane rings via a hydroxymethyl group, and then introducing the aldehyde.

But how?

Let me think about each option again, step by step.

Option A:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms the acetylide and methylates it, so the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? Then, step 2 is H2/Pd: which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached to cyclohexane. So, after step 2, we have a butyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Then step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but more commonly it's used for the oxidation of ketones to diketones or for the elimination of water to form alkenes. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but after step 2, the molecule is a butylcyclohexane. Adding Ba(OH)2 would require an alcohol or some functional group to eliminate. So, perhaps step 3 is not applicable here, unless I'm missing something.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the hydration catalyst for alkynes. But if the alkyne was already hydrogenated, this won't do anything. So, perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: forms the acetylide and adds ethyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps this is for deprotonation or for reductions. Wait, Li in NH3 is a strong base and can cause elimination. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but ethynylcyclohexane is not aromatic.

3. O3 followed by H2O: ozonolysis would cleave double bonds. But where would the double bond come from? Maybe step 2 forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, forming an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to visualize:

After step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Maybe this induces elimination, converting the alkyne into a triple bond and a double bond? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne becomes a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a cis-alkene with Li in NH3. Wait, I'm not certain about the reaction conditions here.

After that, ozonolysis would break any double bonds. So, if there's a double bond in the molecule, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH (step 4) would work as a reductive workup, perhaps.

But this seems a bit unclear. I'm not confident about this option.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms the acetylide and adds methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane.

So, after step 2, we have a pentyl group (cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3).

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds, but after step 2, the molecule is a single bond. Unless step 2 leaves a double bond, which I don't think it does. So perhaps this step isn't applicable, unless I'm missing something.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2. Again, Ba(OH)2 is for elimination or oxidation, but not sure.

I'm not sure this is the right path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: forms the acetylide, then methanol may act as an acid quench or as a methylating agent.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. When you deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, you get the acetylide. Then, if you add methanol, perhaps it protonates the acetylide, giving back the alkyne. But methanol is also a methylating agent. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide reacts with methanol in some way, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to form a Grignard reagent. Wait, NaNH2 is used in deprotonation to form acetylides, not Grignards. Grignard reagents are formed with Mg in ether.

Hmm, I'm not sure about this.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is to form the acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. So, cyclohexylacetylide + CH3OH → cyclohexylacetaldehyde? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol as a methylating agent, giving cyclohexylpropargyl methyl ether, but I'm not certain.

Then, step 2 is Li in liq NH3. Perhaps this is for elimination, forming a double bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which might be for workup.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target molecule.

Wait, maybe another approach: The target molecule's structure suggests that there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring, and that carbon also has an aldehyde group.

So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, which is then oxidized to form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe it involves forming a Grignard reagent that adds to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule can be thought of as a product of a conjugate addition. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to some additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard reagent adds to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the Grignard reagent is cyclohexyl magnesium bromide, adding to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but let's think about the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is hydrated to form cyclohexylacetophenone? No, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) upon hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4, H2O would form cyclohexylpropanal (if it's an aldehyde) or cyclohexylpropanone (if it's a ketone). Wait, I'm confused again.

Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡CR) gives R-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) would become cyclohexylpropanone: O=C(CH3)-cyclohexyl. Wait, no, the numbering would be different. It would be (cyclohexyl)propan-2-one, I think.

So, cyclohexylpropan-2-one.

Then, adding a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) would add to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps oxidation of that alcohol would give a ketone again, but I need an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group in such a way that upon oxidation, an aldehyde is formed.

Wait, another possibility: The Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl, forming an alcohol, and then the alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde. But oxidation of secondary alcohols gives ketones, not aldehydes. So that's a problem.

Unless the alcohol is primary. So, perhaps the ketone is first converted into an aldehyde, but that doesn't make sense because ketones can't be directly oxidized to aldehydes.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then protected in some way and further functionalized.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group to another cyclohexane with an aldehyde. So, perhaps the aldehyde is from a formyl group that was introduced via a Grignard reaction with formaldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, which upon oxidation would form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with O3), followed by some steps to form the aldehyde.

But I'm getting stuck.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Let me walk through option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group, so the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (if the starting material is cyclohexyl-C≡CH, after alkylation, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the alkylation would add a methyl group, making it cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the structure correctly.

Wait, the starting material is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives the acetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^– Na^+. Reacting with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the structure becomes cyclohexylpropargyl group: cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the original structure was cyclohexyl-C≡CH. After deprotonating and adding methyl chloride, it becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's a propyne group: prop-1-yne attached to cyclohexane.

Then, step 2: H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (CH2-CH2). So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a butyl group attached to cyclohexane).

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. But after hydrogenation, the molecule is a single bond. So perhaps this step won't do anything unless there's a double bond formed elsewhere. But I don't see where the double bond would come from.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond but instead does something else. Wait, H2 with Pd is for hydrogenation, so it should reduce the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step that forms a double bond before ozonolysis. But option C doesn't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is for something else. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would break the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones. But without a double bond, this wouldn't work.

So maybe option C isn't the right path.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: forms the acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. Maybe this leads to cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

Wait, when you add methanol to an acetylide, perhaps it forms an alkyne with a methyl ether. Or, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a ketone. Not sure.

Then, step 2: Li in liq NH3: maybe this is for deprotonation or for elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds.

Step 4: NH4OH: perhaps a workup.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Wait, another angle: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized or further functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, but that's usually done with OsO4, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are the ones that first form a cyclohexyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenate, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and finally form the aldehyde.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the presence of Ba(OH)2 and HgSO4 in the options.

Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, but more commonly, it's used in elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alcohols. It's also used in the E2 elimination.

HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O are used as catalysts for the hydration of alkynes to ketones.

In the target molecule, the aldehyde is present, which suggests that perhaps a secondary alcohol was oxidized. But oxidation of secondary alcohols gives ketones, not aldehydes. So that's confusing.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the target is formed via a benzoin condensation or some other cross-aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C. Here's why:

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms cyclohexylpropargyl chloride.

Wait, no, NaNH2 and methyl chloride with the acetylide would give cyclohexylpropargyl methyl ether? Not sure.

Then, step 2: H2 with Pd-CaCO3: hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making a butyl group.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S: but without a double bond, nothing happens.

Hmm, not making sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the target structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring, and the same carbon has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a spiro compound, where two cyclohexane rings are connected via a single carbon, which has both the hydroxymethyl group and the aldehyde group.

Wait, but that would imply a carbon with four bonds: two from the cyclohexane rings, one hydroxymethyl, and one aldehyde. That's not possible. So perhaps it's a branching point.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

cyclohexane ring A
|
C(OH)(cyclohexane ring B)(CHO)

So, the carbon at position 1 of ring A has a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)) connected to ring B, and also has a formyl group (CHO).

So, this suggests that the carbon has three substituents: two from the cyclohexane rings (maybe as a bridge), a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is formed via a crossed aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents involve the formation of a cyclopropane, which then undergoes ring-opening to form the desired structure.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another cyclohexane with a CHO group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the two cyclohexane rings via a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But how to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, here's a possible pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is converted into cyclohexylacetophenone (a ketone) via hydration.

2. Then, a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) is added to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol.

3. The secondary alcohol is then oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't give an aldehyde.

Hmm, no good.

Another approach: The target has a formyl group. Maybe the aldehyde is formed via the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a primary alcohol which is then oxidized.

But to form a primary alcohol from a ketone, you'd need a reduction, but that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: forms the acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. Maybe this gives cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

Wait, but how? Acetylide plus methanol: R-C≡C^- + CH3OH → R-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Then, step 2: Li in liq NH3. Perhaps this reduces the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

If the structure after step 2 is a cis-alkene (cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-cyclohexane?), ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes or ketones.

Then, step 4: NH4OH would work up the ozonides, forming carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C:

After hydrogenation, the molecule is a butyl group. Ozonolysis wouldn't do anything, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, another option: Maybe the correct sequence is option B.

Option B steps:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: forms the acetylide and adds an ethyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. Li in liq NH3: perhaps this reduces the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. O3 and H2O: ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: workup.

So, let's think: After step 1, the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe this reduces the triple bond to a cis double bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Or perhaps it's a different transformation.

Wait, maybe Li in NH3 induces a 1,2-reduction of the alkyne to an alkene. So, the alkyne becomes a cis-alkene.

So, after step 2, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, like cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3 after step 2.

Then, step 3: O3 followed by H2O. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO and another aldehyde or ketone.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target molecule.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products of each option and see which one matches the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let's go through it again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms cyclohexylpropargyl methyl ether? Or perhaps a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3: hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond. So, the alkyne becomes a single bond, making a butyl group attached to cyclohexane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis, but without a double bond, nothing happens.

So, this sequence doesn't seem to produce the target.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: forms the acetylide, which is quenched with methanol. Maybe this gives cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

2. Li in liq NH3: perhaps this reduces the aldehyde to a primary alcohol.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis, but again, no double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is option A:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms a methylated acetylide.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates to a single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps this is for elimination, forming a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration of the alkyne to a ketone.

Wait, but after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated. So step 3, Ba(OH)2 would require an alcohol or another functional group. Unless step 2 leaves a diol or something.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a diol, but that doesn't fit.

Another approach: Let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, maybe the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent that adds to a carbonyl group, then forming a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but the target has two cyclohexane rings connected via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps a coupling reaction is involved.

Wait, another possibility: The alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard reagent adds to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, oxidation would form a ketone again, but we need an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the Grignard reagent adds to a different carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a conjugate addition of a Grignard reagent to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, option C's steps:

After step 1, the alkyne is longer. Step 2 hydrogenates it to a single bond. Step 3 is ozonolysis, which can't act unless a double bond is present. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is a diol. For example, if the hydrogenation isn't complete and leaves a diol, but I don't think so. Or perhaps step 3 is a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which is a product of an oxidation. So, perhaps the correct sequence includes a step where an aldehyde is formed.

Looking at the options:

Option C, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which isn't directly linked to forming an aldehyde.

Option D, step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide. That could be a workup after ozonolysis, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form an acetylide.

2. Alkylate it with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer alkyl chain.

4. Ozonolysis, but without a double bond, nothing happens. So that can't be it.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Here's why:

After step 1, the alkyne is extended. Step 2 hydrogenates it to a single bond, giving a longer chain. Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in step 4 is for forming a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the correct sequence is option C because it includes ozonolysis, which could form aldehyde groups.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps I'm missing a step that forms a double bond before ozonolysis.

Wait, looking again, option C's step 3 is O3/ (CH3)2S. So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

How could step 2 form a double bond? H2/Pd is for hydrogenation, not for forming double bonds.

Wait, another thought: Maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that forms a cis-alkene. No, hydrogenation adds H2 across a double or triple bond, reducing it, not forming it.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D. Let me think:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. Maybe this gives cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Perhaps this is for deprotonating to form a strong base, then quenching to form a Grignard-like addition.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is for Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic compounds.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds.

Step 4: NH4OH. Workup.

Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis won't act.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to think of each option's possible products.

Option A:

After step 1: cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenate to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe elimination forms a double bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? If so, then step 4: hydration, which would add water to the triple bond, but there's no triple bond. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for epoxidation, but that's not likely.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let me think about each reagent's purpose.

NaNH2 is used for deprotonating alkynes to form acetylides.

Methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group.

H2 with Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from alcohols.

HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O are for hydrating alkynes to ketones.

O3 is for ozonolysis of alkenes.

(CH3)2S is a reductive workup after ozonolysis.

NH4OH is a mild acid workup.

So, considering the target structure, which has an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached via hydroxymethyl, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Forming a ketone from the alkyne via hydration.

2. Adding a Grignard reagent to the ketone to form a secondary alcohol.

3. Oxidizing the secondary alcohol to a ketone again, but that doesn't help with the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.

2. Alkylate the acetylide to form a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to form a single bond.

4. Oxidize to form a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps option C is the correct answer because after ozonolysis and workup, aldehyde groups are formed. Let me think:

Option C:

After step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenate to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, nothing happens.

Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility: After step 2, the molecule is a longer alkane, which is then ozonolyzed, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a different reaction. Wait, ozonolysis is for cleavage of double bonds. So unless step 2 leaves a double bond, which it doesn't, this step won't do anything.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the presence of Ba(OH)2 and HgSO4, which are for elimination and hydration, option C seems plausible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests that an alcohol was formed. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming an alcohol and then oxidizing it. But oxidation of secondary alcohols gives ketones, not aldehydes. So perhaps the alcohol is primary, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Form an alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to a single bond.

3. Form an alcohol.

4. Oxidize to aldehyde.

But I'm not sure which option fits.

Wait, another thought: The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the carbon has a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde. That carbon must be adjacent to two cyclohexane rings. So, perhaps it's a result of a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group, followed by oxidation.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with option C as the correct answer, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring and an aldehyde group on the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then alkylated with methyl chloride, resulting in a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a butyl group attached to cyclohexane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination, but the product after hydrogenation does not have the necessary functional groups for this step.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration reagents, but the alkyne has already been hydrogenated, so this step is ineffective.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the product after step 2 is unclear.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

This sequence does not produce the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with methyl chloride, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a butyl group attached to cyclohexane.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the product after step 2 is a single bond, so this step is ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Used for elimination or oxidation, but the product does not match the target molecule.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, and methanol may quench the acetylide or act as a methylating agent, potentially forming an aldehyde or ether.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the product after step 2 is ambiguous.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

This sequence does not produce the desired product.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly leads to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary functional groups, even though the reasoning is incomplete.
