Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I've studied some differential geometry before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's written in terms of x and y, so I'm guessing this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? So this is a 2D spacetime? No, wait, pseudosphere—so maybe it's a 2D surface? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature. But let's focus on the metric.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, which suggests it's a coordinate system. But what kind of surface does this describe? Let me see. The coefficient of dx² and dy² is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). So that's a function of x² + y². So maybe this is a radial coordinate system where r² = x² + y².

Hmm, so perhaps this is a 2D metric where the line element is scaled by this factor. To find the area, I think I need to compute the area element dA. In 2D, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal, right? Because it's written as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a scalar function. So the metric tensor components g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y², and g_xy and g_yx are zero. So the determinant of this metric is [32/(4 - r²)]². But wait, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy, which in this case is just sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy since g_xy is zero. So that would be sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) dx dy. The square root of (32/(4 - r²)) squared is just 32/(4 - r²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, the question says radius r=2. So what's the pseudosphere's area? I remember that the area of a sphere in Euclidean space is 4πr², but a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, so its area is different. Oh wait, wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the area can be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps this metric is in a different context.

Wait, maybe I should look at the given metric and see what kind of surface it describes. Let me think about the line element:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

If I let r² = x² + y², then the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr², but wait, no, because the original metric is in terms of dx and dy, not dr. So perhaps I should change to polar coordinates (r, θ). Let me try that. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². Substituting that into the metric:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] [dr² + r² dθ²]

So now the metric is in terms of r and θ. This looks like a metric in polar coordinates. Now, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ²) dr dθ. Since the metric is diagonal, g_rθ = 0. So the area element is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ.

Calculating each component:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * r²

Wait, no, actually, in the metric ds² = A dr² + B r² dθ², so g_rr is A, and g_θθ is B r²? Wait, no, in standard polar coordinates, g_θθ is B, but here, when you have ds² = A dr² + B dθ², but in our case, it's [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ². So:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = [32 r²]/(4 - r²)

So the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = [32^2 r²]/(4 - r²)^2.

Taking the square root, the area element dA is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ = [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait, wait, sqrt( (32/(4-r²)) * (32 r²/(4-r²)) ) = sqrt( (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = (32 r) / (4 - r²).

So dA = [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait, what's the radius here? Oh, wait, pseudospheres in hyperbolic geometry have a certain radius, but I'm not entirely sure how this metric relates to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is a 2-dimensional surface, and the given metric is a representation of it. The area would be an integral over the entire surface.

Wait, but the metric's denominator is (4 - r²), which suggests that r² <4; otherwise, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would cause the metric to blow up or become imaginary. So the maximum r is 2. So the surface is defined for r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So to compute the area, I would integrate dA over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π.

Let me compute the area A:

A = ∫ (θ: 0 to 2π) ∫ (r: 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Because dA = [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So, first integrate over θ:

The integral over θ is ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫32 r dr/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ]

= 32 ∫ ( - du/(2 u) ), since r dr is (-du/2)

Wait, let me adjust the substitution correctly.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So ∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = ∫ [32/(u)] * (r dr) = ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ) = ∫ (-16) (1/u) du.

So, the integral becomes -16 ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ln|u| + C.

Now, evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=0; at r=0, u=4.

So the definite integral is [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm, but wait, when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

-16 [ ln(u) ] evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

Which is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so ln(0) is negative infinity, making the expression [ (-infinity) - ln(4) ].

So, the integral becomes -16 [ (-infinite) - ln(4) ) ].

Wait, but hold on, this would be -16 [ ( -infty ) - ln4 ) ] = -16 [ -infty + ... ] = positive infinity. Because as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So when you evaluate from u=4 to u=0, it's ln(0) (which is -infty) minus ln(4), so the entire expression would be (-infty - ln4), which is -infty. Then multiply by -16:

-16 * (-infty - ln4) = 16*(infty + ln4) = +infty.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the area is infinite. But the options include option D) +infty. So is that the case?

But wait, the radius of the pseudosphere is r=2. So perhaps the metric is only defined up to r=2, and the area is finite. But according to this calculation, the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area. That would imply the area is infinite, so the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But why would the area be infinite? Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or the integral.

Wait, let me recheck the substitution.

The integral is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ].

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=4-4=0. At r=0: u=4.

So:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → -16 * (-infty - ln4) → 16 (infty + ln4) → +infty.

Hmm, so the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, pseudospheres have finite area in hyperbolic geometry. Oh, wait, maybe I'm confusing 2D and 3D. Wait, a pseudosphere is a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, so in 2D, the area is finite. But according to this metric, the area seems to be infinite. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Another thought: perhaps this metric isn't for a pseudosphere but for something else. Let me check the metric again.

Wait, another approach: the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about this in terms of differential geometry. The line element is conformally flat, meaning it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. So the scalar factor here is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

The area element would then be [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, as I found earlier.

Wait, but wait, my integral was ∫∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ from r=0 to 2 and θ=0 to 2π. So that's 32 ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr * ∫0^{2π} dθ.

But the radial integral is ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral again. Let me substitute u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 = ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

= (1/2) ∫ [ du/u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, because the substitution gives r dr = -du/2, so the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-du/2)/u.

So, ∫ [ (-1/(2u) ) du ] from 4 → 0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u du) = (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) → (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) → (-1/2)(-infty) → positive infinity.

So the radial integral diverges. Therefore, the area is infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. In hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is not representing a pseudosphere but some other surface.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Gaussian curvature. For a metric in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be computed, and for a pseudosphere, it's constant and negative. Let me try to compute the curvature quickly.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in isothermal coordinates (where the metric is λ²(dx² + dy²)) is (1/(2λ)) Δ(ln λ), where Δ is the Laplacian.

In this case, λ² = 32/(4 - r²) where r² = x² + y². So λ = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Compute ln λ = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

Compute the Laplacian in 2D polar coordinates, which for a function f(r), is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

So df/dr = (1/2) [ 0 - ( -2r )/(4 - r²) ) ] = (1/2)(2r/(4 - r²)) )= r/(4 - r²).

Wait, wait, let me compute:

f(r) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

df/dr = 0 - (1/2)( -2r/(4 - r²) ) ) = (r)/(4 - r²).

Then, d/dr (r df/dr) = d/dr [ r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) ].

= d/dr [ (r²)/(4 - r²) ) ]

= [ (2r)(4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ 8r - 2r^3 + 2 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2

= 8r / (4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian Δ(f) = (1/r) * (8r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, K = (1/(2λ)) * Δ(ln λ) → Wait, no, the formula is K = (1/(2λ)) * Δ(ln λ).

Wait, let me be precise. The formula for Gaussian curvature K in isothermal coordinates (ds² = λ²(dx² + dy²)) is:

K = - (1/(2λ²)) Δ(ln λ).

Wait, no, I think I might have messed up the formula. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here, and perhaps it's better to think that since the area is infinite, the given metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere but perhaps a different surface, or perhaps the pseudosphere is embedded in a 3D space but the metric is 2D, leading to an infinite area.

Given the options, the only options with +infty is D. So the correct answer would be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we first convert the metric to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). In polar coordinates, the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in 2D is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) and \(g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\). Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the domain of the surface. The surface is defined for \(r\) in the range \([0, 2]\) (since the denominator \(4 - r^2\) becomes zero at \(r = 2\)) and \(\theta\) in \([0, 2\pi)\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln|u| \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This means the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
