Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses that product with reagent B (and H2O) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the structures right. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When ketones react with NaCN, I remember that they typically undergo nucleophilic addition. So the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon.

In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The nitrile group is at the end, so the structure is CH2-C(CN)(OH)-CH2- something? Wait, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN adds, it would add CN- and H2O or maybe something else.

Wait, but wait. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in the presence of something acidic, like H3O+, it might protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation! So the reaction is ketone + CN- in acidic conditions to form a cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, reagent A would be something acidic, like H3O+ (since NaCN is a weak base, so adding H3O+ would provide the H+ needed to protonate the carbonyl). That makes sense. So A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The product from the first step is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Hmm, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, I think that the first reaction's product is the nitrile, and the second step is treating that with reagent B and water to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I think that's typically done through hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. But wait, under acidic conditions, the reaction would use H3O+ and heat. Or maybe in the presence of a strong acid like HCl.

So the second reaction is converting the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Let me think about the reagents. For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, one common method is using strong acid and water. Another is using a strong base, but that usually gives a carboxylate, which would then need acid work-up.

But in the given reaction, reagent B is in the presence of H2O. So the reagent could be something that provides H+ ions, like HCl. Because when you add H2O and an acid like HCl, the nitrile would undergo hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The first reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Since the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which needs an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or maybe H2SO4, but H3O+ is a source of H+.

Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option D says A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B), or NaHSO3 (options C or D). NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, when would you use that? Hmm, perhaps when the reaction is under more controlled conditions, or maybe in a different type of reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is not a simple acid-catalyzed cyanohydrin formation. Could it be something else? Or perhaps it's a different kind of addition.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and adding NaCN in presence of H3O+ would definitely form the cyanohydrin. So A must be an acid, so H3O+ is correct. So options A or B, since those are the ones with A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The product is a carboxylic acid. To convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you can use strong acid hydrolysis, like HCl in H2O and heat. In that case, B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option D has B as HCl as well? No, let me check.

Options:
A) A=H3O+, B=HCl
B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
D) A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So option A's B is HCl, which would fit the hydrolysis. So for the second step, reagent B is HCl, used in water. So the second reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait a moment. The product of the second reaction is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The reagents would need to provide the H+ for the hydrolysis. So using HCl (a strong acid) makes sense.

So putting it together, reagent A should be H3O+ and reagent B should be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure. Could reagent B be something else? For example, using acetic acid (CH3COOH) as a weak acid might not be enough. Because nitrile hydrolysis typically requires a strong acid like HCl. Or maybe in some cases, if using a weak acid but under high temperature and pressure, but I think HCl is more common.

So the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Which is option A.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. This reaction requires an acidic catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary H⁺ ions. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This hydrolysis typically requires a strong acid, such as HCl, to facilitate the reaction. While weak acids like CH₃COOH (acetic acid) can sometimes be used, they are less effective for this transformation compared to strong acids like HCl. Thus, reagent B must be HCl.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option A.
