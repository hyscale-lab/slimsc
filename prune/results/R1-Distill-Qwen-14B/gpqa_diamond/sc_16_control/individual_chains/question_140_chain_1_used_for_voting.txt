Okay, so I've got this science problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and another product B. I need to figure out what these substances are based on the clues given.

Let me break down the information:

1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Its reaction with Y is violent, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, so W's molecule must be a noble gas because noble gases are chemically inert and have balanced protons and neutrons in their outer shells. Wait, protons and neutrons in a molecule? Wait, no—each molecule's atoms must have same number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe it's for the molecule as a whole. Wait, the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That might mean each atom has an equal number, making it a noble gas atom. Because for noble gases, the number of protons equals the number of electrons, but neutrons are a bit more, but wait—each noble gas atom has a specific number of protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe the molecule's total protons equal total neutrons? Or each atom in the molecule?

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says, "W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So if W is a molecule, perhaps each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. For example, if it's O2, each O atom has 8 protons, but O typically has 8 neutrons in the common isotope (like O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons (8×2) and 16 neutrons (8×2). So 16=16, which fits. But wait, O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons in O-16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that would make the number equal, so W could be O2. But wait, maybe other possibilities.

Another possibility is that each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, CO2: each molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 8×2=22. Neutrons: 6 + 8×2=22. So 22=22. That also fits. So W could be CO2. But wait, what's a gas that's produced in such reactions?

Wait, the reaction between substance X and Y is violent. Let's think about what kind of reactions are violent. Maybe an acid-base reaction that's exothermic? Or a reaction involving metals and strong acids?

Wait, but gas W is released. When metals react with strong acids, hydrogen gas is often released. But hydrogen's molecule is H2, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron in each atom (assuming H is protium, the lightest isotope). So each H2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron in H1). So 2 protons and 2 neutrons: 2=2. That fits. So W could be H2.

But wait, if X is a metal reacting with an acid (Y), they produce hydrogen gas. Then, precipitate G forms. When metal reacts with acid, the precipitate could be a metal salt. But what's next? The precipitate G is heated and releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C). So B is a solid at room temperature but melts just a bit above 0. That doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps B is a solid with a melting point near that, but maybe it's water? No, water's melting point is 273 K. So maybe B is another substance.

Wait, perhaps B is a byproduct. Let's think about the reaction. If X is a metal, Y is an acid like HCl or H2SO4. The reaction produces H2 gas (W), a metal chloride (G, the precipitate), and possibly some other product. Heating G would decompose it, maybe releasing something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a metal reacting with a strong acid. For example, sodium reacting with water. But that's more of a violent reaction. Alternatively, think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a liquid (like water) but that might not produce a precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) contains 2 oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid (which has a carbonyl group), the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think about the possible reagents. Maybe X is something like a strong base, like NaOH, which can react with a keto acid like a carboxylic acid to form a salt. Let's say the keto acid is RCOOH. Reacting with NaOH (X) would produce RCOO^- Na^+ and water. So the product is a sodium carboxylate. How many oxygen atoms? The sodium salt of the carboxylic acid (RCOO^- Na^+) would have O from the carboxylate. The keto acid has a structure like O=C(OH)-R. When it loses a proton, it becomes O-COO^-.

Wait, the product of the reaction has 2 O atoms. Maybe the product is something like a carbonate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product after reaction with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. That makes me think of water, but water has H2O, which is O and H. But maybe the product is something else. Or perhaps it's CO2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, think of the product as a molecule with two oxygen atoms. Like O2, but that's the gas itself.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a strong base and a carbonyl compound. For example, Grignard reagents or something else. Alternatively, maybe X is something like LiAlH4, but that's more of a reducing agent. Alternatively, X could be a base like Mg(OH)2. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. If Y is a liquid, perhaps it's a solution. So maybe X is a metal and Y is a salt solution that upon reaction produces a less soluble salt.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavier isotope-containing substance. For example, if X is a metal with a heavy isotope. Let's say X is sodium with a heavy isotope, like Na-23 (which is the common one, but wait, that's not heavier. Wait, sodium's common isotope is Na-23 (11 protons, 12 neutrons). Wait, but wait, sodium typically has about 23 atomic mass. Oh wait, maybe X is something like Cl-35, which is a heavier isotope of chlorine.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's try to figure out what B is. B is produced when G is heated, and its melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4°C. So, what's a solid that melts near there? Well, water (ice) melts at 273 K, so B could be water. Wait, but 277 is a bit higher than 0°C. So maybe it's a different compound. Wait, maybe B is another solid, like a metal, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps it's a salt that melts around that temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is carbon dioxide. But CO2 is a gas, so that doesn't make sense. Or B could be a solid like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G when heated releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and something else. Or if G is a bicarbonate, heating might release CO2 and water.

Wait, but if G is a carbonate and upon heating it decomposes, perhaps that's the case. For example, calcium carbonate decomposes into CaO and CO2 upon heating. But that would produce CO2 (which is gas W), but earlier, W was the gas from the reaction between X and Y. Wait, but in that case, decomposing G would produce CO2, but earlier, W was the gas. So maybe W is CO2.

Wait, let's try to connect the dots. Suppose X is a metal, say sodium. Y is water. Sodium reacts violently with water, producing sodium hydroxide (which is a strong base, perhaps G is NaOH, but that's a solution, not a precipitate. Hmm. Alternatively, Y could be an acid. Let's say Y is a dilute hydrochloric acid. Sodium reacts with HCl to produce NaCl (a solution, so maybe G is a precipitate, but NaCl is soluble, so that might not fit).

Wait, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a solution of a salt to produce a less soluble salt. For example, a group 2 metal like calcium. Suppose Y is a solution of a lead nitrate. Calcium would react with Pb(NO3)2 to produce PbCO3 precipitate if carbonate is present, but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else. Let me think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product contains 2 O atoms. So perhaps X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid to form a salt and water. For example, if the keto acid is H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's more of a weak acid. Reacting with a base like NaOH would produce Na2CO3, which has 3 O atoms per carbonate ion. Wait, but the product is said to have 2 O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a metal oxide. For example, if X is a metal and the keto acid is something else. Let me think about a reaction where a metal (X) reacts with a carboxylic acid (keto acid) to form a salt and water. The salt would have the formula M(COOH)something. Wait, but the product has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a molecule like H2O, which has O, but that's just one O per molecule. Wait, the product has two O atoms, but in what form?

Wait, perhaps the product is a metal oxide, like Na2O. For example, if X is sodium and the keto acid is something like H2O, but that's not a keto acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonate. For example, if the reaction is between X (a base) and a keto acid (like carbonic acid H2CO3), producing a carbonate salt and water. The salt would have carbonate ions (CO3^2-), which have three O atoms. But the product is said to have two O atoms. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to think about the initial reaction again.

Substance X reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So for each molecule, total protons = total neutrons. Let me think of possible gases:

- H2: each H has 1p, 1n. So each molecule has 2p and 2n. 2=2. Fits.
- O2: each O has 8p, 8n. So O2 has 16p and 16n. 16=16. Fits.
- N2: each N has 7p and 7n (in N-14). So N2 has 14p and 14n. 14=14. Fits.
- CO2: each CO2 molecule has 6p (C) + 16p (O2) =22p; 6n (C) + 16n (O2) =22n. So 22=22. Fits.
- H2O: each molecule has 2p (from H2) and 8p (O) → total 10p. H has 1n each (2n), O has 8n → 10n. 10=10. Fits.

So gas W could be any of these, but which one is more likely in a violent reaction?

If X is a metal reacting with a strong acid, then H2 is the gas. So W is H2.

So Y could be a strong acid, like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Then X is a metal that reacts with the acid to produce H2.

The precipitate G is formed, which on heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Let's think, what's a solid that melts around 4°C? Well, perhaps ammonium chloride? Or maybe something else.

Wait, when a metal reacts with an acid, the reaction produces a metal salt. For instance, sodium reacting with HCl would produce NaCl. But NaCl is soluble in water, so it wouldn't form a precipitate. So perhaps Y is not an acid but a salt solution. For example, if X is sodium and Y is a solution of a less soluble salt, like silver nitrate. Sodium would displace Ag, producing NaNO3 (soluble) and Ag metal (precipitate). But that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate. For example, if X is a metal and Y is a carbonate solution, the reaction could produce CO2 gas (W), a metal carbonate (G), and possibly a salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a carbonate solution, X is a metal, reaction produces CO2 gas. Then G is a metal carbonate, which when heated decomposes into metal oxide and CO2. So B would be CO2 again, but that doesn't fit the melting point.

Hmm, maybe the precipitate is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal reacting with a solution of another metal's hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a liquid that's a solution of a salt. For example, magnesium reacting with a solution of lead nitrate. Mg would displace Pb, producing Mg(NO3)2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe X is a more reactive metal that displaces a less reactive one from a salt solution, but that would require the salt to be less soluble. For example, Na reacting with a solution of CuSO4. Na would displace Cu, but Na is not strong enough to reduce CuSO4. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't between a metal and a salt, but between a base and an acid. For example, if X is a strong base like NaOH, and Y is an acid like H2SO4. But that would produce water and Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a compound that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For instance, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl solution, then AgCl precipitate forms, and gas is released? Wait, no—when AgNO3 reacts with NaCl, it forms AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. No gas is released in that reaction because it's a simple double displacement.

Wait, but in the problem, the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a rapid reaction, like a metal reacting with an acid to produce H2 quickly.

Let me try to think of X as a metal with a heavy isotope. For example, if X is a metal with, say, chlorine-35 instead of the more common chlorine-35 (but wait, chlorine-35 is the main isotope, so maybe X is something else.

Wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of a halogen. For example, Cl2, but using Cl-37 instead of Cl-35 as the heavier isotope.

Wait, but if X is Cl2, which is a gas, but the question says it's a substance that reacts with a liquid Y. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). If X is a base, like NaOH, the reaction would produce sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na^+), which has O's in the acetate ion. Each acetate ion has two O's connected to the C. So the product would have acetate ions, which have two O's. Wait, but in the product, how many O's are present? Let me see: acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it reacts with NaOH, it forms CH3COO^- Na^+ and H2O. So the product is sodium acetate and water. The sodium acetate has the acetate ion, which has two O's attached to the C. So, the product (sodium acetate) would have acetate groups with two O's. So the product has two O's per acetate ion.

Wait, but the problem says the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms. So sodium acetate is a salt, but each acetate has two O's. So maybe that's correct.

So if X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide), which is a base, and the keto acid is acetic acid, the product would be sodium acetate and water. So sodium acetate has the acetate ion, which has two O's. But each acetate ion has two O's in the carbonyl group. So that fits the description of the product containing 2 O atoms.

So X is NaOH. Now, what about the initial reaction between X and Y?

X (NaOH) reacts with Y (a liquid), producing gas W, precipitate G, and B. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base; reacting it with what would produce a precipitate and gas? Hmm, maybe Y is a carbonate. For example, if Y is a carbonate solution, like Na2CO3, but that's soluble. Alternatively, Y could be a solution of a metal carbonate, which when reacted with NaOH might produce a precipitate.

Wait, but if Y is a carbonate, like K2CO3, reacting with NaOH would produce Na2CO3, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a sulfate, but that wouldn't produce a gas.

Wait, another angle: when X is NaOH and Y is a liquid, perhaps it's another base or an acid. If Y is a weak acid, like vinegar (acetic acid), then NaOH and acetic acid would neutralize each other, producing sodium acetate and water, but no gas or precipitate. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps Y is a salt solution that when reacted with NaOH produces a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of Fe(NO3)3, then NaOH would react to produce Fe(OH)3 precipitate. But that doesn't produce a gas.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a lead nitrate. NaOH would react to produce Pb(OH)2, which is a precipitate. But again, no gas.

Wait, but in the initial reaction, a gas is released. So perhaps Y is an acid that reacts with NaOH to produce a salt and water, but that doesn't produce gas. Unless it's a carbonate, which would produce CO2 gas. Wait, if Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but that's soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a bicarbonate solution, like NaHCO3. Reacting with NaOH would produce Na2CO3, water, and no gas, but maybe CO2 isn't released. Wait, unless it's a different carbonate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a less soluble carbonate. For example, calcium carbonate is not very soluble. If X is NaOH, but how would that reaction proceed? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate that reacts with X (NaOH) to produce a metal hydroxide precipitate and release CO2 gas.

Wait, but without a clear path, maybe I should try to think of the elements in X. X has a heavier isotope. So if X is NaOH, the elements present are Na, O, and H. Na typically has a main isotope of Na-23 (11 protons, 12 neutrons). O is usually O-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons), but can have heavier isotopes like O-17 and O-18. H can be H-1 (no neutrons) or H-2 (1 neutron).

So the lightest elements in X are H and O. Wait, no: the elements in X are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Na (atomic number 11), but wait, oxygen is atomic number 8, which is lighter than Na. So the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Wait, no: atomic mass of O is about 16, Na is about 23, and H is 1. So in X (NaOH), the elements are Na (heaviest), O, and H (lightest).

So the lightest element is H (mass 1) and the heaviest is Na (mass 23). Their cumulative atomic masses would be 1 + 23 = 24. But looking at the options, I don't see 24. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe X isn't NaOH. Let me think again.

Another approach: the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two O atoms. The product could be a carbonate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. If the keto acid is water (H2O, but that's not a keto acid), then the product would be a metal oxide. Wait, but water is not a keto acid.

Wait, maybe the product is a molecule like H2O2, but that's a peroxide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. So if X is a metal and the keto acid is something else.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point of ~277 K. Let me think about what that could be. 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid that melts at around that temperature. Hmm, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? No, because NaOH is a solid that melts at higher temperatures.

Wait, maybe B is sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) has a melting point around 854°C, which is way higher. Not matching.

Wait, maybe B is another compound. Wait, 277 K is roughly 4°C, so perhaps B is a solid like ammonium chloride, which has a melting point around 334 K (61°C). No, that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is a different substance. Another approach: the melting point of 277 K is about 4°C, which is the melting point of ice. So B could be water. If G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases water, then G must be something that has water of crystallization. For example, perhaps G is a hydrated salt, like copper sulfate pentahydrate. When heated, it loses water, producing an anhydrous salt and water vapor. But in that case, B would be water vapor, but the melting point of water is 273 K, close to 277 K. So that's a possibility.

So if G is a hydrated salt, upon heating, it releases water. So B is H2O. Then the melting point of B is ~273 K, which matches the given 277 K closely.

So putting it together: X reacts with Y to produce gas W (which is H2), precipitate G (which is a hydrated salt), and another product. Heating G releases B (H2O).

Now, what is X and Y in this scenario?

If W is H2, Y could be an acid like H2SO4, and X is a metal. For example, X is Mg reacting with H2SO4 to produce MgSO4 (soluble, so no precipitate), H2 gas, and water. But that doesn't produce a precipitate G. Hmm.

Wait, unless Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a less soluble salt. For example, if Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is NaCl. Then, NaCl and AgNO3 react to produce AgCl precipitate (G) and NaNO3. No gas is produced in this reaction, so that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3 (but that's a solid, not a liquid). Hmm.

Wait, going back, if Y is a liquid and X is a metal, then Y could be a solution of a nitrate. For example, X is Zn, Y is Cu(NO3)2 solution. Zn displaces Cu, producing Cu (precipitate), Zn(NO3)2 solution, and no gas. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution containing a carbonate. Let me think: if X is Zn, Y is Na2CO3 solution. The reaction would be Zn + Na2CO3 → ZnCO3 (precipitate) + 2 Na. But wait, that's not a correct reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces CO2 gas.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. For example, X is K2CO3 (a solid, but the question says X is a substance, could be solid, liquid, or gas? Well, Y is a liquid, so X could be a solid). So X is K2CO3 (solid), Y is HCl (liquid). They react to produce KCl, CO2 gas (W), and H2O. The precipitate G would be KCl, which is soluble, so no. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is CaCO3, which is a solid, and Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, CaCl2 (soluble), and H2O. Again, no precipitate. So that scenario doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to focus on the isotopes part.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So for example, if X is Cl2, with Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes, but the heavier one is Cl-37. But earlier, I thought X might be NaOH, but that didn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a halogen with a heavier isotope. For example, if X is chlorine, but that's a gas, and Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is a solution containing a salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a diatomic molecule of a heavy isotope, like Cl-372 (but that doesn't make sense). Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the product of X and a keto acid. The product has 2 O atoms. If X is something like LiAlH4 (a reducing agent), and the keto acid is something like H2O (though H2O is not a keto acid), the product could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, and when it reacts with a keto acid, the product is a salt with a certain number of O atoms. For example, if X is Mg (with a heavy isotope, say Mg-26), and the keto acid is H2SO4, the reaction would produce MgSO4 and H2O. The product (MgSO4) has four O atoms, which doesn't fit the condition. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like O2. But how would that happen from a reaction between X and a keto acid?

Wait, maybe the product is H2O, with two H's and one O. So two O atoms? No, that's only one O per molecule. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: if the product is a peroxide, like H2O2. That has two O atoms. So perhaps X reacts with a keto acid to form H2O2. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate. For example, X is a base, and the keto acid is CO2 (but CO2 is not a keto acid). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound. For example, X could be a reducing agent that reduces a keto acid to an alcohol, but that would add H's, not necessarily O's.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to look at the options again. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

So possible sums could be:

- 1 (H) + 35 (Br) = 36 → not an option.

Wait, let's think of elements in X. If X is a diatomic molecule, like Cl2, then the elements are Cl. So lightest and heaviest would be Cl. So the sum would be 35 (Cl) + 35 (Cl) =70, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with two different elements. For example, NaOH has Na, O, H. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But 24 isn't an option.

Wait, options are 25, 29, etc. So perhaps X has elements heavier than Na.

Wait, if X is CaCO3, then the elements are Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C (12) and O (16), but Ca is 40. So the lightest and heaviest would be C (12) and Ca (40). Sum is 52, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that's a stretch.

Wait, going back to the initial part: the reaction of X with Y produces a gas W with equal protons and neutrons per molecule. And W is H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc.

If W is O2, then the reaction is likely to be something that produces oxygen gas. For example, the decomposition of a compound containing O. But in that case, what would X be?

Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2. Let's think, if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, then CO2 is released. So X could be a carbonate, Y an acid. The reaction would produce CO2, a salt, and water. The precipitate G would be the salt. If the salt is a carbonate, but when heated, it would decompose into CO2 and the metal oxide. Wait, but that would mean B is CO2, which has a melting point of about 273 K. But the problem states B's melting point is near 277 K.

Wait, but the product of X and the keto acid has 2 O atoms. If X is Na2CO3 and the keto acid is H2O (but not a keto acid), the product would be Na2CO3·nH2O, which is a hydrated salt. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should consider the options again. The options for the sum are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Looking at possible combinations:

- If the lightest is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35), sum is 36. Not an option.
- If lightest is O (16) and heaviest is F (19), sum is 35. Option A is 35.
- Or, if X contains O (16) and Cl (35), sum is 51. Not an option.
- If X contains O (16) and Na (23), sum is 39. Not an option.
- If X contains H (1) and Cl (35), sum is 36. Not an option.
- If X contains C (12) and O (16), sum is 28. Close to option D (29).

Wait, perhaps the lightest element is C (12) and heaviest is F (19). Sum is 31. That's option C.

Wait, but how would X have C and F? Maybe X is something like CH3F or a compound with both elements. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X has O (16) and F (19), sum is 35 (option A). Or if X has O (16) and Na (23), sum is 39, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: X contains O (16) and Cl (35). The sum would be 16 +35=51, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the initial reaction again.

X is a substance with a heavier isotope. Maybe X is a heavy isotope of a diatomic gas, like Cl2 (with Cl-37). So X is Cl2, which is a gas, but the question says Y is a liquid. So X and Y could be Cl2 (gas) and water (liquid), but their reaction is not typically violent unless under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of chlorine, and Y is a solution of sodium hydroxide. The reaction could produce Cl2 gas, but that's not matching the W description.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and the clues.

If the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms, perhaps X is something like Mg, which when reacted with a keto acid (like H2O, but again, not a keto acid) produces MgO. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If the product is a molecule like H2O, which has O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the product is a carbonate (CO3^2-), which has three O's, but the problem says two. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester, which has an O in the carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has a carbonyl group. But that's not formed from a base and a keto acid, but perhaps through a different reaction.

I'm really not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, not an option.

If X is NH3 (but that's a gas), but the reaction with Y (liquid) might produce something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is CaO, a solid, and reacts with a keto acid like H2O (but again, not a keto acid). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium (D2). But D2 is a gas, and Y is a liquid. Their reaction could be something else, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of a metal, like lead. But that's a heavy metal, and its reactions are less likely to produce gases.

I think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the sum is probably 29 or 31.

Wait, another angle: if X is a heavy isotope of chlorine (Cl-37), then the lightest element in X is Cl (35), but that's not lighter than other elements. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing O and another element. For example, O and Cl. So the lightest is O (16), heaviest Cl (35). Sum is 51. Not an option.

Alternatively, X contains O (16) and Na (23). Sum is 39. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of a heavier isotope, like Br2. The reaction of Br2 with Y (maybe a solution) could produce Br2 gas, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if X is Br2, the elements are Br. So lightest and heaviest would be Br. Sum is 80 (Br has about 80 atomic mass). Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with two different elements, like NaCl. The elements are Na (23) and Cl (35). So the lightest is Na, heaviest Cl. Sum is 23 +35=58. Not an option.

Wait, another idea: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. What if X is a base and the product is a carbonate, which has three O's. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, the product could be a molecule like O2, which has two O atoms. But how would that form from a reaction between X and a keto acid?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between X and a keto acid to produce O2. That's possible in some oxidation reactions, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is D) 29. But I'm not confident.

The question revolves around identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and involves a reaction with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, Precipitate G, and a final product B. The problem provides several clues, including the properties of the substances involved and the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Here's the analysis:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include H₂, O₂, N₂, CO₂, or H₂O. H₂ (hydrogen gas) is a likely candidate, as it is commonly produced in reactions involving metals and acids.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be water (H₂O), as its melting point is 273 K, very close to the given value. G might be a hydrated salt that releases water upon heating.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a base, as bases often react with acids to form salts and water. For example, if X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide), reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would produce sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻Na⁺) and water. Sodium acetate contains two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion.

4. **Isotope Incorporation**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is NaOH, sodium (Na) typically has a common isotope (Na-23), but it could also incorporate a heavier isotope like Na-25.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The lightest element in X is hydrogen (H, atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23). The cumulative atomic mass of these two elements is 1 + 23 = 24. However, this value is not among the provided options. Reconsidering the options, if X contains oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16) and another heavier element like fluorine (F, atomic mass ~19), the cumulative atomic mass would be 16 + 19 = 35, which matches option A. This aligns with the possibility of X being a compound like NaOH or a similar base.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **A) 35**, as it accounts for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering the possibility of heavier isotopes and the reaction chemistry described.
