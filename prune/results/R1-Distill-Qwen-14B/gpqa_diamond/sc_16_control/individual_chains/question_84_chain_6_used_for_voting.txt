Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation. The options are A to D, each related to different concepts in numerical methods.

First, I remember that solving heat equations often involves methods like finite differences, which discretize the partial differential equations into systems of algebraic equations. For higher dimensions, this system can become quite large, so solving them efficiently is important.

Parallel splitting methods are used to speed up the computation by breaking the problem into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously. This usually involves domain decomposition or other techniques. One approach I've heard about is the method of parallelizing the solution of the linear system by splitting the matrix into parts that can be handled in parallel.

The matrix exponential function comes into play when dealing with systems that can be expressed in the form u = e^(At) u0, where A is a matrix. In finite difference methods, especially implicit ones, you often end up with a system M u^{n+1} = u^n, which can be written as u^{n+1} = M^{-1} u^n. If M is the identity plus a small term, you can approximate M^{-1} using a series expansion involving the matrix exponential.

Now, the question is about a fractional approximation of the matrix exponential. Fractional methods might refer to using approximations that capture the behavior of the exponential function with fewer terms or in a different form, possibly for computational efficiency or parallelism.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: This is important in ensuring that the numerical method doesn't produce growing errors. But how does it directly relate to converting to a parallel algorithm? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a distractor.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions can complicate the problem, but I don't see the direct link to parallel algorithms. Unless nonlocal conditions require special handling that allows for splitting, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: When dealing with matrix exponentials, eigenvalues (which can be complex) play a role. If the approximation uses a method that handles complex roots effectively, it might allow for parallelism. But I'm not exactly clear on how this leads to parallel splitting.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to decompose complex expressions into simpler terms. If the matrix exponential can be decomposed into a sum of simpler terms, each term could potentially be computed in parallel. For example, if the exponential can be written as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices, each part can be handled by a different processor, making the algorithm parallel.

Wait, another angle: The conversion from sequential to parallel often relies on being able to split the problem into independent subproblems. So in the case of matrix exponentials, if the approximation method allows the matrix to be split into independent parts, each part can be exponentiated separately and then combined. For instance, if the approximation uses a partial fraction decomposition, you might split the matrix into additive components that don't interfere with each other, allowing parallel computation of each component's exponential.

So option D says linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. That sounds like breaking down the exponential into simpler fractions, each of which can be computed in parallel. That would make the algorithm parallel because each fraction's contribution can be calculated independently.

Option C is about complex roots. If the approximation relies on handling complex roots, perhaps it's about the stability or accuracy, but not directly about making the algorithm parallel. 

Another thought: when you have a matrix to exponentiate, if it can be diagonalized or decomposed into independent components, each can be exponentiated separately and then recombined. Partial fraction decomposition may facilitate this kind of splitting.

So putting it all together, the key factor is probably the ability to split the approximation into parts that can be handled independently, which the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation would allow. So the answer should be D.

The question focuses on the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function using a fractional approximation in the context of solving higher-dimensional heat equations. The matrix exponential function often arises in implicit finite difference methods, where the system can be expressed as \( u^{n+1} = M^{-1} u^n \). Approximating \( M^{-1} \) using a fractional approximation of the matrix exponential is crucial for efficiency, especially in parallel computing.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Stability analysis**: While stability is essential for ensuring accurate and non-growing errors, it does not directly explain how the algorithm is converted into a parallel one. This makes it less relevant to the question.

- **B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions**: Nonlocal boundary conditions can complicate the problem, but they do not inherently provide a mechanism for parallelization. This option is unlikely to be the key factor.

- **C) Complex roots of fractional approximation**: Complex roots may influence the behavior of the matrix exponential, but they do not directly enable the splitting of the problem into independent subproblems required for parallelism.

- **D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation**: This option refers to decomposing the fractional approximation into simpler terms, such as partial fractions, which can be computed independently. This decomposition allows for parallel computation, as each term can be handled by a different processor. This directly aligns with the requirement for converting the algorithm into a parallel one.

The key factor in enabling parallelism is the ability to split the approximation into independent components, which is facilitated by the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D
