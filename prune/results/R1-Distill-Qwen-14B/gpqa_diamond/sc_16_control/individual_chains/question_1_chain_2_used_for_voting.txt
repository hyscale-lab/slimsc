Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Alright, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its uncertainty in energy. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Since the lifetimes of the states are given, I suppose Δt is related to the lifetime. Wait, but how exactly? Oh, right, the lifetime τ is the time for which the state exists before decaying, so the uncertainty in time Δt is about τ. So for each state, Δt is roughly τ.

But wait, each state has its own lifetime. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 would be approximately ħ/(2τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, which is ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish the two states, this ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

So the condition would be ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let me plug in the numbers. First, I need to compute each ΔE.

Wait, but actually, the energy uncertainty for each state is given by the Heisenberg principle. So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE_i ≈ ħ / (2 τ_i). So for the two states, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8). 

Wait, but wait a second. The energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 is what we're concerned with. So for the energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if ΔE is larger than the uncertainties, then the lines (in spectroscopy terms) won't overlap. So:

ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let's compute that. Let me note the values:

τ1 = 1e-9 s
τ2 = 1e-8 s

So,

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * τ1) = ħ / (2e-9)
ΔE2 = ħ / (2 * τ2) = ħ / (2e-8)

So sum is (ħ/(2e-9) ) + (ħ/(2e-8)).

Wait, but that's (ħ/(2e-9) ) [1 + 10 ] = (ħ/(2e-9)) *11.

Wait, because 1e-8 is 10 times 1e-9. So 1/(1e-8) is 10 times 1/(1e-9).

So sum is (11 ħ)/(2e-9).

Wait, no: let me compute it clearly.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9) = ħ * 5e8
ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = ħ * 5e7

So sum is 5e8 ħ +5e7 ħ = 5.5e8 ħ.

Wait, that's 5.5 times 1e8 ħ.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me redo it.

Wait: 1/(1e-9) is 1e9, divided by 2 gives 5e8. So ΔE1= ħ *5e8 eV·s? Wait, no, units here. Wait, because ħ has units of J·s, but when we compute ΔE in eV, we need to convert.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the actual value using the known value of ħ. Let me recall that Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But converting that to eV·s: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So now, computing ΔE1:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) → Let's compute denominator 2e-9 s.

6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2 ) * 1e-7 → 3.291e-7 eV → approximately 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) → denominator 2e-8.

6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2 ) * 1e-8 → 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait wait, no, let's recheck:

Wait, 1e-8 s in the denominator: 6.582e-16 divided by (2e-8) is (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = (6.582/2)*1e-8 → 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.291e-7 eV, and ΔE2 ≈ 3.291e-8 eV.

So the sum of the uncertainties is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = let's compute that: 3.291e-7 is 32.91e-8. Adding 3.291e-8 gives 36.201e-8 eV → which is 3.6201e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV for the two states to be distinguishable.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3.6e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. That's bigger than 3.6e-7, so it's more than sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Which is 1e-8 = 0.1e-7. 0.1e-7 is 0.1 times 1e-7, but 3.6e-7 is 3.6 times 1e-7. So 0.1e-7 is smaller than 3.6e-7, so not sufficient.

So the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV, as that's the only option that exceeds the required 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recompute the ΔE sum.

ΔE1 = 3.291e-7 eV, ΔE2 = 3.291e-8 eV. Sum is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = (3.291 + 0.3291)e-7 = 3.6201e-7 eV.

So any ΔE greater than that is acceptable. So:

Option C is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. Which is 0.0001 eV.

Convert 0.0001 eV to scientific notation: 1e-4 eV.

Compare with 3.62e-7 eV: 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7. Since 3.62e-7 is about 0.000362 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is actually smaller than 3.62e-7 eV? Wait wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. 3.62e-7 is 0.000000362 eV. So 0.0001 eV is larger, right? Because 0.0001 is bigger than 0.000000362.

Wait, that's correct. Oh wait, no. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4, and 3.62e-7 is 3.62e-7, which is about 0.000000362. So 1e-4 is 100,000 times larger than 3.62e-7. So the energy difference in option C is way larger than the sum of the uncertainties, which means they can be clearly distinguished. So option C is acceptable.

Wait, but wait, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.62e-7 eV. So D is too small. So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, let me think again. The condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of uncertainties. So any ΔE larger than that sum is okay.

So in this case, the smallest ΔE that suffices is just above 3.6e-7 eV. The options given are:

A) 1e-9 → 0.000000001 → too small.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 → which is much larger than required, so it's okay.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 → which is smaller than 3.6e-7 (since 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036) → 0.00000001 is smaller, so D is too small.

Therefore, the only possible option is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}.
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2}.
\]

The reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
