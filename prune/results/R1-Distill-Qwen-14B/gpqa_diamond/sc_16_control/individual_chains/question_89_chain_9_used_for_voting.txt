Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking it down step by step. So, the question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to visualize each step and the products.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C probably leads to an elimination reaction. Since it's KOH, which is a strong base, this is likely an E2 mechanism. Dibromide usually undergoes dehydrohalogenation, so two bromides would eliminate, probably forming a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the structure is quite rigid. So, when you eliminate two bromides from adjacent carbons, you get an allene? Because the double bonds can't be conjugated in adamantane? Or maybe just a double bond?

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons if it's a three-carbon chain in the adamantane structure? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so each carbon is connected to four others, but considering the positions, 1 and 3 are across each other. Wait, perhaps elimination would form a bridge or a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a diradical or a conjugated diene? Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the product when heated with KOH is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's often indicative of an alcohol or maybe a ketone group, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from the dibromide?

Oh wait, elimination of HBr can form a ketone. Because if two adjacent bromides are eliminated, perhaps a neighboring group could form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but how does that work?

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation. For example, each bromide leaves, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted by OH- leading to the formation of a double bond, but since it's a dihalide, perhaps two dehydrohalogenations lead to an elimination of two HBr molecules and form a conjugated diene? But how about the NMR and IR data?

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong absorption for a carbonyl group. That suggests that the product is a ketone. So, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make immediate sense. Unless it's a ring-opening or some kind of fragmentation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that's when vicinal diols eliminate. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double elimination to form an epoxide? No, because epoxide would have different NMR signals. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone formed via elimination, perhaps via a diradical mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, another angle: the initial reaction is elimination, but perhaps it's an elimination followed by a rearrangement. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons but not adjacent in the sense of being next to each other—more like, perhaps, across a bridge. Wait, so if you have Br on 1 and 3, when you eliminate, perhaps the Br leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted, but since they're not adjacent, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's check the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a -CH2-O- group, but wait, in this reaction, the product is formed with KOH, which is a strong base. Alternatively, that could be an -OH group, but that would be a broad peak, not a sharp one. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Because in a ketone, the alpha hydrogens (CH2 groups next to the carbonyl) typically show up around 2.1-2.6 ppm. But the 4.79 ppm is higher, which is more like an ether or maybe a diol. Hmm, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone with some other groups.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. How? If the two Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require a structure where two adjacent carbons lose Br and form a double bond. But wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridgehead structure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating both forms a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of the reaction conditions. Heating with KOH in excess. Another possibility is that it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but that wouldn't explain the IR carbonyl. Unless the alkene is part of a conjugated system, but then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so that's not a diol, which would have OH groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with excess KOH and heating, more likely elimination. So, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon dehydrohalogenation would lose two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of a ketone. So, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and eliminating them would form a carbonyl group. Wait, for that, perhaps the two HBr eliminations lead to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about the wrong structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings; the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, when you eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps the two bridgehead Br atoms are removed, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. So, the structure would be a bridgehead carbonyl, making 1,3-diketone? But that doesn't fit because 1 and 3 are across each other in the adamantane structure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a different bridgehead, and elimination forms a single ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination of HBr from each leads to a bridged ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Pinacol is 1,2-diol which upon elimination of water gives a ketone. But in this case, it's a dihalide. So if we have 1,3-dibromide, and eliminate both HBr, perhaps the two adjacent Br are eliminated, and the resulting structure has a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination is a cyclohexenone or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone at a bridgehead. But I'm not sure of the exact structure.

Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably something like a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom. Maybe an -O-CH2-O- group, but that would be more like an ether. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the neighboring group would be CH2, which typically appears around 2.1-2.6 ppm. But 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's an -OCH2O- group, but that would be in a diether or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group, but that's usually lower field. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 is an -OCH2- group, like an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diether. But without knowing the structure, it's hard. Maybe I should think about the next steps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating, forming product 2. Hmm. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but what's the substrate here? If product 1 is a ketone, then a Friedel-Crafts would require an aromatic ring, which I don't think adamantane has. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via some kind of alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but with Al as a Lewis acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation if product 1 is a ketone that can act as an acylating agent. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is an epoxide. But the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but then the IR wouldn't have the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which would have a carbonyl adjacent to an ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Let's say the product is 1-adamantanone. Then, product 2 is made by treating this with aluminum isopropoxide. How would that react? 1-adamantanone is a ketone. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in the formation of enolates. So perhaps product 2 is the enolate of 1-adamantanone. But enolates are usually formed under basic conditions, but Al is a Lewis acid, maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone, but that's unlikely because the initial structure is 1,3-dibromide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the IR and NMR data. IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a ketone. So product 1 must have a ketone group. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 for 2H, which is a bit unusual. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first reaction forms an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't have a strong C=O peak. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. But then again, the IR data doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. Let's say that the product is 1-adamantanone. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl as around 2.1-2.6 ppm. But in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is for 2H, which is higher. So perhaps that's an -OCH2- group. Wait, but how would that form from the dibromide?

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a glycol, but again, the IR data suggests a carbonyl.

Another thought: Maybe the first reaction forms a ketone and an epoxide. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl with an adjacent ethylene group. So the NMR at 4.79 is a CH2 adjacent to a double bond, making it deshielded. But then the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product structure again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Dehydrohalogenation would eliminate HBr, possibly forming a double bond. But for a ketone to form, perhaps two elimination steps are needed. Wait, maybe the elimination forms an allylic bromide, but that's not likely with KOH.

Alternatively, maybe it's a condensation reaction. Wait, but with KOH, more likely elimination.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about what product 2 is. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. So if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation of an aromatic ring, but I don't know if product 1 has an aromatic ring.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone. When treated with Al(OR)3, perhaps a enol silyl ether is formed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid. It could facilitate the formation of a carbocation or something. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I don't see how the IR data fits. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an alkyl aluminum compound. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should move forward to the third step, as maybe that will help.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 has a double bond. Then, product 3 is the ozonolysis product. The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, let's reconstruct:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with C=O) via KOH.

2. Product 1 → product 2 via Al isopropoxide.

3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But I'm not seeing the structure clearly. Maybe I should think about the structure of product 2.

Wait, product 2 is formed by treating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted or rearranged structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I don't know what the substrate would be.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol after acid workup. But no, aluminum is a Lewis acid, not a base.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a carbonyl, and product 2 is an enol ether or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is the result of a pinacol-type rearrangement, but that requires a diol.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me imagine the adamantane structure. It's a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, if each bridgehead has a Br, then eliminating two HBr's would form a bridge between them, creating a ketone. Wait, that makes sense. So, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Eliminating HBr from each would form a bridgehead ketone. So, the product 1 would be 1,3-diketone? But in adamantane, the bridgehead can't have two ketones because of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a single ketone. So, the two bridgehead Brs are eliminated, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Wait, but bridgehead carbonyls are not possible because of the structure. Hmm. I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps upon elimination, the structure becomes a norbornene-like structure with a carbonyl. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is a macrocyclic ketone, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's proceed with the assumption that product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

So, product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

The NMR of product 3 would show the carbonyl groups and any remaining hydrogen groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near a carbonyl group.

In ozone cleavage, the double bond is cleaved, and the ends become carbonyls. If the double bond was in a symmetric position, the product would have two identical carbonyl groups. If asymmetric, two different groups.

Now, the NMR question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Since the ozonolysis is done at -78°C and followed by dimethyl sulfide, it's a reductive workup. Wait, no, dimethyl sulfide is a mild reductant, maybe leading to formation of aldehydes or ketones, but not necessarily breaking into smaller fragments.

Wait, more accurately, ozonolysis of a double bond generally breaks it into two carbonyl groups. The exact structure depends on the substituents.

So, in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, if there's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, its hydrogens would be deshielded and appear around 2.1-2.6 ppm. But wait, the question asks for the coupling pattern.

In such a scenario, each hydrogen on a CH2 next to a carbonyl would be split by neighboring hydrogens. If the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each hydrogen would be coupled with both adjacent groups.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, if the original alkene was symmetric, product 3 might have two identical groups. For example, if the alkene was between two identical groups, the resulting carbonyl groups would be the same.

But if the alkene was in a more complex structure, the ozonolysis product might have different groups.

Wait, maybe in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring hydrogens.

Suppose the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group. Then, each hydrogen on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring group. For example, if each hydrogen is adjacent to a CH2 group, each would have coupling with two neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. Then, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have their hydrogens split by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between two carbonyl groups. So, the structure would be O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R-C=O. No, that's unlikely because ozonolysis typically breaks the double bond into two carbonyls on each end.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. But that would make the CH2 in the middle. Wait, but each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps each end of the ozonolysis product is a carbonyl, and the middle has a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. So, each hydrogen on the central CH2 would be coupled with the two hydrogens on each adjacent CH2. But that might complicate the splitting.

Wait, maybe each CH2 is only coupled with one neighboring group. Let's simplify: suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Each hydrogen on the first CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2, which has two hydrogens. So, each hydrogen would be a doublet (coupled to two equivalent Hs). But wait, if the adjacent group has two Hs, then each H would be a triplet. Because each H on CH2_A is next to CH2_B, which has two Hs, each H on CH2_A would split into a triplet. Similarly, the Hs on CH2_B would each be triplets.

Wait, no. For a CH2 next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. So, each CH2 group would show as a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 is next to another CH2, so each H would be a triplet. But the question is about the most deshielded H. The deshielded Hs would be those next to the carbonyl. So, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would have their Hs appearing around 2.1-2.6 ppm. Each of their Hs would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the options, triplet is an option (option A), but I can't be sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex, leading to each H being coupled with more than one set of Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another group, leading to more complex couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH2 next to a carbonyl and another CH2 that's part of a ring or another structure, leading to more complex splitting.

Let me think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. If that H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H in the CH2 would be split into a triplet. But maybe there's another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 and another group, leading to a more complex splitting. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two Hs, that would add more splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is part of an allene or some conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, each end is a carbonyl, and the adjacent CH2 groups would each have two Hs. So, each of these Hs would be next to another CH2 group, leading to coupling. So, each H would be a triplet.

But perhaps each CH2 is also coupled to a neighboring group beyond the adjacent CH2, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another group. So, each H on the first CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another group. That would lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering the options, perhaps the most likely coupling is a triplet of triplets or a triplet.

Wait, in the initial reaction, the product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is perhaps an enol ether or something with a double bond. Ozonolysis of product 2 would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is the conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would form two carbonyl groups. So, the product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if the diene was symmetric, the product would have identical groups. If it's asymmetric, different groups.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like CH2-CO-R, where the CH2 is next to the carbonyl.

Each H on the CH2 would be a triplet if coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But if each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2, then triplet is the result.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 and another group, maybe with more Hs, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled to two different sets of Hs. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 (two Hs) and also next to a CH that has two Hs, each H would be a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. Each H would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if that CH2 is also adjacent to another group with Hs, perhaps the splitting becomes more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to each H being a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Options are:
A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

If product 3 has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each H would be a triplet. So option A.

But wait, maybe each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two on the other, but that's not likely because each CH2 has only two Hs. So each H would be split by two Hs on one adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another group with a single H, like a CH group, then the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. The Hs on each CH2 would be next to two Hs, so each would be a triplet. Thus, the NMR would show a triplet for each CH2.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the ones closest to the carbonyl. So in that case, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded and would show as triplets.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if each of those CH2 groups is next to a carbonyl and also a CH group with two Hs, then each H would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and two Hs from another group, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a ring, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is more complicated. For example, each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and one H from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure leads to each H being coupled with two different sets of Hs, each of which is a doublet, leading to a doublet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, considering that the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl, and perhaps in a geminal position with another H, but that's more about coupling with adjacent Hs.

Wait, another approach: the ozonolysis of a symmetric diene would give two identical carbonyl groups. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would each have two Hs, and each H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, in the NMR, each H would be a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and another two from another, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a bridge, leading to each H being coupled with more than two Hs.

Wait, in product 3, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So each H would be coupled with four Hs in total, leading to a quintet. But that would be option D, a pentet. But I think that's less likely.

Another thought: if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each internal CH2 would have two adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H on the middle CH2 would be coupled with four Hs (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and another two Hs from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Given the options and the reasoning, I think the most probable answer is a triplet. So, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C likely results in a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules). This forms a ketone, as indicated by the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports the formation of a ketone, likely 1-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Treating the ketone with aluminum isopropoxide likely facilitates the formation of an enolate or a related structure. However, the exact nature of product 2 is not explicitly determined. It is inferred that product 2 contains a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis and workup**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond to form carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Based on the splitting patterns, the hydrogens on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl are coupled with two equivalent hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet.

4. **Analysis of coupling patterns**:  
   - **Option A (triplet)**: This is consistent with a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, where each hydrogen is split by the two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂.  
   - **Option B (triplet of triplets)**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of hydrogens, which is less likely given the symmetry of the product.  
   - **Option C (doublet of triplets)**: This would require coupling with one hydrogen and two equivalent hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.  
   - **Option D (pentet)**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is unlikely given the structure of the product.

The most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

Answer: A
