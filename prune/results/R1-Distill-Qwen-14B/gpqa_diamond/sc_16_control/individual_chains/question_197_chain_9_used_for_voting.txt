Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not entirely confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of certain groups, maybe something like the hydrolysis of an ester or a nitrile. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to give amines or something else? Or maybe it's for the elimination reaction? Or perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction? Wait, Clemmensen is with Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, right. Red phosphorus and HI—maybe it's for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce an ester group. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. When you have a nitrile, treating with HI and red phosphorus might convert it to an amine. Because I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amines using H2O and a catalyst, but maybe HI is a better source of H+ or something. Alternatively, maybe it's about the hydrolysis of a benzyl chloride or another leaving group.

Wait, but the initial compound X has IR and NMR data. Let me look at that.

IR data: 3400–2500 cm⁻¹—that’s a broad peak, usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretching. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol group? But wait, the other peaks: 1720 cm⁻¹ is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring, possibly with some substitution. The 1720 could be a carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's pretty upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, 10 ppm is more likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids typically have protons around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. So this could be a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde, but if it's an aldehyde, the integration is 1H, which would make sense for a single aldehyde proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That's probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Like in a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. So maybe the ring is 1,4-disubstituted, with two sets of two protons each. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet of 1H. This could be a methine proton adjacent to something, maybe near an electronegative atom or in a chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet. Maybe part of a CH2 group near something else, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen or another CH group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet? Wait, the description says (d, 3H). Wait, no, the notation is (d, 3H). That would be a triplet, but written as d, but maybe a doublet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet in the splitting. Wait, perhaps it's a methylene group next to a CH. Or wait, 1.4 ppm is around where a methyl group attached to an oxygen might be, but the splitting as a doublet suggests it's a CH3 group attached to a CH2 or CH group.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the integration. The NMR has:

- 10.5 (1H)
- 8.0 (2H)
- 7.2 (2H)
- 2.9 (1H)
- 1.7 (2H)
- 1.4 (3H)
- 0.9 (3H, t)

So the 0.9 ppm triplet with 3H is likely a methyl group attached to something like a CH2. Because the triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 (each proton in the CH2 would split the methyl into a triplet). So that would be a CH2CH2CH3 group, but perhaps more accurately, a CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something. Wait, no. Let me think of substituents.

Alternatively, the CH2 might be adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, in an ethyl chain.

Looking at the integration: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H. Wait, no, (d,3H). A doublet for a methyl group. That's unusual because methyl groups are typically triplets or singlets. Wait, a methyl group attached to a CH would be a doublet because the CH has one neighboring group. So if the CH is connected to the methyl, then the CH's protons would split the methyl into a doublet. But wait, the CH would be a multiplet because of neighboring groups. So perhaps the structure is something like CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3 or similar.

Wait, perhaps it's a branching. Let me try to piece this together.

So, the aromatic signals: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each as doublets, 2H each. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are in the para positions. So one substituent is at position 1 (let's say), and another at position 4 (if we're considering 1 and 4 as opposite in the ring), but wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So substituents in positions 1 and 4 would be across from each other. So each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be in a certain pattern.

Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to each substituent are equivalent, hence each would appear as a doublet. So if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are equivalent. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the ring would have two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. So, for example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 would not be para. Wait, perhaps substituents are at positions 1 and 4? Or is that impossible?

Wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, they are opposite each other. So the protons ortho to substituent at 1 would be at 2 and 6, and para would be at 4. Wait no, substituent at 1, then the adjacent (ortho) are 2 and 6; meta are 3 and 5; para is 4. So if substituent is at 1 and also at 4, then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. So the remaining protons would be at positions 2, 3,5,6. Wait, but that can't be because each substituent has adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but that's impossible because that would be the same position. No, wait, no, each substituent is in a different position but para to each other. So substituent A at position 1, substituent B at position 4. So the ring would be 1-A, 4-B.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent A, and positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent B. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be a pair, and those at 3 and 5 another pair. So each pair would be equivalent and give a doublet. So the NMR has 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H), which matches this scenario. So the aromatic protons are split into two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the substituents are para to each other.

Now, what are these substituents? Let's think about the other signals. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which I thought could be a carboxylic acid proton. So perhaps one substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but let's look at the IR. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group. A carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, but the broad peak around 3000-2500 cm⁻¹ could be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. So that fits with the IR data.

So the substituents are -COOH and another group. Let's see what the other groups are.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a methine adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in a chain. The 1.7 (m,2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something else. The 1.4 (d,3H) could be a CH3 attached to a CH. And the 0.9 (t,3H) is a terminal CH3.

Putting that together, perhaps there's a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, let me think. The NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the CH next to that CH3. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group between the benzene and the CH.

So maybe the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4. One substituent is a -COOH group (accounting for the 10.5 ppm peak and the IR carbonyl), and the other substituent is a chain like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me try to draw it.

Suppose the benzene ring has a -COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. That substituent could be a chain like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, what else could it be?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but then what is attached to that? Let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: -COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (2H), 7.2 ppm (2H): aromatic protons, para-substituted.
- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH group.
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but where does the carbonyl come in? Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a CH2-CH2- chain, but no, that wouldn't explain the 2.9 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 group? No, that might complicate things. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to another part.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: a CH2 connected to a CH(CH2CH3) group.

So, perhaps the benzene ring has a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached at para positions.

But wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a single proton, so maybe that's the CH in the middle of a chain.

Putting it together: benzene ring, para-substituted with -COOH and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But then the CH2-CH(CH2CH3) would have the CH2 next to the ring. So the substituent would be -(CH2)-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but then the chain would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But then what's the end of the chain? Oh, perhaps the end is another CH3 group, like an ethyl group.

Wait, let me try to structure this.

The substituent at position 4 is a chain: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

No, no, because the COOH is at position 1, perhaps. So the substituents are -COOH and -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but then what is the structure of the substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH which has a methyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is -CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-. No, wait, sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, no. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached with a branch. Let me think. The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl group, probably in a CH2CH2CH3 chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group adjacent to something else, perhaps next to a CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH group connected to both a CH2 and a CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but let me visualize the structure. The substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. The CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH3 from the CH2CH3 group and a CH2 attached to the benzene.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H, which suggests a CH3 connected to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but then where is the COOH group? Because the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carbonyl group, but I'm a bit confused because the substituents are at para positions. So if the benzene has -COOH at one position and a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- at the para position, then the molecule would be something like 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think about that. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, actually, sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, let me correct. Actually, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, where the point of attachment is the CH. So the substituent is a butyl group attached via the secondary carbon.

So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, maybe it's a pentyl group, but I think I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, i.e., a isobutyl group. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, right? So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H) which would be the terminal methyl of an ethyl group. Hmm, that suggests a longer chain. Let me think: the substituent attached to the benzene is a chain that ends with an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Alternatively, let me think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a -COOH group at position 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group at position 4.

But then the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 and CH groups. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH in the middle. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group.

So putting it together, the structure would be 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid. Wait, no, 2-methylpropyl is isobutyl. So the substituent is isobutyl. So the compound would be 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check the structure of sec-butyl. Sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, actually, that's not right. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would make it a pentyl group? No, wait, no. Wait, no, butyl groups are four carbons. So a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, no. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. So the structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, that's five carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, butyl groups are four carbons. So:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no, wait. The correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's only four carbons. So the substituent is a four-carbon chain, with the point of attachment on the second carbon (the 'sec' position). So the structure would be: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a butyl group, but the CH(CH2CH3) is the second carbon. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but that would make the substituent's structure as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's four carbons: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's three carbons because the CH2 is the first, then CH is the second, then CH2CH3 is the third. Wait, no, wait. Let me count: the substituent is attached to the benzene as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a four-carbon group? No, that's three carbons because the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, but the NMR suggests a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the options provided.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group (so the 10.5 ppm peak) and a sec-butyl substituent at the para position.

So the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the -COOH group.

So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's four carbons: the first CH2, then a CH attached to another CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a four-carbon group.

So, for option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4 as a sec-butyl group.

Looking back at the NMR data. Let's see if that fits.

The substituent's structure would be:

Benzoic acid group at position 1, and a substituent at position 4 which is a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So the chain is:

Phenyl group attached to CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to CH2CH3.

So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So the NMR should reflect this. Let's see:

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the CH3 attached to the CH in the substituent.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is the CH group.

The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is the CH2 group attached to the benzene.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group (from CH2CH3).

So that seems to fit.

But wait, what about the other NMR signals? The aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, which matches the data.

The 10.5 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton.

So, in this structure, the substituents are -COOH and -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a sec-butyl group.

Now, the reaction part. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do?

Red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but in this case, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Wait, but if X is a benzoyl chloride or another acyl chloride, maybe it would react differently. Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, then HI and red phosphorus would convert it to an amine. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, which would react with HI.

Wait, but the starting material's IR shows a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a bit higher than a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700 cm⁻¹). Hmm. Wait, carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers because of hydrogen bonding. So 1720 could be an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the presence of a broad peak in IR around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H stretch, which would be from a carboxylic acid. So the 1720 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have their O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which is the case here. So the IR suggests a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI might not do much, because benzoic acid is already a carboxylic acid. Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile or an ester, which would undergo hydrolysis.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the IR data.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1 (broad), 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610, 1450.

Wait, the 1720 could be an ester. Because carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 cm⁻¹. Esters have higher frequencies, around 1720-1740 cm⁻¹.

But then the broad IR from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ would suggest an O-H stretch, but if it's an ester, that's usually not present. Unless it's an acidic ester, but that's rare. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol or another group.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So perhaps X is an aldehyde.

Wait, but let me think again. If the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid, then the IR at 1720 would be a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. Let's consider that possibility.

If X is an ester, then the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, and the broad peak around 3400–2500 could be from an O-H group, perhaps from an alcohol or another acidic proton.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have to fit an ester structure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with some substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate derivative with a substituent that includes a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the presence of the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests an ethyl group somewhere.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline what I have so far.

Based on the NMR data:

- Para-substituted benzene with substituents at 1 and 4 positions.

- One substituent is a -COOH (so option C or A, perhaps).

- The other substituent is a chain leading to a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm).

So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group, but that's not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, the substituent's NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a CH3 at the end.

So the structure for the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no. Let me think. The substituent is attached to the benzene as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group? No, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would be a four-carbon substituent.

So the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but then the chain would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which would be a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a isoamyl group? No, isoamyl is CH2CH(CH2CH2) something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. But that would be an iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group is -CH(CH3)2CH2–. No, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that might not fit the NMR. Let me think again.

If the substituent is an iso-butyl group, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group next to the benzene (Ph-CH2-).

- The CH(CH3)2 group.

But in that case, the CH2 would be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH), and the CH would be a septet (if it's a CH connected to two CH3 groups), but that doesn't match the NMR data.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but then the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is a four-carbon group attached via the second carbon.

So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, making it a sec-butyl group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to benzene (Ph-CH2-) would be split by the adjacent CH group.

The CH group is attached to CH2 and to CH2CH3.

So the CH would have neighboring protons from the CH2 and the CH2CH3 groups, leading to a multiplet.

The CH2 group would be next to the benzene and the CH, so it would be a triplet or a quartet, depending on the coupling.

The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

The CH3 attached to the CH would be a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

The CH2 next to the benzene would be a quartet, perhaps at around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, but looking back, the NMR data shows 1.7 ppm (m,2H) which could be the CH2 next to the benzene, and 1.4 ppm (d,3H) which is the CH3 attached to the CH.

So this fits with the substituent being a sec-butyl group.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction part: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What's that reaction?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines or for the elimination reactions. Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, like option C, then what reaction would occur?

Wait, but benzoic acid is already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester.

Wait, let me think again. If X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

But the starting material's IR shows a strong carbonyl around 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical of an ester. The broad peak could be from an O-H stretch of an alcohol, but that's not usually present in esters. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. If X is a nitrile, then red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to an amine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if X is a nitrile, then the IR wouldn't have a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Nitriles have a strong C≡N stretch around 2240 cm⁻¹. So the IR doesn't show that. So X isn't a nitrile.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely result in the hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Let me think about that.

But looking back, the options include benzoic acid derivatives, like option C.

So if X is an ester, and it reacts to form a carboxylic acid, then option C would be the product.

But wait, the question is about the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI. So if X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid, but if X is a nitrile, the product would be an amine.

But the IR data doesn't suggest a nitrile. So perhaps X is an ester.

But let me think again. Let me look at all steps.

1. Analyze the NMR and IR to determine X's structure.

2. Determine what reaction X undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

3. Choose the correct product from the options.

So, perhaps X is an ester. Let's say X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Its NMR would show a triplet for the methyl ester group, but in the given NMR, there's no such peak (except the 0.9 ppm which is a terminal CH3).

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propanoate or another ester.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, and option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps if X is an ester, then the reaction would produce the benzoic acid.

Wait, but the question is asking for the product when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So if X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. But the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, another possibility: X is a benzene ring with a ketone group. But the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl, but the NMR doesn't show a peak around 2 ppm which would be for a ketone's CH3.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. The 10.5 ppm peak would be the aldehyde proton, which is a singlet. The IR would have a peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ which matches the aldehyde's carbonyl. But the IR data also shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. Aldehydes don't have O-H stretches, so that might not fit.

So, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with some substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl ester. For example, methyl benzoate would have an ester group, and the substituent would be a sec-butyl group. But I'm not sure.

But given the time I've spent, I think the correct structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, adding HI and red phosphorus might not do much, unless it's undergoing some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl chloride, which would react with HI to form the acid.

But the IR doesn't show a peak around 1800 cm⁻¹ which is typical for acyl chlorides. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile, so when it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it forms an amine. But the options don't have an amine; all options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So if X is a nitrile, the product would be an amine, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps X isn't a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid.

If X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But I'm not entirely sure about the reaction conditions. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be used for elimination reactions, such as removing a leaving group to form an alkene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzyl chloride, then reaction with HI would lead to substitution, but that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl chloride, but that's probably not the case.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid based on the NMR and IR data.

So, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about X being a benzoic acid. Let me consider that X is an ester. Let's say X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So the product would be option C.

But then, the question is, what is X? Because the reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI to form the product.

Wait, but the product is one of the options, so perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the product is an amine, but that's not among the options.

Another possibility: if X is an acyl chloride, then hydrolysis with HI would produce the acid. But again, the IR doesn't show the peak for acyl chloride.

So, perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the corresponding acid, which is option C.

But wait, the question states that X has the given data, and the options are possible products.

So, the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The question involves identifying a compound (Compound X) based on its IR and NMR data and predicting its product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Step 1: Analyze IR Data
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Broad peak, indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl peak, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester. However, the broad O-H stretch suggests it is more likely a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Peaks corresponding to aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### Step 2: Analyze NMR Data
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a methine proton adjacent to an electronegative group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH2 group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH3 group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH3 group in an ethyl chain.

### Step 3: Determine the Structure of Compound X
- The para-substituted benzene ring suggests two substituents at opposite positions (1 and 4). 
- The 10.5 ppm peak and IR data indicate one substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
- The remaining substituent is a chain with a terminal CH3 group (0.9 ppm, t), a CH3 attached to a CH (1.4 ppm, d), and a CH group (2.9 ppm, m). This matches the structure of a sec-butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-).

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Step 4: Predict the Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, no further reaction occurs, and the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Options
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituents and positions do not match the NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not match the IR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the IR, NMR data, and is consistent with the reaction conditions.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not match the IR data.

### Final Answer
The compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, and it remains unchanged after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. 

Answer: C
