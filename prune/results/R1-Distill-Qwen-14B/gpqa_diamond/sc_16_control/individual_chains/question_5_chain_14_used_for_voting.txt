Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured. So eigenvectors are important because they give the states where the measurement is certain.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That looks like the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

So the operator P must be a vector operator, meaning P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz, where nx, ny, nz are the components of the unit vector n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, that means the y-component (ny) is zero. So n would be (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

The direction n is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of angles that parameterize this direction. Wait, perhaps spherical coordinates? But since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be zero because it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the eigenvector might not depend on φ if the direction is in the x-z plane. So perhaps the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of θ, the polar angle.

The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, no. Wait, P is the operator. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but P is a vector operator, so perhaps we need to find its matrix representation. Let me think about that. The operator P is given as a vector, and the components are given as matrices. So let's compute P for a general direction n in the x-z plane.

Since n is in x-z plane, ny = 0, so P = nx Px + 0 * Py + nz Pz.

So substituting the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P = nx (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside the brackets:

The first term is nx * [[0,1],[1,0]], so it becomes:

0  nx
nx  0

The second term is nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]], so it becomes:

nz  0
0  -nz

Adding them together, the matrix becomes:

[nz, nx]
[nx, -nz]

So the full P matrix is (ħ/2) times that. So:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

So now, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which simplifies to:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>

Because when you factor out (ħ/2), both sides divide by it, so the equation becomes:

[ nz  nx ] [a]   [a]
[ nx -nz ] [b] = [b]

So the matrix equation is:

[nz a + nx b] = a
[nx a - nz b] = b

So we have two equations:

1) nz a + nx b = a
2) nx a - nz b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

nz a + nx b = a → nz a = a - nx b → a (nz - 1) + nx b = 0
Similarly, equation 2:

nx a - nz b = b → nx a = (nz + 1) b → a = [(nz + 1)/nx ] b

Wait, but nx and nz are components of the unit vector in x-z plane, so nx² + nz² =1.

Let me substitute a from equation 2 into equation 1.

Equation 2: a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] b

Substituting into equation 1:

(nz -1 ) a + nx b =0 → (nz -1 ) [ (nz + 1 ) / nx ] b + nx b = 0

Let me factor out b:

[ (nz-1)(nz+1)/nx + nx ] b =0

Simplify the numerator:

(nz² -1 ) / nx + nx = [ (nz² -1) + nx² ] / nx

But since nx² + nz² =1, we can substitute nx² =1 -nz².

So (nz² -1) + (1 -nz²) = nz² -1 +1 -nz² = 0.

So the entire numerator becomes 0, so [0 / nx] =0.

Which means that the equation is 0*b=0, which is always true. So the two equations are dependent, and we can express a in terms of b.

So from equation 2: a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] b

But we can write the eigenvector in terms of b.

Let me choose b as a parameter, say, b=1 (since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple).

So a = (nz +1 ) / nx

But wait, the components a and b must form a normalizable vector. So the vector is [a, b] = [ (nz+1)/nx , 1 ]

But we need to normalize this vector. So the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So | (nz+1)^2 / nx² | + 1 =1 → | (nz+1)^2 / nx² | =0 → (nz+1)^2 =0 → nz = -1.

Wait, that can't be right because nx² + nz²=1. If nz =-1, then nx=0, but then the direction n would be along the negative z-axis.

But that's a specific case. Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So this suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the general case.

The eigenvector equation is [ nz a + nx b = a ] and [ nx a - nz b = b ]

Let me rearrange equation 1: (nz -1 ) a + nx b =0 → (1 - nz ) a = nx b → a = [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b

Similarly, equation 2: nx a = (nz +1 ) b → a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] b

Setting these two expressions for a equal: [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] b

Assuming b ≠0, we can divide both sides by b:

nx² / (1 - nz) = (nz +1 )

Multiply both sides by (1 - nz):

nx² = (nz +1)(1 - nz ) = 1 - nz²

But since nx² + nz² =1, 1 -nz² = nx², so indeed this holds. So the condition is satisfied.

So, the ratio a/b is given by either of the two expressions. Let's take a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (nz +1 ), nx ]^T.

Wait, wait, no. Because a is the first component, and b is the second. So the vector is [a, b] = [ (nz +1 )/nx * b, b ]

So let me factor out b:

[ (nz +1 )/nx , 1 ] * b

So the vector can be written as b * [ (nz +1 )/nx , 1 ]

But for normalization, the sum |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |(nz+1)^2 / nx² | + 1 = [ (nz+1)^2 + nx^2 ] / nx^2

Compute numerator:

(nz+1)^2 + nx^2 = nz² + 2 nz +1 + nx²

But nx² =1 - nz², so:

nz² + 2 nz +1 + (1 - nz²) = 2 + 2 nz.

So normalization factor squared is (2 + 2 nz)/(nx²).

Wait, no, because the denominator is nx², so the normalization factor is sqrt( (2 + 2 nz) ) / |nx|.

Wait, but since n is a direction vector, nx is a real number, and can be positive or negative. Let me assume that nx is positive, as direction vectors can be oriented either way.

Wait, but wait, for the muon spin, the direction n could be any direction in x-z, so perhaps the parameterization requires spherical coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is given by an angle θ from the z-axis.

Let me parameterize the direction as follows: since n is in the x-z plane, we can write it as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ (the azimuthal angle) is zero or π. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait, the standard spherical coordinates have polar angle θ from the positive z-axis, and φ as the azimuth. So for a direction in the x-z plane (i.e., in the plane spanned by x and z), φ can be 0 or π. So n would be (sinθ cos0, 0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the position vector is r sinθ cosφ x + r sinθ sinφ y + r cosθ z. So when y=0 (as in x-z plane), φ is 0 or π, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=π.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to write n as (nx, 0, nz) where nx² + nz² =1. So nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ? Wait no, that would place the direction at angle θ from the x-axis, but in the x-z plane. Alternatively, if I have θ measured from the z-axis, then nz = cosθ, and nx = sinθ, but that depends on convention.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to express nz and nx in terms of an angle θ measured from the z-axis. So for n in x-z plane, nz = cosθ, nx = sinθ, where θ is the angle from the positive z-axis.

So substituting nz = cosθ, nx = sinθ.

So now, the eigenvector components are a and b, where a = [(nz +1)/nx ] b.

Wait, but a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b.

So the vector is [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ , 1 ] times b.

But let's compute the normalization factor.

The normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So | ( (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ )^2 + 1 | =1.

Wait, but this is | [ (cosθ +1 )^2 + sin²θ ] / sin²θ | =1.

Compute numerator:

(cosθ +1 )^2 + sin²θ = cos²θ + 2 cosθ +1 + sin²θ

= (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2 cosθ +1

= 1 + 2 cosθ +1 = 2 (1 + cosθ )

So the normalization factor squared is [2(1 + cosθ)] / sin²θ.

So the normalization factor is sqrt( [2(1 + cosθ)] ) / |sinθ|.

But let's express this in terms of trigonometric identities. Note that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2 ), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

sqrt( 2 * 2 cos²(θ/2) ) / ( 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) )

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

|sinθ| = 2 |sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)|.

So normalization factor N:

N = sqrt(4 cos²(θ/2 )) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) )

sqrt(4 cos²(θ/2 )) is 2 |cos(θ/2)|. Assuming cos(θ/2) is positive, which it is for θ between 0 and π.

So N = (2 cos(θ/2 )) / ( 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

N = (2 cos(θ/2 )) ) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) ) = 1/(sin(θ/2 )) )

So N = 1/ sin(θ/2 )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a, b ] = [ ( (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ) * b, b ] * N

Wait, but since a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b, and b is a normalization parameter, perhaps it's better to set b= sin(θ/2 ), but let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the normalized vector in terms of θ/2.

Let me express the eigenvector as [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ , 1 ] multiplied by N, which is 1/ sin(θ/2 )

Hmm, let me compute each component:

First component:

(cosθ +1 ) / sinθ * N = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * (1 / sin(θ/2) )

But cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2 ), or cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2 ) -1.

Wait, let me use the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2 )

So cosθ +1 = 2 - 2 sin²(θ/2 ) = 2 (1 - sin²(θ/2 )) = 2 cos²(θ/2 )

And sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 )

So [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] = [ 2 cos²(θ/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 ) ] = cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ) = cot(θ/2 )

So the first component is cot(θ/2 ) * N, which is cot(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 )

Wait, but N is 1/sin(θ/2 ), so first component becomes cot(θ/2 ) * (1/sin(θ/2 )) = [cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ) ] * [ 1 / sin(θ/2 ) ] = cos(θ/2 ) / sin²(θ/2 )

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of θ/2.

Wait, considering that the spin-1/2 particle's eigenvectors for spin along a direction n can be written as ( cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ) for up states, and ( -i sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ) for down states, but since we're in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, but in the problem, the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is the up state.

Wait, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ would be 0, so e^{i φ} is 1. So the eigenvector would be ( cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) )

But wait, let's think again. For an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the spin-up state is often written as:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |→⟩ 

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the axes. Alternatively, the general spin-up state along a direction (nx, ny, nz) is given by:

( (1 + nz ) / sqrt(2(1 + nz )) , sqrt( (1 - nz )/(2(1 + nz )) ) e^{i φ} )

Wait, maybe I should recall the standard expression for the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors for spin along a direction with angles θ and φ are:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |↓⟩

Similarly, |-> = -i sin(θ/2) |↑⟩ + cos(θ/2) |↓⟩

Wait, but in this problem, the state is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so φ=0. So the state would be cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + sin(θ/2) |↓⟩.

Wait, but in the eigenbasis, the spin-up state along direction n would have components [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] for the spin-up state.

But wait, how does that relate to the eigenvector I was computing earlier?

In the earlier calculation, the normalized eigenvector came out as:

[ a, b ] = [ (cosθ +1 )/( sinθ ) * b, b ] multiplied by N.

Wait, but after normalization, using the N I found earlier, perhaps it simplifies to cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

Wait, let me try plugging some specific values for θ to see if it matches.

Let me take θ=0, so direction is along +z.

Then, nz=1, nx=0. Wait, but then from earlier, the matrix P would be (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the standard Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the eigenvector [1, 0], which is (1, 0), which is cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. So yes, that matches.

Another example: θ=90 degrees, so nz=0, nx=1.

Then, the direction is along +x. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be (0,1), but wait, let's see. No, wait, when direction is along x, the spin-up state is (0,1) for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, no, wait, the eigenstates for Px would be |+x> = (1,1)/√2 and |−x> = (1,-1)/√2. So |+x> is (1,1)/√2, which would correspond to θ=90 degrees (since direction is along x, so θ=90 degrees from z-axis).

Wait, but according to the general formula, the state would be [ cos(90/2 ), sin(90/2) ] = [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = (1/√2, 1/√2). Which matches the |+x> state. So that seems correct.

So the normalized eigenvector for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but wait, the options have other expressions. Let me check each option.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) → these have hbar, but eigenvectors are dimensionless; they should be unit vectors without hbar. So probably incorrect.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). This looks like a possible spherical harmonic, but for spin-1/2, it's more likely theta/2. So maybe not.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). This matches what I derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)) → includes hbar, which doesn't make sense for an eigenvector. It also has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which would imply a specific direction, but the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction. So maybe this is for a specific θ, but the question is about the general case. So option D doesn't look correct.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the eigenvector must be expressed in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ (measured from the z-axis) and the azimuthal angle $\phi = 0$ (as $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane).

The operator $\vec{P}$ can be written as:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the given components $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Simplifying, the eigenvector components satisfy:

\[
\begin{cases}
n_z a + n_x b = a, \\
n_x a - n_z b = b.
\end{cases}
\]

From these equations, the ratio $a/b$ is determined as:

\[
a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b.
\]

Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the eigenvector components become:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

The eigenvector is then:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalization requires:

\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \implies \left|\cot(\theta/2)\right|^2 + 1 = 1.
\]

Using $\cot(\theta/2) = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)}$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the general form of the spin-up state for a spin-1/2 particle along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for normalized eigenvectors.  
- **Option B**: Uses $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$, which are inconsistent with the spin-1/2 eigenvector structure.  
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.  
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and specific coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not general and inconsistent with the arbitrary direction.

The correct answer is **Option C**.
