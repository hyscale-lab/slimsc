Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about a star with some specific properties. Let me read it again carefully. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N2/N1 is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The ratio depends on the temperature. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature changes, right? But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. But I'm not sure if that's the temperature of the entire photosphere or if the spots are cooler regions. Oh, the question states that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think the photosphere's average temperature is lower.

So, the star without spots has Teff = 6000 K. When there are spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, wait, spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the spots have a lower temperature, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Or is the entire photosphere after spots at 5500 K? Hmm, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So probably, the average of the entire surface is lower, implying that some parts are spots at lower T and others are normal.

Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can model this as two regions: the spotted area and the unspotted area. When the star has spots, 40% of the surface is spots, with some lower temperature T_spot, and 60% is at 6000 K. But the total effective temperature of the star is 5500 K.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that when the spots are present, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So the average temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. But that might not be the case because the spots are cooler and the rest is hotter? Or are they just lower?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and when the spots are present, the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler, so the rest would be hotter. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, maybe the spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the star is at the original 6000 K. So the overall effective temperature would be a combination of the two areas. Let me think: the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. The luminosity is the sum of the contributions from each area.

Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ T^4 (where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant). So the total luminosity when there are spots would be the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Let me denote:

- Fraction of surface with spots: f = 0.4.

- Surface area without spots: (1-f) = 0.6.

Let T_spot be the temperature of the spots, and T_unspotted = 6000 K.

The total luminosity when spots are present is L = L_unspotted + L_spots.

L_unspotted = (1-f) * 4π R² σ (T_unspotted)^4.

L_spots = f * 4π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

The observed total effective temperature T_eff when spots are present is 5500 K.

Wait, but the effective temperature is calculated as the temperature of a black body with the same total surface area and luminosity. So the luminosity when spots are present is equal to 4π R² σ (T_eff')^4, where T_eff' is 5500 K.

So, setting up the equation:

(1-f) (6000)^4 + f (T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

Then, I can plug in f = 0.4.

So,

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

Wait, wait, no. Because the area without spots is 0.6 of the total surface, but the luminosity from each part is proportional to area times T^4. So yes.

Let me compute each term numerically.

Compute (6000)^4: 6e3^4 = (6^4)*(1e3)^4) = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, (5500)^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4 is 5.5*5.5=30.25, squared again: 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So:

0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Compute 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 0.7776e15.

So,

0.7776e15 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Rearranging,

0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 - 0.7776e15.

Wait, 0.7776e15 is 7.776e14.

So,

0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = (9.150625 -7.776) e14 = 1.374625e14.

Then, T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

So T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, take the fourth root. Let me think about the approximate value. 1e14 is 10^14.

Let me compute:

(3.4365625e14)^(1/4) = (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4).

1e14^(1/4) is (1e3.5)^ (1/2) ? Wait, no, 1e14 is 10^14, so (10^14)^(1/4) = 10^(3.5) = 10^3 * 10^0.5 ≈ 1000 * 3.162 ≈ 3162.

Now 3.4365625^(1/4). Let's compute that. The fourth root of 3.43656 is approximately 1.36, since 1.36^4 is about 3.43 (1.36^2 = 1.8496, squared again is about 3.418).

So T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 3162 ≈ 4313 K.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because when spots cover 40% of the surface, the T_spot is 4313 K, which is significantly lower than the original 6000 K. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 0.6*(6000^4) +0.4*(T_spot^4) = 5500^4.

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12.

5.5 squared is 30.25, squared again is 915.0625. So 5.5^4 = 915.0625, so 5500^4 is 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

Then, 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So,

7.776e14 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract 7.776e14: 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

Then, 0.4 T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14.

T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Now, take the fourth root.

So, the fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Let me compute this more accurately. Let me first write 3.4365625e14 as 3.4365625 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = 1e(14/4) )= 1e3.5 = 3162.27766 ≈ 3162.28.

The fourth root of 3.4365625 is approximately 1.36, as I thought earlier.

So, T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 3162.28 ≈ 4313. 4 K.

Wait, that seems quite a bit lower than 5500 K. But perhaps that's correct, considering the spots are cooler and a large fraction of the surface is spotted.

But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So that's the effective temperature of the entire star, which is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas. So the calculation seems correct.

So now, back to the main question. The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, which level is higher? E2 is higher than E1, because when you go from level 1 to level 2, you're moving to a higher energy state. So E2 > E1.

The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) → N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation is N_j/N_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So if j is level 2 and i is level 1, then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when the temperature T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, making the exponential larger, so N2/N1 increases.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so the ratio N2/N1 would decrease, because the exponential factor gets smaller.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, T is lower, and N2/N1 is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher than when it has spots (T=5500 K).

The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots.

Which would be [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]

Wait, but wait, actually, the denominator would be when the star has spots, which is lower T. So the denominator is (N2/N1)_T=5500.

So the ratio is [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ].

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out.

So it becomes exp[ ( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) + ( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Hmm, let's compute that exponent.

Let me denote ΔE = E2 - E1.

So exponent = ΔE/k [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

Compute the difference in the reciprocal temperatures:

1/5500 ≈ 1.81818e-4 K^-1

1/6000 ≈ 1.66667e-4 K^-1

Difference: (1.81818e-4 - 1.66667e-4) = 0.15151e-4 K^-1 = 1.5151e-5 K^-1.

So exponent = ΔE/(k) * 1.5151e-5.

But wait, I don't know ΔE. Oh wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms, or 1.448e-6 meters.

Wait, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, and λ wavelength.

So ΔE = hc/λ.

So let's compute ΔE.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 meters.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But converting J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/k = (8.56 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) / (1.38e-23 J/K )

Compute that:

8.56 * 1.602e-19 = approx 13.71e-19 J.

Divide by 1.38e-23 J/K: (13.71e-19) / (1.38e-23) = (13.71 / 1.38) ) * 1e4 ≈ 9.93 * 1e4 = 9.93e4 K.

Wait, so ΔE/k ≈ 9.93e4 K.

So going back to the exponent: (ΔE/k) * 1.5151e-5 K^-1.

Wait, no, the exponent is (ΔE/k) multiplied by (1/5500 - 1/6000) ), which is in units of 1/K. So (ΔE/k) [K] * (1/K) → unitless, as it should be for the exponent.

So (9.93e4 K) * (1.5151e-5 1/K ) = 9.93e4 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ (9.93 * 1.5151) ) * 1e-1.

Compute 9.93 *1.5151: approx 15.05.

So 15.05 * 0.1 = 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the ratio factor is exp(1.505) ≈ ?

Exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

I know that e^1 = 2.718, e^1.6 ≈ 4.953. Let's compute e^1.505.

Let me approximate:

We can use the Taylor expansion around 1.5:

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

Since 1.505 is 0.005 above 1.5, the increase can be approximated as e^1.5 * (1 + 0.005 + (0.005)^2/2 + ... )

But 0.005 is small, so e^0.005 ≈ 1 + 0.005 + 0.0000125 ≈ 1.0050125.

So e^1.505 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.005 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0050125 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.0050125) ≈ 4.4817 + ~0.02246 → approx 4.504.

Alternatively, using calculator-like approach:

Let me think, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817, as I said. e^0.005 ≈ 1.0050125.

So product: 4.4817 * 1.0050125.

4 * 1.005=4.02. 0.4817 * 1.005 ≈ 0.4841.

So total approx 4.02 + 0.4841 = 4.5041. So about 4.504.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the exponent calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the exponent's calculation.

Wait, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Earlier, I calculated (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1.515e-5 1/K.

Then, (ΔE/k) is 9.93e4 K.

So 9.93e4 K * 1.515e-5 1/K = 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 * 1.515) * (1e4 * 1e-5) ) → (15.05) * (0.1) = 1.505.

That's correct.

So the exponent is about 1.505, so the factor is e^1.505≈4.5.

So the ratio increases by a factor of about 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}.
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the Expression
The statistical weights \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_{\text{with spots}}}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{(8.56 \, \text{eV})(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV})}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 9.93 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Exponent
The difference in reciprocal temperatures is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.1515 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (9.93 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.505.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the Factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
