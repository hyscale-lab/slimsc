Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit, and where it's positioned geometrically in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because when I remember the general form for a density matrix, a mixed state with equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩ would have ρ = p|0⟩⟨0| + (1-p)|1⟩⟨1|, right? And here, p is 1/2 for both, so it's maximally mixed.

But wait, the question is about its geometrical position. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh, right! The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. For pure states, the state is on the surface of the sphere. For mixed states, it's inside.

The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For a mixed state, you take a statistical mixture, like a convex combination of pure states. The given ρ is an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, so it should be represented by a point inside the Bloch sphere.

But how exactly? I remember that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). The length of r determines how mixed the state is. If r is zero, the state is maximally mixed (like ρ = I/2), and if |r|=1, it's a pure state on the equator of the Bloch sphere.

So, let's compute it. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element is ½.

So ρ is:
[ [½, 0],
  [0, ½] ]

Which is the same as the identity matrix multiplied by ½. Because the identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is exactly this.

Wait, but the identity matrix as a density matrix implies a completely mixed state. So the Bloch vector r must be zero because when r is zero, the density matrix becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is exactly our ρ.

So the position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. But wait, the options are in the form of r = (x,y,z). So yeah, if r is (0,0,0), that's option C.

Let me double-check. Another way: the density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and I. The general form is ρ = (I + aσx + bσy + cσz)/2. Here, our ρ is (I)/2, so a = b = c = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (a, b, c) = (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin. That's option C.

So the correct answer should be option C, which is r=(0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the probabilities of the qubit being in states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are equal. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \(r\) is related to the density matrix through the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(r = (a, b, c)\) is a 3D vector. For a maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \(r\) is zero because the density matrix simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), with no contribution from the Pauli matrices.

The given density matrix explicitly matches \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which corresponds to \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.
