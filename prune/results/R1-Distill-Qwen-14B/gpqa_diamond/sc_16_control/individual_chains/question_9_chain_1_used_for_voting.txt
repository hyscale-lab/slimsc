Okay, so I have this question about determining which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but let's think through this.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. C3h is one of the point group symmetries in molecular geometry. I think the C3h point group includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and maybe some other reflections or rotations. Or wait, more accurately, C3h consists of a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane. So any molecule with this symmetry should have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror that leaves the molecule looking the same.

Let me look at the options given. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Wait, the question is which of these molecules has C3h symmetry. So I need to figure out the symmetry of each.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. I recall that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is at the center with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are -CH(CH3)2, so each is a substituent. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron. Wait, but wait, each isopropyl group is bulky but symmetric. The molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry, which suggests a C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the molecule is planar around B, so maybe the mirror plane lies in the plane of the boron and the three isopropyl groups. So yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in that plane. Also, a three-fold rotation axis (C3) would allow the molecule to be superimposed when rotated 120 degrees around that axis. So C3h symmetry would fit here.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with three identical substituents. That suggests a D3h symmetry perhaps? Because D3h includes a C3 axis, three vertical σ planes, a horizontal σ plane, etc. Hmm, but the question is about C3h, which is a lower symmetry than D3h. So maybe triisopropyl borate is D3h, which would have more symmetry elements. So maybe option C isn't the right answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think again. C3h symmetry would include a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So if a molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis, that's C3h. For example, molecules like benzene have D6h, but something like propellane might have C3h.

Wait, or maybe I'm mixing up some point groups. Let me recall: C3h has a C3 axis and a σh plane, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So any molecule that has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis would belong to C3h.

So, for triisopropyl borate, the structure is trigonal planar, with three substituents arranged symmetrically. So yes, it has a C3 axis (since you can rotate it 120 degrees and it looks the same), and a horizontal mirror plane in the plane of the boron and the substituents. So the molecule has a C3h symmetry. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be D3h. What's the difference between C3h and D3h?

D3h has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and also three perpendicular C2 axes and other planes. So D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. So if the molecule has more symmetry elements than just C3 and σh, then it would be D3h, not C3h.

Triisopropyl borate: does it have any other symmetry elements apart from C3 and σh? Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is planar with three identical groups attached to B. Each group is isopropyl, which is symmetric. So, any line through the boron and a substituent would be a C2 axis? No, wait, if you rotate 180 degrees around that axis, would the molecule look the same? Let me think. Suppose I pick a line through B and one of the isopropyl groups. If I rotate 180 degrees, does the molecule look the same? Each substituent is symmetric, but looking at the arrangement, all three substituents are identical, so perhaps such a rotation would swap substituents. Wait, actually, if all three substituents are identical, then any rotation of 120 degrees would bring the molecule back to itself, but would a 180-degree rotation around a line perpendicular to the plane (like the C3 axis) do anything?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has three planes of symmetry that pass through the boron and each substituent. If that's the case, then it would have those C2 axes, making it D3h instead. So perhaps the triisopropyl borate actually has D3h symmetry, which includes more symmetry elements than just C3h.

So if that's the case, then option C isn't the correct answer, because the question is about C3h symmetry, not D3h.

Moving on to option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with the structure of a norbornane. Its structure is a bridge bicyclic system, which gives it a certain symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a C2h symmetry. Wait, or maybe C2v? Wait, no. Let's think about it. Quinuclidine has a structure where a seven-membered ring is bridged, making it a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the bridge. So perhaps it has a C2 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C2h symmetry. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, another source I recall says quinuclidine has a C2v symmetry because of a vertical mirror plane and a twofold rotation. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I'm pretty sure it's not C3h. Because quinuclidine is bridged with two methyl groups or something similar? Wait, no, quinuclidine's structure is more like a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. So perhaps it has a C2 axis and a σh plane, making it C2h. So C2h would be different from C3h, so option D is out.

Now option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the name. It's a benzo-fused trifuran with multiple ketone groups. The numbering suggests that the benzene ring is fused to the trifuran system in certain positions.

Wait, perhaps it would help to imagine the structure. Trifuran is a furan tricyclic system, but benzo might add a benzene ring fused to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic system with three fused furan rings and a benzene ring. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think the structure of benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran would have a benzene ring fused to three furan rings in a specific way.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. Let me think about the symmetry. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis with a horizontal mirror plane. So, if the molecule has a central trigonal arrangement with a mirror plane, it might qualify.

Alternatively, benzo-based systems often have certain symmetry, but I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the molecule is symmetric with threefold rotational symmetry. For example, if the structure has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, the name has 'trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone', which suggests that each of those positions is a ketone. So the molecule would have six ketone groups, perhaps in a symmetric pattern.

Wait, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... I'm trying to visualize the structure. Maybe it's a benzene ring fused to three furan rings in a way that creates a symmetric molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to a three-fold rotation axis. If that's the case, and there's a horizontal mirror plane, then it would belong to C3h.

Alternatively, another approach: sometimes, certain polycyclic compounds, like hexa-substituted systems with multiple rings, can exhibit C3h symmetry. For example, if the molecule has a central three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Hmm, but without a clear image, this is tricky. Let me think about if any of the other options seem more likely.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a similar structure, perhaps a larger system with three benzene rings attached to a trifuran core. Triphenylene suggests three benzene rings connected in a symmetrical arrangement.

Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings fused in a triangular arrangement. Triphenylene has a C3h symmetry because it has a three-fold rotation axis in the center, and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Wait a second, triphenylene has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if the molecule in option A is a triphenylene fused with a trifuran system, perhaps it retains the C3h symmetry. Alternatively, the addition of the trifuran might disrupt that symmetry.

But the name is triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So it's a triphenylene fused to a trifuran, which might lead to a molecule with a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, but the core is the trifuran. So let's suppose that the triphenylene part is attached in a symmetric fashion. If each phenyl group is attached at positions that are 120 degrees apart around a central axis, then the molecule would have a C3 rotation axis. Plus, if there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, then C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule in option A has a higher symmetry than C3h, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option B is more likely to have C3h symmetry. Let me think again: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So the benzene is fused to three furan rings in a way that the substituents might be arranged symmetrically.

Wait, if the benzene ring is fused to three furan rings such that each of the three positions on the benzene is connected to a furan ring, that could create a structure with three-fold symmetry.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring; I'm not sure how that would fit. Alternatively, perhaps the fusion leads to a system where the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, but without a horizontal mirror plane, so it would be C3, not C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for other options.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So among the options, I need to find which one has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

I remember that triphenylene itself (without the trifuran) has C3h symmetry. So if option A is triphenyleno attached to a trifuran, perhaps the overall structure retains that C3h symmetry. Or maybe the addition of the trifuran alters the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is a benzo-fused structure that doesn't have three-fold symmetry but a different one.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So looking for a structure that's symmetric with three parts arranged around a central point.

Looking back, triisopropyl borate (option C) is trigonal planar, which has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But earlier I thought it might have D3h symmetry, which includes more elements, but maybe it's just C3h. Because in D3h, you would have additional planes and axes, like three vertical mirror planes. Does triisopropyl borate have those?

Wait, if all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then any line through the center and a substituent would be a mirror plane. So yes, it would have three vertical mirror planes. So in that case, the symmetry would be D3h, not C3h. So option C isn't the correct answer.

So the other candidate is option A or B.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Structure-wise, if the benzene is fused to the trifuran in a way that creates three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, if the substituents on the benzene are arranged in a way that each is 120 degrees apart, then it would have a three-fold symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A, triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If the triphenylene part is connected symmetrically, then the overall molecule would have C3h.

Wait, but triphenylene has three benzene rings in a triangular arrangement, so perhaps the molecule in option A is a larger system with that symmetry.

Alternatively, another approach: the question is about which one of these has C3h symmetry. Let me think about common examples.

Triphenylene has C3h symmetry. If option A is based on triphenylene, then it might have that symmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule is triphenylene with trifuran added symmetrically, maybe the symmetry is preserved.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option B is a derivative where the substituents are arranged symmetrically but not necessarily in a way that includes a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in C3h means that the molecule must be planar in that plane. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that is horizontal (like a plane cutting through the molecule such that one half is a mirror image of the other), then it would have σh.

So, for example, in triphenylene, the plane that is perpendicular to the three-fold rotation axis and bisects the molecule into two mirror-image halves would be the σh plane.

So if option A is a triphenylene core with a trifuran attached symmetrically, it's likely to have that C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that disrupts the mirror plane, then symmetry would be lower.

But without the exact structures, it's challenging. However, from the options given, I think the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought triphenylene has C3h symmetry. So if option A is a triphenylene-fused structure, it might have that symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is not symmetric enough because of the way the benzene is fused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other options again.

Option D, quinuclidine: I think it has a C2h symmetry, so no.

Option C, triisopropyl borate: D3h, so no.

So between options A and B.

Option B's structure is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. The numbering seems to indicate that the benzene is fused to three furan rings at specific positions. Perhaps the arrangement of the substituents leads to a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, leading to a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, the hexaone part in option B suggests that there are six ketone groups. So maybe each of the three furan rings has two ketones, which might complicate the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the ketones is symmetric in a way that preserves C3h.

But without the exact structure, it's a bit hard. However, I think the correct answer is option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, but why? Because triphenylene itself has C3h. So if triphenylene is part of the structure, perhaps it brings that symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is either option A or B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the name of option A includes triphenyleno, which suggests that three benzene rings are attached. If those are symmetrically attached, then the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, hence C3h.

So, putting it all together, the molecule with triphenylene (option A) likely has a C3h symmetry. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but then the options are labeled as A, B, C, D. Looking back, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So based on the reasoning that triphenylene has C3h, and if option A is a triphenylene derivative with that symmetry, then the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another angle: the substituents in option A are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. That might not necessarily disrupt the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps looking for C3h symmetry, the only molecule that fits is option A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

C3h symmetry implies that the molecule can be divided by a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, after a 120-degree rotation, the molecule looks the same, and it's also symmetric with respect to a horizontal plane.

So, for a molecule to have C3h, it must have three identical parts arranged around a central axis, and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Looking at option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is a three-fused benzene rings. Each benzene is connected to a central point, so the arrangement is symmetric. If the trifuran is attached symmetrically, the overall molecule would retain the three-fold symmetry and the horizontal mirror plane. So option A would have C3h.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but earlier I thought it's D3h.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure, which is C3v symmetry. Because trigonal planar has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes, making it D3h. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is D3h. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I'll have to go with my first thought that the triphenylene-based molecule in option A has C3h symmetry. Therefore, the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which together ensure that the molecule looks identical after a 120° rotation and reflection across the horizontal plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule is based on a triphenylene core, which is a system of three benzene rings fused in a triangular arrangement. Triphenylene itself is known to have **C₃h** symmetry due to its three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.
- The addition of the trifuran system must be symmetric for the overall molecule to retain **C₃h** symmetry. If the trifuran is fused in a way that preserves the three-fold rotational symmetry and the horizontal mirror plane, the molecule will remain in the **C₃h** point group.
- Based on the name, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, suggesting that the molecule retains **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzene ring is fused to three furan rings in a specific pattern.
- For **C₃h** symmetry to exist, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. However, the fusion pattern of the benzene and furan rings in this case does not clearly indicate the presence of a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane.
- The arrangement of the substituents and the overall structure suggest that this molecule is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
- Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), it also has three vertical mirror planes, which elevate its symmetry to **D₃h** rather than **C₃h**.
- Since **C₃h** symmetry requires only a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, this molecule does not fit the criteria.

#### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a norbornane-like structure. Its symmetry is characterized by a **C₂h** point group, which includes a two-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
- This molecule does not have a three-fold rotation axis, so it cannot exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The molecule in **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) is the most likely to have **C₃h** symmetry. The triphenylene core provides the three-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane, and the symmetric fusion of the trifuran system preserves this symmetry.

**Answer: A**
