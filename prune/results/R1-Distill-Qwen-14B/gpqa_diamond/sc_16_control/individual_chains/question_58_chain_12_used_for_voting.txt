Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I need to understand what regularization is. From what I remember, regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with infinities that appear in loop calculations. It's a way to make the calculations mathematically meaningful by introducing a temporary (or 'regularizing') cutoff, and then later removing it with renormalization. So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this step at high energies.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, right? It doesn't just apply to high energies but is a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. String theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same divergences that other quantum field theories have. Because strings have size scales smaller than the Planck length, maybe they don't need the same kind of regularization? Or perhaps because they're background-dependent, but I'm not entirely sure. Another point: string theories are supposed to be perturbatively finite, but I'm not certain if that means they never require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. I remember that QCD does require renormalization because of the infinities that come up in loop diagrams. So it must need regularization as part of the process, but wait, does it require it at high energies? Well, QCD is asymptotically free, so at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling becomes weak. So loop corrections are smaller, but I think you still need regularization regardless. I'm a bit confused here because without regularization, the perturbative calculations would be problematic. But since QCD is a renormalizable theory, maybe it still requires it. So option B is probably not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-tested theory, and I know that it does require renormalization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's mass and charge, where infinities appear and are handled via renormalization. So regularization is a necessary step here. So option C isn't the answer either.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the classical theory, not the quantum version. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences as quantum field theories because they don't have the issues with virtual particles or loop diagrams. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you might have singularities at point charges, but that's more about the mathematical model rather than physical infinities in calculations. So in the classical theory, you don't need regularization because you're not doing the same kind of perturbative expansions with divergent integrals. So this might be the correct answer.

Wait a minute, let me double-check. The question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So if a theory doesn't have the divergences in the first place, it doesn't need regularization. So which of these theories is free from such divergences?

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and QCD are both quantum field theories and hence require regularization. Superstring theory is also a quantum theory, but maybe it's formulated in a way that doesn't require the same kind of regularization as others, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since it's a background-independent theory, perhaps it avoids some of these problems.

Wait, but I thought that even string theories require some form of regularization when dealing with certain aspects, but perhaps they are finite in a different way. Alternatively, maybe in the high-energy limit, superstring theory doesnâ€™t require it because it's a different framework. Or maybe the question is pointing towards the fact that classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same infinities.

So the only option that is a classical theory is D, so it doesn't require regularization. The other options are quantum theories that do need regularization.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their characteristics and the role of regularization in quantum field theory. Regularization is a technique used to handle infinities that arise in loop calculations, particularly in quantum field theories. The question asks for the theory that does not encounter such infinities and thus never requires regularization.

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring theory is a quantum theory that aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is distinct from standard quantum field theories because it incorporates strings as fundamental entities rather than point particles. While superstring theory is finite and avoids some of the divergences seen in other quantum field theories, it still requires regularization in certain contexts, such as when dealing with loop corrections. Therefore, it does require regularization at high energies.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and a non-abelian gauge theory. It is a renormalizable theory, meaning it requires renormalization to handle infinities in loop calculations. Although QCD is asymptotically free and becomes weaker at high energies, it still needs regularization as part of the renormalization process. Thus, it requires regularization at high energies.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is the theory of electromagnetism and a well-established quantum field theory. It is also renormalizable, and infinities appear in loop calculations, necessitating regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QED requires regularization at high energies.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical electrodynamics is a classical theory based on Maxwell's equations. Unlike quantum field theories, it does not involve loop diagrams or quantum infinities. While it may have mathematical singularities (e.g., at point charges), these are not addressed through regularization. Since classical theories do not require regularization in the same sense as quantum field theories, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization at high energies.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, only classical electrodynamics is a theory that does not require regularization at high energies. The other options are quantum field theories or string theories, which do require regularization in their respective frameworks.
