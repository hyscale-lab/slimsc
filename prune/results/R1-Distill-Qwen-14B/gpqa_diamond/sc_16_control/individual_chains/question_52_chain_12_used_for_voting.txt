Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). Observers notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. Okay, so first, I need to recall how the ratio of populations in two energy levels is determined. Oh right, in LTE, the ratio n1/n2 is given by the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower. Let me think: when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature goes down. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? Or are the spots at a lower temperature than the surrounding, so the average Teff would be lower?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's overall emission is lower when spots are present. So without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K.

But wait, the effective temperature is a sort of average. So the star's total luminosity is the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted areas. But the problem doesn't give us the temperature of the spots. Hmm, but maybe I don't need that information. Because the question is about the photospheric ratio. Wait, the problem says "in the stellar photosphere". Oh, so are the spots part of the photosphere, but at a lower temperature?

So when the star has spots, parts of the photosphere are cooler. So the total photosphere is not at a uniform temperature anymore. So for the purpose of the problem, when calculating the ratio of Ti atoms in energy levels, each part of the photosphere (spotted and unspotted) has a different temperature. But how does this affect the overall ratio?

Wait, but the problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots (40% coverage), the observed ratio n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots (n1/n2 is higher when no spots). So the question is: when no spots, what's the ratio compared to when spots are present.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. The problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots. Therefore, the ratio with no spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

But wait, how do spots affect the observed ratio? Spots are cooler, so in the spotted regions, the temperature is lower than 6000 K. But the unspotted regions are at 6000 K if no spots, but when spots are present, the overall photosphere is at 5500 K? Wait, no, that's not right. Because the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So perhaps the star's average temperature is lower, but the unspotted areas are still at 6000 K, and the spotted areas are at some lower temperature T_spot.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. So the star's photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the photosphere of the star as a whole has a lower effective temperature. But each region (spot and non-spot) contributes to the overall emission.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of Ti in two energy levels. The measurement would be an average, weighted by the emission from each region. So the observed ratio would be a combination of the ratios from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at an average temperature when spots are present. Wait, but that's not correct, because the temperature structure would have variations. Hmm, but the question says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider the star as a two-component blackbody: 60% of the surface at 6000 K, and 40% at a lower temperature, T_spot. Then the total luminosity would be L = 0.6 * L_6000 + 0.4 * L_T_spot. And the effective temperature is given by L = 4πR² σ Teff^4. So maybe I can calculate T_spot based on this.

But wait, the problem doesn't require knowing T_spot, but rather the effect on the Ti level ratio. So perhaps I can model the observed ratio as a combination of the two regions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at the average Teff of 5500 K when spots are present. But that's an approximation. But I think that's not the case because the observed line ratio would be a blend of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the photosphere is at a lower average temperature, but the individual regions' temperatures are what contribute to the line ratio.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the assumption is that the temperature of the photosphere is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots. But that might not be correct because the presence of spots would only cover 40% of the surface, so the majority (60%) remains at 6000 K. Hmm, perhaps the approach is to model the situation as an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star as having a certain effective temperature, and the line formation is happening in a region where the temperature affects the ionization and excitation of Ti.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of spots affects the average temperature of the photosphere in such a way that the excitation of the Ti atoms changes. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature as a whole is lower. So the average ratio n1/n2 would be lower because the temperature is lower.

Wait, but the ratio n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponential term increases because (E2 - E1) is positive. So if E2 > E1, which it is because level 2 is higher energy, then as T decreases, the denominator kT becomes smaller, so the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp() becomes smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive.

As T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is more negative. Therefore, the exponential term becomes smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(...) becomes smaller.

So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. That's why when spots are present, the ratio decreases, as observed.

So without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, the effective T is 5500 K. So the ratio when no spots is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ), and when spots are present, it's (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ). So the factor is [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/(5500) - 1/(6000)] ) )

Wait, let's compute the exponent.

Let me denote ΔE = E2 - E1.

So the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) )

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000:

Find a common denominator, which is 5500*6000 = 33,000,000.

So 1/5500 = 6000 / 33,000,000 = 6000/33e6 = 6/(33e3) = approx 0.0001818.

1/6000 = 5500/33,000,000 = 5500/33e6 = 55/(33e3) = 0.0016666... / 1000? Wait, maybe better to compute as 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 and 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667.

So 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001513.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * 0.00001513.

But wait, what's ΔE? The transition is at 1448 Å, which is about 1448 Angstroms. Let's compute the energy difference from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.
λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) 

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

Compute 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373. So E ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, we use energy in terms of kT. So perhaps it's better to compute (ΔE)/(k) in terms of (k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K).

So (ΔE) is about 8.57 eV. Let's convert that to Joules.

8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.372e-18 J.

So, (ΔE)/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.372e-18)/(1.38e-23) ≈ approx 1e5. Let me compute it precisely.

1.372 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995, and 1e-18 / 1e-23 = 1e5.

So 0.995e5 ≈ 99500 ≈ 1e5.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that's a very large number. Because 1e5 K is way higher than the temperatures involved (6000 K and 5500 K).

So the exponent is: (1e5 K) * 0.00001513 (per K) → 1e5 * 1.513e-5 ≈ 1.513.

So the exponent is approximately 1.513.

So the factor is exp(1.513) ≈ e^1.513 ≈ approximately e^1.5 is about 4.48, and e^1.513 is a bit more. Let me compute:

e^1.5 = 4.4817.

e^1.513: Let's compute the difference. 1.513 is 1.5 +0.013.

The Taylor expansion for e^x around x=1.5: e^(1.5 + δ) ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + δ + δ²/2) where δ=0.013.

So δ=0.013, so:

≈4.4817 * [1 + 0.013 + (0.013)^2/2] 

Compute 0.013^2 = 0.000169, /2 = 0.0000845.

So 1 +0.013 +0.0000845 = 1.0130845.

Multiply by 4.4817: 4.4817 * 1.0130845 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.0130845)

Compute 4.4817 * 0.013 = ~0.05826, and 4.4817 *0.0000845≈0.000379.

Total ≈0.05826 +0.000379 = 0.05864.

So 4.4817 +0.05864 = ~4.5403.

So the factor is approximately 4.54, which is around 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let's double-check. Did I compute the exponent correctly?

The exponent was (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (1e5 K) * (approx 0.00001513 1/K) = 1.513.

Wait, that's correct.

So the factor is e^1.513 ≈4.54.

So the answer should be option C, ~4.5.

But wait, in the problem statement, the ratio n1/n2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So n1/n2 without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/5500 -1/6000) ) 

Which we've computed as ~4.5.

So the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning the temperature of the photosphere is lower in the spotted case. Without spots, the effective temperature is \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and with spots, it is \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \(E_2 - E_1 \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}\).

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right),
\]

where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). First, calculate \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Finding a common denominator (\(5500 \times 6000 = 33,000,000\)):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} = \frac{6000}{33,000,000}, \quad \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{5500}{33,000,000}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{33,000,000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 0.00001513 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, calculate \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k}\):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.57 \, \text{eV}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \times \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}}{1} \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1.513 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (1.513 \times 10^5) \times (0.00001513) \approx 1.513.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.513) \approx 4.54.
\]

### Conclusion
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
