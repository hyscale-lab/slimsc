Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think. So if stars are uniformly distributed, that means their actual number density is constant in space. But when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax changes because of the geometry involved.

Wait a minute, I think parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by the formula p = 1/d (in parsecs, I think). So as d increases, p decreases. Since stars are spread uniformly, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell. The surface area is 4πd², right? So for a tiny thickness dr, the number of stars would be 4πd² * (number density) * dr.

But we need to relate this to parallax. Let's see, if p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So dr is the change in distance, and we can write dr in terms of dp. Let's see: dr = (d/dp)(1/p) dp. The derivative of 1/p is -1/p², so dr = (-1/p²) dp. Hmm, since p is positive, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, we're looking at a range of p, so perhaps the negative will just flip the direction, but the magnitude is what matters.

So the number of stars in a range of parallax from p to p+dp would depend on how many stars are within that corresponding distance shell. Let's consider a small change in p, dp. The corresponding change in d is dr = (-1/p²) dp, but since we're looking for a small range, the negative just tells us the direction, but the magnitude is what we'll use. So let's think of it as dr = (1/p²) dp because we'll take the absolute value to find the number.

Now, the number of stars in that shell (d to d+dr) is N = 4πd² (n) dr, where n is the number density. But since d = 1/p, substituting that in: N = 4π (1/p)^2 * n * (1/p²) dp. Wait, hold on. Let me redo that substitution.

So d is 1/p, so d squared is (1/p)^2 = 1/p². And dr is (1/p²) dp, as we found. So plugging into N:

N = 4π (1/p²) * n * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, that would be 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So looking at N as a function of p, it's proportional to 1/p^4. So the number density in terms of p would fall off as 1/p^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in terms of volume, each shell has 4πd² dr. If d is 1/p, then d² is 1/p², and dr is 1/p² dp. So when you multiply them, it's 1/p^4. That seems right.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of the distribution of stars in space and how they project onto the parallax axis. Since more distant stars have smaller parallaxes, and the volume element (which relates to the number of stars) depends on d² dr, which then translates into 1/p^4 when expressed in terms of p.

So the number of stars per unit parallax range (like per parsec of p) should decrease as 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A, which says ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \), multiplied by the thickness of the shell, \( dr \).

To relate this to parallax, we express \( d \) in terms of \( p \): \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). The thickness of the shell in terms of \( p \) is found using \( dr = \left| \frac{dr}{dp} \right| dp = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we get:

\[
N \propto 4\pi d^2 \cdot dr \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp \propto \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
