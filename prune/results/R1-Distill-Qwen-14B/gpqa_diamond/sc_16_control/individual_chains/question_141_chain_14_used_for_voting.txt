Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's para-bromobenzene with a deuterium substitution. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2.

Wait, no, wait. 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so the numbering is such that the bromine is on position 1 (so the benzene ring is numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., in a circle), and position 2 has a deuterium. So the deuterium is adjacent to the bromine. Or wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring: position 1 is the bromine, and position 2 is the deuterium. So they are adjacent—like, the bromine and deuterium are on adjacent carbons.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh right, that's a strong base. I remember that NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially elimination reactions. But wait, when dealing with aromatic halides, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene? Or is it a substitution?

Wait, another thought: benzene rings with substituents can undergo various reactions. Bromine is a leaving group, so perhaps an elimination reaction where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms. But benzene is aromatic, so the ring is stable. Wait, but wait, the ring can't lose aromaticity. Oh, but in this case, maybe it's a di-elimination to form a di-substituted alkene or something else? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, leading to a ring contraction? Wait, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Another possibility is that the deuterium is part of a hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Wait, but the reaction is in a basic ammonia environment. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: benzene rings can undergo elimination via the formation of a benzyn intermediate. Oh right! That's when a dihalobenzene loses two halides and forms a triple bond, but wait, that's when there are two halogens in adjacent positions. But in this case, we have only one Br and one D. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So positions 1 and 2 are Br and D. So they're adjacent. So during the reaction, perhaps the Br and D could be involved in some kind of elimination.

Wait, but D is a deuterium, which is a hydrogen isotope. So, in a substitution reaction, would D be replaced? Or perhaps in an elimination reaction, could the D be abstracted as a leaving group?

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation. So, bromide leaves, and a proton (deuterium) is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, in aromatic compounds, elimination usually requires a good base and adjacent leaving groups. So perhaps the D and Br are in positions that allow for elimination.

Wait, but another thought: in such a reaction, perhaps the base (NH2-) abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzyl carbanion, which then eliminates Br-.

Wait, but this is similar to the formation of benzynes. Oh right! The benzynes mechanism. So in the case of dihalobenzenes, when treated with a strong base, they can lose two leaving groups and form a triple bond, becoming a diradical or a triple bond (like o-benzyne). But in this case, we have only one Br and a D adjacent to it. So maybe the D is not a leaving group, but perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to Br.

Wait, but wait, deuterium is a heavier isotope and less reactive than hydrogen, but in this case, it's attached to the same carbon as Br? Or is it on the adjacent carbon?

Wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the bromine is on position 1, and deuterium on position 2. So in the ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 2, but wait, position 2 already has a deuterium. Hmm, so if the base abstracts the deuterium, then that would leave a negative charge on the ring, which could lead to elimination of Br-.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Because D is a good leaving group only in certain conditions. Wait, no—if the base abstracts the D (deuterium), then the adjacent carbon would have a negative charge. But wait, in aromatic rings, it's hard to get a negative charge because of resonance. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is in the ortho position relative to Br. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br, then that's not adjacent. Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 has D. So positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3 is next, and 4 is opposite to Br.

Wait, maybe another approach. What happens when a substituted benzene undergoes treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia? I recall that for benzene rings with substituents, elimination can occur, especially when there's a possibility to form a conjugated diene in the ring.

Wait, but let me think about the benzene ring. If the Br leaves, but the ring can't just open up because that would disrupt aromaticity. So perhaps elimination isn't straightforward.

Wait, another angle: the reaction is an elimination reaction leading to the formation of a ring with a triple bond, similar to benzynes. But benzynes require two leaving groups. So with only one Br and a D, perhaps the D is a leaving group as well?

Wait, but deuterium is H's isotope. In acidic conditions, H or D can leave as H+ or D+, but under basic conditions, more likely to abstract as H-? Hmm, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to formation of an aromatic ring with a double bond—wait, but that would require two adjacent leaving groups. Or maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen (deuterium) from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then eliminates Br- as a leaving group, forming a triple bond. But wait, in benzynes, you lose two leaving groups, but here we have only one. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the rest positions are H. So perhaps the D is on carbon 2, adjacent to Br on carbon 1. So, when the base (NH2-) abstracts a proton (deuterium) from carbon 2, the Br on carbon 1 leaves as Br-, and a double bond is formed between carbon 1 and 2? That would create a cyclohexadienyl anion, but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the loss of Br and D would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require both Br and D to leave. But D is a deuterium; would it act as a leaving group? Or perhaps the D is abstracted as H- (which would be deuterium, so D-), and Br leaves as Br-, leading to the formation of a triple bond. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a triple bond between C1 and C2, resulting in benzene with a triple bond (like o-benzyne). But wait, o-benzyne is formed from 1,2-dihaloarenes. Since we only have one Br and one D, perhaps this is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution. But on a benzene ring, substitution would require some activating group. But Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so substitution would be difficult without a good leaving group and activating conditions.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is replaced by another group. But under basic conditions, would that happen? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But I think that requires a strong activating group, such as a strong electron-donating group, which Br isn't. So perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is abstracted by the base, leading to a carbanion, and the Br leaves as Br-.

Wait, but forming a carbanion on a benzene ring adjacent to Br would lead to what? Maybe the ring becomes antiaromatic if a double bond forms. That can't be stable, so perhaps it would rearrange.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products.

If elimination occurs, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2 (if both Br and D are eliminated), forming o-benzyne. But wait, in that case, the starting material would need two leaving groups. Here, we have Br and D. Wait, but D is a single atom. So if the base abstracts D (as H-?), then Br could leave, leading to a triple bond.

Wait, but I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a vinyl benzene, but that would require a double bond.

Wait, but another possibility: the reaction might not proceed as an elimination but instead as a substitution. But in that case, the substituent (like deuterium) would have to be replaced. But I don't see a good reason for that substitution here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a diene. But on a benzene ring, it's difficult to form a diene as the ring remains aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe the D is a deuterium on a benzylic position. Wait, no, the substituents are on the ring itself. So benzylic deuterium would be on a side chain, but in this case, the D is on the ring.

Wait, let me consider the possible products differently. If the Br and D are eliminated, perhaps the ring loses two substituents and forms a triple bond. But that's only possible if both are leaving groups. But D is not a good leaving group unless it's in a very acidic environment. But in a basic solution, perhaps it's more likely that H is abstracted as H-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the mechanism again.

In a benzene ring with Br and D in adjacent positions, NaNH2 (a strong base) in ammonia. Perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion and elimination of Br- as the leaving group. But wait, if D is on position 2 and the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, then we would have a negative charge on position 2, but wait, position 2 has D, which is a heavier isotope. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts the D, which is on position 2, leading to a negative charge on position 2. Then the Br on position 1 leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, making it o-benzyne. But wait, that requires both substituents to leave, but we started with only Br and D. So, the D would have to be a leaving group, which is unlikely because D is not a good leaving group under basic conditions. Or wait, in condensed ammonia, under strong basic conditions, maybe D can be abstracted as D-.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, not position 2. Then, adjacent to Br, elimination can occur. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but I don't see how that would happen without the base abstracting a hydrogen adjacent to Br.

Wait, maybe the product is 1-deutero benzene, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction is NaNH2, which is basic, so substitution would require a good leaving group. But Br is a good leaving group, but D is not.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2.

In the reaction with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. NaNH2 is often used for eliminations, especially in aliphatic compounds where adjacent leaving groups are present.

Wait, but here, in aromatic compounds, perhaps the reaction could form a benzyn intermediate. For benzynes, you need two halogens on adjacent positions, like 1,2-dibromo benzene. Then, elimination of two X groups forms the triple bond. But in our case, we have only one Br and one D. So, maybe the D isn't a suitable leaving group. Thus, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as an elimination, and instead, there's no product, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3. So there must be some products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But what? The base is NH2-. So perhaps the Br could undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but only if the ring is activated towards that. But Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring. So substitution might not be feasible unless the ring has strong activating groups elsewhere, which it doesn't here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is substituted. But why would that happen? The deuterium is on the ring, and under basic conditions, substitution would require a good leaving group. D is not a good leaving group in basic conditions, I think.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium is involved in a hydrogen shift. But I'm not sure how that would help in elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about ring expansion or contraction, but I don't recall such reactions with NaNH2.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the reaction is a coupling. But I'm not sure if NaNH2 in ammonia would cause a coupling reaction here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but NaNH2 is often used in Birch reductions, but that's with metals like Na or Li. Wait, Birch reduction is usually with Li or Na and NH3. In Birch conditions, the ring is hydrogenated, but that would produce cyclohexane derivatives. But in this case, the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative.

Wait, but if it's treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Let's say that the Br leaves, and a hydrogen (from position 2, which is D) is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but D is on C2, so if the H (deuterium) is abstracted, then the C2 would have a negative charge, which could pair with the adjacent C1's Br leaving as Br-.

Wait, but then that would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But benzene is an aromatic ring, so losing two substituents would disrupt that. So perhaps the ring would form a cyclohexadienyl anion, but I'm not sure if that's stable.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a vinyl benzene, with a double bond between C1 and C2. But I'm not sure if that's possible under these conditions.

Wait, but another thought: in the case where a benzene ring has two substituents (like Br and D) in adjacent positions, treatment with NaNH2 might lead to the formation of a diradical or a triple bond. So, if both substituents are eliminated, a triple bond would form, making o-benzyne. But wait, o-benzyne is a very reactive species, and perhaps it would dimerize or undergo other reactions quickly. So the product might be a diradical intermediate, but in terms of products, perhaps it's not isolated.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form o-benzyne because we don't have two leaving groups. So maybe another pathway is followed.

Wait, perhaps elimination of Br- and H- (from D) leads to a benzene ring with a triple bond. So, the product would be o-benzyne, but again, that requires two leaving groups. So maybe the starting material only has Br and D, so that's two substituents. So perhaps elimination of Br and D would form o-benzyne.

But wait, D is a deuterium. For elimination, perhaps the base abstracts the D as a leaving group, but deuterium is not a good leaving group. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't have zero as an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by a hydrogen (or deuterium). But under what conditions does that happen? SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) typically requires a good leaving group and a strongly activating group. But Br is a reasonable leaving group, but the ring is deactivated because of Br, making substitution difficult.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2. But that's a nucleophilic substitution. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But is that feasible?

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base and a good source of NH2- ions. So perhaps the Br undergoes substitution with NH2- as the nucleophile. But the ring is deactivated by Br, so SNAr would require a strongly activating group, which we don't have here. So perhaps substitution doesn't occur.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the problem is about the number of possible products, so maybe the reaction leads to multiple products based on the regiochemistry or stereochemistry.

Wait, but if elimination is the pathway, and the product is a triple bond (o-benzyne), then that's a single product. Alternatively, if substitution occurs, perhaps there's only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product. But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, leading to a different elimination pathway. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ring can lose Br and a hydrogen from either position 2 or position 4, leading to different products. But wait, position 4 is para to Br, so if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, then elimination would form a bond between position 1 and position 4? That would give a different structure, perhaps a meta arrangement.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 (which has D), but D is a deuterium, maybe that's not feasible. Alternatively, abstracting a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D), but that's not adjacent to Br.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: when you have a benzene ring with a substituent, and you treat it with a strong base, the possible reactions are either elimination (if adjacent H's are present) or substitution.

In this case, the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, elimination would require the base to abstract a H adjacent to Br. So, the possible positions for H abstraction would be position 2 (which has D, so maybe not) or position 6 (assuming the numbering is such that position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, position 3 is next, and position 6 is adjacent to Br on the other side).

Wait, perhaps the base can abstract a H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. That would set up an elimination where Br- leaves, and a double bond forms between positions 1 and 6.

But wait, in that case, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6, which would be a 1,6-diene. But benzene is a six-membered ring; the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, if a double bond forms between 1 and 6, that would create a ring with a single double bond, which would disrupt the aromaticity. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes antiaromatic if a triple bond forms, but that's not possible here.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but I'm not sure how that would happen without the base abstracting a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as expected, and the only possible product is the starting material, but that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the reaction leads to a single product, such as o-benzyne. But let's think: o-benzyne is formed when you have two halogens on adjacent carbons, which then lose both to form the triple bond. In this case, we have only one Br and one D. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't include zero.

Wait, maybe the D is a deuterium in a position that allows for elimination, leading to two possible products based on where the elimination occurs. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in the reaction of 1-bromo-2-d benzene with a strong base, perhaps the Br leaves, and a deuterium is abstracted, leading to the formation of a ring with a triple bond. That would give o-benzyne, which is a single product. So the number of possible products is 1.

But wait, the options have B as 1. So could the answer be B?

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple sites where elimination can occur, leading to more than one product. For example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from either position 2 (but it's D) or position 6, leading to different sites for elimination.

Wait, but position 2 has D, which might not be abstracted as easily. So maybe the base abstracts from position 6, leading to elimination of Br from position 1, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6, which would be para to each other, but that's not possible because triple bonds require adjacent positions.

Wait, no, triple bonds can't form between positions that are not adjacent. So if the base abstracts from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br), then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that would require the positions to be adjacent, which they are not. So that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products again. If elimination leads to o-benzyne (triple bond between 1 and 2), then that's one product. But wait, if the base could abstract a H from either position 2 (D) or position 6, leading to different products, but that's not possible because D is a deuterium and not a H.

Alternatively, perhaps there's only one possible site for elimination, leading to one product. So the number of possible organic products is 1, which would make option B the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a substitution product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. But that would require the base to abstract a H from C2 (which is D) or from C3 (not adjacent to Br). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a vinyl group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm going around in circles here. Maybe the correct answer is 1 product, so option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The starting material is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for elimination reactions, particularly in aromatic systems where adjacent substituents facilitate dehydrohalogenation.

In this case, the bromine and deuterium are on adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 2). The reaction likely proceeds via an elimination mechanism, where the strong base abstracts the deuterium (D) from position 2, and the bromine (Br) at position 1 leaves as Br⁻. This results in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, yielding o-benzyne (a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2).

The structure of the starting material and the reaction conditions suggest that elimination is the dominant pathway. Since there is only one Br and one D in the molecule, and they are adjacent, the reaction leads to a single product: o-benzyne. There are no other plausible pathways for substitution or rearrangement under these conditions, as the ring remains aromatic, and no additional reactive sites are present.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B
