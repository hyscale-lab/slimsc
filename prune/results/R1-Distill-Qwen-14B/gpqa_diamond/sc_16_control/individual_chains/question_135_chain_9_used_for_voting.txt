Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about this term. Oh right, I think this is like a Yukawa coupling term. The boson X is interacting with fermions, and maybe it's giving them mass when υ is non-zero. Because if υ is the vacuum expectation value (VEV), then the term υ X would contribute to the mass of the fermions. But wait, in this case, the mass term is more like coming from the υ, and X is a field. So the interaction here is between X and the fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means the energy has to be enough to produce the particles. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion in the pair has mass m, so 2m ≤ m_X.

What fermions are we talking about here? Let me think about the fermion masses. The known fermion masses are:

Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.004 GeV (so about 0.004 *2 = 0.008 is needed)
Down quark (d): ~0.008 GeV (so 0.016 needed)
Strange (s): ~0.1 GeV (so 0.2 GeV needed)
Charm (c): ~1.25 GeV (so 2.5 GeV needed)
Bottom (b): ~4.1 GeV (so 8.2 GeV needed)
Top (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV (so X can't decay into t tbar since 6 GeV < 8.2 GeV for b's)

Wait, but let me get exact figures. So, the X has a mass of 6 GeV. So for decay products, the sum of the masses of the two fermions must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So for each fermion pair, let's check:

Electron pair: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV. That's way below 6 GeV. So allowed.

Same for muon: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 GeV. Also allowed.

Tau: 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV.

Quarks:

u quark: 0.004 GeV each. So 0.008 GeV total. Allowed.

d quark: 0.008 GeV each. 0.016 GeV. Also allowed.

s quark: 0.1 GeV each. 0.2 GeV. Allowed.

c quark: 1.25 GeV each. 2.5 GeV. Also allowed. Because 2.5 <6.

b quark: 4.1 GeV each. So 8.2 GeV. But wait, X is 6 GeV, which is less than 8.2. So you can't have two b quarks. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, but wait. The X is a boson, so the decay products have to be a fermion and antifermion. So, for each possible fermion, check if the mass is less than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be ≤3 GeV).

Wait, no. Because the sum of the two fermion masses must be ≤6 GeV. So for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So let's list all possible fermions:

Leptons:
e: 0.0005 GeV. 2m_e = 0.001 ≤6 → allowed.
μ: 0.1 GeV. 2m_mu =0.2 ≤6 → allowed.
τ: 1.777 GeV. 2m_tau ≈3.554 ≤6 → allowed.

Quarks:
u: 0.004 → 0.008 ≤6 → allowed.
d: 0.008 → 0.016 ≤6 → allowed.
s: 0.1 → 0.2 ≤6 → allowed.
c: 1.25 → 2.5 ≤6 → allowed.
b:4.1 → 8.2 >6 → not allowed.
t: way too heavy, 173 → 346>6 → not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are into e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and all the quark pairs: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but what about the top quark? Because even if m_t is 173 GeV, which is way beyond 6 GeV, so X can’t decay into t tbar.

So the possible decay products for X should include all these fermion pairs except for b and t.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau, e+ e-.
But wait, if X can't decay into b bbar because 2m_b=8.2 GeV>6, then option A is wrong.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e+ e-.
That seems to include all the allowed fermions except b and t. So B includes c, which is allowed because 2m_c=2.5 <6. So B is a possibility.

Option C: c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is not allowed, so C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. Again, includes b which is not allowed, so D is wrong.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me double-check the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option A includes b and s, u, d, tau, e. But b is excluded.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is excluded, so C is wrong.

Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So also wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the decay products based on the condition that the total mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). Specifically, for \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)), the mass of the fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u = 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d = 0.016 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 2.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed**.
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), corresponding to **Option B**.
