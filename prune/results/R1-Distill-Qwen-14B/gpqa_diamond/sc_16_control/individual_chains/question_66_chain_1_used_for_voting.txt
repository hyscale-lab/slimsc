Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. Oh right, the Standard Model has certain gauge symmetries, like SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), and I think the SMEFT operators are constructed to respect these. But what about other symmetries like Lorentz and Poincare?

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations. Since the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, I guess SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT has to be a Lorentz scalar, right? That makes sense because the operators are built from fields transforming in certain ways, and the product must form a scalar.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare symmetry is the broader symmetry. But wait, when building effective field theories, sometimes you break some of these symmetries? Or do you have to respect all of them? Wait, the SMEFT is a theory that's supposed to describe physics up to some high scale, so I think it should respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, including Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, maybe Poincare symmetry isn't necessarily required because effective theories can often break some of the higher symmetries? Or wait, Poincare is about the isometries of Minkowski space. So the Standard Model respects Poincare, so SMEFT should too. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. Wait, but the question is about which of these must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

What about CP symmetry and CPT symmetry? CP is charge conjugation combined with parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT would include operators that can violate CP. But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. If the SM already has CP violation, then the SMEFT can have terms that break CP as well. So the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a required symmetry.

CPT symmetry, though, that's different. CPT is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is believed to respect CPT symmetry. So I think that SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. Because if you include terms that break CPT, you might run into issues with unitarity or causality. Oh right, because if CPT is violated, you might get acausal interactions or other problems. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So looking back, the options are 1,2,4 and 1,3,4. Let me think again.

So Lorentz Symmetry (1) must be respected because the operators are built as Lorentz scalars. Poincare symmetry (2) is also a symmetry that the operators must respect because it's part of the underlying structure of the theory—without it, the theory wouldn't make sense in a Minkowski space.

Wait, but wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Do the SMEFT operators have to respect translation symmetry? Because the SMEFT is an effective theory, it's built with local operators. Each operator is a local object, so the theory as a whole should respect translation symmetry. So yes, Poincare is also a symmetry that must be respected. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

But wait, the options have combinations. Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So if both 1 and 2 are correct, and 4 is correct, then the correct set would include 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: since the theory is in Minkowski space, the operators must be local and translation-invariant. So the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct.

As for CPT symmetry, the SMEFT must respect it because the underlying SM does, and adding higher-dimension operators shouldn't break that. So 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought about CPT. So the answer should include 1,2,4. So that's option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Lorentz symmetry requires that all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars, ensuring invariance under Lorentz transformations. Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations, is also fundamental to the structure of SMEFT, as the theory is formulated in Minkowski space. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already exhibits CP violation, and SMEFT can include operators that further violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

CPT symmetry, however, must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model is believed to respect CPT symmetry, and violating it could lead to issues with unitarity and causality. Therefore, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement for SMEFT operators.

In summary, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). This corresponds to option C.
