Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's energy states and the momentum of a photon required to move it to the next state. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question says it's using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. So, that model considers both the rotation and vibration of the molecule. But wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, which transition are we looking at? The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state and needs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, so the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the first excited state, I guess.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact selection rules here.

So, the molecule is in the fundamental state. When it absorbs a photon, it'll transition to the next energy level. But what is the next possible energy level? There are two possibilities: either it can increase its vibrational state (v goes to 1) or increase its rotational state (J increases). But which one requires the lower energy? Or wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I think it's the next higher energy state overall, regardless of which transition.

Wait, but the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different. Vibration is usually a much higher energy transition. For example, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + ½) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are something like (J(J+1)) ħc / 2I, where I is the moment of inertia.

So, the fundamental state would be v=0 and J=0, I believe. The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But wait, the rotational states might have a lower energy than the vibrational ones, so the next state could be a rotational transition. But wait, which one's energy is higher? Let me think about the energies.

The vibrational energy levels: the spacing between them is ħω. The rotational energy levels go up in steps of roughly ħc / (2I) per increment in J. So, which is bigger, ħω or ħc/(2I)?

Given the values provided: ω is 4e14 rad/s. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So, the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Calculating μ: The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So Mx=20, My=2. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. To convert to kg, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

I = μ R² = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.014e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg m².

Now the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1)) * ħ c / (2 I) * something? Wait, I think the formula is E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/(2π)).

Wait, let me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

So the rotational energy difference between J and J+1 is E_rot(J+1) - E_rot(J) = [ ( (J+1)(J+2) ) - (J(J+1)) ] * (ħ²)/(2 I) ) 

Simplify that: (J+2 - J) * (something) => 2*(something). So the energy step for rotation is 2 * (ħ²)/(2 I) ) * (2J + 2) ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the energy of the first rotational state (J=0 to J=1). The energy when J=0 is 0, and J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * ħ² / (2I) = 2 * (1.054e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2056e-46) ) Wait, that might be for E_rot(J=1). Let me compute that.

E_rot = (1*(1+1)) * (ħ²) / (2I) = 2 * (1.054e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2056e-46) )

Simplify denominator: 2 * 1.2056e-46 = 2.411e-46.

Numerator: 2 * (1.054e-34)^2 = 2 * (1.11e-68) ) = 2.22e-68.

So E_rot = 2.22e-68 / 2.411e-46 = approximately 9.2e-23 J? That seems low. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute.

E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ( (1.054e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2056e-46) )

The 2 in numerator and denominator cancel, so we have (1.054e-34)^2 / (1.2056e-46 )

Compute (1.054e-34)^2: (1.054)^2 = approx 1.11, so 1.11e-68.

Then divide by 1.2056e-46: 1.11e-68 / 1.2056e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J. So yes, about 9.2e-23 J.

Now, what about the vibrational energy change? The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + ½) ħω. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is (1 + ½ - (0 + ½)) ) * ħω = (1) * ħω.

So ħω is (1.054e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) ) = 4.216e-20 J.

So comparing the two: E_rot(J=1) is about 9.2e-23 J, and E_vib(v=1) is about 4.216e-20 J. So E_vib is much larger.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next energy states would be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which one requires less energy?

So E_rot for J=1 is ~9.2e-23 J, E_vib for v=1 is ~4.216e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would cause the molecule to jump to the next rotational state, J=1.

Wait, but I thought the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible. So to go to the next state, it would be the lowest energy state higher than the fundamental, which is the first excited state. So that would be either the first rotational state or the first vibrational state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would cause the molecule to go to J=1, v=0.

So the energy required is the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

Wait, but wait, does the selection rule allow for that? For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, and usually for diatomic molecules, J must change by ±1. So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference. So the energy (E_photon) is E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum of the photon. Because photons carry momentum p = E/c. So to find the momentum, I can compute E_photon / c.

So E_photon is 9.2e-23 J. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 1e-27 to 2e-27, which is three to four orders higher than this.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating E_rot.

Wait, wait, let me recheck E_rot calculation.

E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I )

Wait, for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, it's (ħ² * 2 )/(2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because J=1, so J(J+1)=2. So E_rot is (2 ħ^2) / (2 I) ) = ħ² / I.

So let me recalculate that.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s

ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

I is 1.2056e-46 kg m².

E_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2056e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / 1.2056e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, same as before. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the energy is 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options are close to that. The options are all around 1e-27.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the transition. Maybe the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0) and the next state is v=1, J=0, which requires the vibrational energy.

Wait, because if the rotational transition requires less energy, why would the options not match? Alternatively, perhaps I got the model wrong. Since the model is the non-rigid rotor model, but maybe it's a vibration-rotation coupling, so the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, maybe the question is about the Raman effect, where the rotational state changes without a change in vibrational state. But the photon's energy is purely rotational. Alternatively, perhaps the next state allowed is the first vibrational state, which is higher energy.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next possible state is the one with the smallest energy increase. So between the first rotational and first vibrational states, the rotational transition is lower energy, so the photon must have that energy.

But according to my calculation, that's 9.2e-23 J, which is 3.07e-31 kg m/s when calculating p=E/c. Yet the options are way larger.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia I.

I = μ R².

μ is the reduced mass, which is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY).

mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu. So (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R^2 = 3.014e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2056e-46 kg m².

That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered the bond length in another unit, but no, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

Hmm, so perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Maybe the energy difference for rotation is not E_rot = ħ²/(2 I), but something else.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational transition. Because the options' energies are much higher than what I calculated for rotation.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon_vib = ħω = (1.054e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) )= 4.216e-20 J.

p = E_photon_vib / c = 4.216e-20 / 3e8 = approx 1.405e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 1.4e-28 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s. So that would match option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But earlier, I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon have vibrational energy?

Ah, perhaps I confused the terms. Let me reevaluate: the question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest state. The next state with the lowest possible energy is the first vibrational state, because the energy required for rotation is much lower than that of vibration. Wait, no, if the rotational transition requires less energy, it's the next state.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the total energy levels. The energy for a state is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

In the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The energy of these states is E1 = (0 + ½)ħω + (0 + 0) = ½ ħω, and E2 = (0 + ½)ħω + (1*(1+1))ħ/(2I) * something.

Wait, no, the E_rot is (J(J+1) ħ² )/(2 I) for each J.

So, E_vib for v=0 is ½ ħω, but when v=0 and J=1, the energy is ½ ħω + (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ½ ħω + ( ħ² )/(I).

Wait, but the energy difference between the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the (v=0, J=1) state is E_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

The energy to go to (v=1, J=0) is E_vib = ħω ≈ 4.216e-20 J.

So between the two, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the (v=0, J=1) state.

So the photon must supply the energy difference for this transition.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum p is E/c, which is 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are this small. So I'm confused. The options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C) 1.1e-27, D) 1.4e-28.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is considering the molecule as a diatomic in the rotation-vibration model, meaning that the energy transitions involve both rotation and vibration. Or perhaps the selection rule allows for a simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational state.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized for rotation, and for vibration, the energy levels are quantized as (v + ½) ħω. So the total energy is the sum.

But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the bond length isn't fixed, so rotation and vibration are coupled. But for the purposes of this question, perhaps the main point is that the molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the next state, which could be either rotational or vibrational.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0). Because if the photon must cause a change in both v and J, perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, which would require the photon to supply the vibrational energy.

But why would that be the case? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so it's lower in energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the transition where both rotational and vibrational states change. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe I've mixed the energy scales. Let me compute the energies again more accurately.

E_rot(J=1) = (1 * 2) * ħ² / (2 I) ) = (2 ħ²) / (2 I) ) = ħ²/I.

Compute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.2056e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2056e-46 = approx 9.22e-23 J.

E_photon_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

p_rot = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but this is way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I've made a wrong approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the photon's energy is the difference between the first vibrational state and the fundamental state. So E_photon = ħω.

Then p = ħω / c = (1.054e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s) = (4.216e-20 J) / (3e8) = 1.405e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 1.4e-28 N·s. So that's option D.

But why would the next state be the vibrational state when the rotational transition is lower in energy?

Ah, perhaps because the rotational energy level is part of a series and the next state in energy is a combination of higher J but same v. No, because the rotational state with J=1 is lower than the vibrational v=1.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next state (in order of increasing energy) would be either J=1 or v=1, whichever is lower in energy. Since E_rot(J=1) is 9.2e-23 J and E_vib(v=1) is 4.216e-20 J, which is about 46 times higher. So the next state is J=1, v=0.

But none of the options match the momentum for that transition.

So perhaps the question is phrased differently. It says, when the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), what photon momentum would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the least energy increase.

But given that the options don't match the calculated rotational transition, perhaps the question is actually considering the energy required to go to the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So the momentum is E_photon_vib / c.

Which gives p = 1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

But why would the rotational transition require less energy yet the photon is for the vibrational one?

Ah, perhaps the question is mixing up the energy transitions. Maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule can have both rotational and vibrational transitions, and the question is seeking the energy for the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, but given the options, the correct choice would be D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about another angle.

The photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. The initial state is the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state is the first excited state, which is the one with the next higher energy. So which transition has a lower energy: J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0?

As calculated, J=1 requires 9.2e-23 J, v=1 requires 4.216e-20 J. So J=1 is lower. So the photon should have 9.2e-23 J, p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the molecule transitioning to the next state in a rotational-vibrational series, but the energy is a combination of both. But how?

Wait, another approach: The fundamental state is the lowest energy state (v=0, J=0). The next state in a rotational-vibrational spectrum is usually a combination of higher J and v=0, or higher v and J=0, depending on the transition. But in terms of energy, the first transition is the rotational one, followed by the vibrational.

But if I can't find a matching option, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy using the correct formula. Let me double-check the formula for rotational energy.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I).

Yes, that's correct. So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (2 * ħ²) / (2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me check again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = 40/22 = ~1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R^2 = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.014e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So E_rot = (1.054e-34)^2 / 1.2056e-46 = 1.112e-68 / 1.2056e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. Therefore, p = E/c = 9.2e-23/3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

So these are all about 1e-28 to 2e-27 kg m/s.

So why is there such a discrepancy?

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong unit for R. The bond length given is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the non-rigid rotor but the rigid rotor, but that shouldn't change much.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when transitioning from the ground state to the first vibrational state, which would give a larger momentum. Because 4.216e-20 J /3e8 m/s = 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

So perhaps the question expects us to assume that the molecule transitions to the first vibrational state, not considering the rotational transition's lower energy. So the answer is D.

But why would that be the case? Maybe the question is considering only vibrational transitions, or perhaps the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, but given the options, the correct option would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.014 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.014 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2056 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

4. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2I}
   \]
   For \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2056 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2056 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
   \]
   The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) and \( v = 1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)).
- However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition. Calculating the momentum for the rotational transition:
  \[
  p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
  \]
  This is far smaller than any of the given options.

- The vibrational transition momentum:
  \[
  p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.216 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
  \]
  This matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
Given the discrepancy between the calculated rotational momentum and the provided options, the question likely assumes the photon induces a vibrational transition rather than a rotational one. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
