Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and since it's inside, r must be less than R, right? Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, I imagine the conductor, the cavity inside, and the point P outside somewhere.

Wait, I remember that when you have a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was uncharged to start with. Oh right, because the conductor was uncharged, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, so for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. That happens because charges move freely. So any excess charge on a conductor resides on the surface. So in this case, the conductor is initially neutral. When we place a charge +q inside the cavity, it's like having a charge inside a cavity of a conductor. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. And since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, is that correct? So, the cavity has a charge +q, which induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. The conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must be +q.

So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, like at point P, the field should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's a spherical shell, so the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. That's the shell theorem, right?

But wait, point P is outside the spherical conductor, so the field there should depend only on the total charge outside the point. Wait, the conductor is neutral except for the outer charge. No, wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, no, the conductor was neutral, but when the +q is placed inside, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside the conductor is +q. So, any point outside the conductor (like P) would perceive the field as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait. The charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. Does that affect anything? Because the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge, but the outer surface would still be symmetric, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, and the outer surface is a shell. So the location of the inner charge (cavity) doesn't matter for the external field. Because the outer surface's charges will arrange themselves symmetrically to cancel any internal fields. So the external field is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

So, the answer would be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, let me think again. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, with an angle theta. So maybe the field isn't simply based on L. Or, is it?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, with charge +q. So when you’re outside, looking at the field, it doesn't matter where the charge is inside the conductor. The field outside a spherical shell of charge is the same as a point charge at the center. So for point P, the field depends only on the charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance L from the center.

So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. The other options involve l, s, or combinations with cos(theta), which might come into play if the field was calculated differently, perhaps if the conductor wasn't a sphere or something.

Wait, another point to consider. The conductor's inner cavity has an induced charge, but that's on the inner surface. The conductor's outer surface has +q, as the conductor was initially neutral.

So when you're outside the conductor, the induced charges (which are on the inner and outer surfaces) don't affect the external field. Only the outer charges matter. So the field outside is as if the charge +q is at the center.

So yeah, the correct answer must be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To solve this, we use the principles of electrostatics. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to maintain electrostatic equilibrium). Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system. 

For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and not on the distribution of charges inside. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. By the shell theorem, the field outside a spherical shell of charge is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they involve terms like $l$, $s$, or $\cos\theta$, which are irrelevant for the external electric field. The external field depends only on the total charge of the conductor and the distance $L$ from its center.

Answer: B
