Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So, this looks like a 2-dimensional metric in terms of x and y. Wait, but pseudospheres are usually surfaces in 3D, right? Or maybe this is a metric on a 2D surface that's being considered as a pseudosphere. I'm a bit confused there. Oh, wait, no, a pseudosphere in 2D is a model of hyperbolic geometry, like the Poincaré disk model. So perhaps this metric represents such a model.

The question is about finding the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, but the metric given doesn't explicitly have an r in it. So maybe the radius is implicit in the form of the metric. Let's see, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 is 2 squared. Oh, that makes sense because the radius r is 2, so 4 - x² - y² would represent the boundary of the disk, which is the edge of the pseudosphere model.

Now, I remember that the area of a pseudosphere (which is a hyperbolic surface) in the Poincaré disk model is finite. Wait, no, wait. Or is it? Because the Poincaré disk is an infinite hyperbolic plane, but when you consider the pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, it's a finite area. But wait, no, the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent but finite area. Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the standard pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature that has finite area. So it's a finite area. But when you model it in the Poincaré disk, the disk itself is finite radius (like r=2 here), but the metric within the disk covers the entire hyperbolic plane, which is infinite in extent. So that's a bit conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the hyperbolic plane's area. But no, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". So I think the pseudosphere here is a finite surface. So how to compute its area using the given metric.

Wait, but the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). That looks similar to the Poincaré disk metric, which is usually written as ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²), but scaled. Wait, in the Poincaré disk model with radius a, the metric is (a²)/(1 - (x² + y²)) times the Euclidean metric. So comparing, our given metric has 32/(4 - (x² + y²)) which is 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) = 8/(1 - (x^2 + y^2)/4 ). Wait, that's 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/(2²)). So seems like a is 2. So the metric is the Poincaré disk with radius a=2.

Now, the area of the hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk is infinite, but that's the whole plane. However, I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere. Oh, wait, maybe the question is about the surface area of the pseudosphere (tractricoid) itself, which is a finite area. So what's the area of a pseudosphere of radius r?

I think the formula for the area of a pseudosphere is 4πr². Because for a sphere, the area is 4πr², and the pseudosphere, being a surface of revolution, might have the same formula. Wait, but a pseudosphere has negative curvature, but area-wise, maybe it's similar. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the area using the given metric. The given metric is in 2D, so maybe it's representing some part of the hyperbolic plane, and the area can be computed by integrating the determinant of the metric over the region where the metric is defined.

The metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². In this case, the cross term is zero because it's diagonal. So the determinant of the metric tensor g is g_xx * g_yy, since g_xy is zero. So determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] * [32/(4 - x² - y²)]? Wait, no, wait: the metric is (32/(4-x²-y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, g_xy = 0.

So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))² * | determinant of the identity matrix |, but since it's diagonal, determinant is product of diagonal terms. So det(g) = [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y². Wait, but for area in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So area is the integral over all x and y where the denominator is positive, i.e., 4 - x² - y² >0 → x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2.

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt(det(g)) is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy, with r² <4.

But since this is in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So factor out the constants: 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the r integral: ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ (-1/2) du/u → (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

Evaluated from r=0 to 2: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So limits become from u=4 to u=0.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 = (-1/2) [ln(0) - ln(4)].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, but wait, at r=2, u=0, so the integral approaches negative infinity. Hmm, that would make the area integral diverge, but that can't be right because the pseudosphere's area should be finite.

Wait, but wait, the Poincaré disk model covers the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So integrating the determinant over the disk would give an infinite area. But the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2, which is a finite area surface. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the question is using this metric to model the pseudosphere, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for the hyperbolic plane, and the pseudosphere is a different concept. Let me think again.

The pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface in 3D, and its area can be computed using its own metric. But the metric given here is a 2D metric, which could be the induced metric on the pseudosphere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the area of the Poincaré disk itself, which is the region x² + y² <4, but that's just a regular Euclidean disk, but with a hyperbolic metric. Wait, no, the area in the hyperbolic metric would be different.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to compute the integral, I found that the area is infinite. But the options include A)0, B)4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is +infty. So maybe that's the answer. But wait, what's the area of the pseudosphere? Earlier I thought it's 4π r², but with r=2, that would be 16π. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. The pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, like a horn torus but with negative curvature. Its area is finite. The formula is similar to a sphere's area. So 4π r². With r=2, that's 16π.

But none of the options match that. The options don't have 16π. So perhaps the question is using the given metric to compute the area in this model, which would be infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of the Poincaré disk model, which is the region x² + y² <4, but under the hyperbolic metric. As I computed earlier, the area integral diverges, giving infinity. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface, while the hyperbolic plane is infinite. So perhaps the question is confusing the two.

Alternatively, maybe the metric provided is not for the entire pseudosphere but for a part of it, but then the area would still depend on the region.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the metric and what it represents. The metric given is conformally flat, with the conformal factor being 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)]² * dx dy, but wait, no. Wait, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. Since g is diagonal, sqrt(g) is the product of the square roots of the diagonal terms. So sqrt(g) = 32/(4 - x² - y²), because each diagonal term is 32/(4 - r²), so sqrt(g) is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²)]^0.5? Wait no, wait—no, wait, no. Wait, the metric is g = diag( a, a ), where a = 32/(4 - r²). So the determinant is a^2. The square root of the determinant is a, because sqrt(a^2) is |a|. Since a is positive in the domain x² + y² <4, sqrt(det(g)) is a. So the area element is a dx dy = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So integrating this over the disk of radius 2 would give us the area in hyperbolic space, which is infinite. So the area would be +infty. But the pseudosphere's area is finite. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but the question says, "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". So perhaps the given metric represents the pseudosphere embedded in 3D space, but I don't think it is. The metric seems to be a 2D metric, so probably represents the induced metric on the pseudosphere. But then the area would be finite.

Wait, another approach: the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. The Gaussian curvature K is related to the metric. For a surface with metric ds² = E dx² + G dy², the Gaussian curvature is given by a formula involving the derivatives of E and G. But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the pseudosphere can be found using the formula for a surface of revolution. The pseudosphere is generated by rotating a tractrix around its asymptote. The area can be computed by integrating the surface area of the revolution.

The formula for the surface area of a surface of revolution is 2π ∫ y ds, where y is the function being rotated, and ds is the arc length element along the curve.

The tractrix has the property that the distance from any point on the curve to the asymptote is constant, equal to the radius r. The tractrix can be parametrized as x = r cosh(u), y = r (u - sinh(u)), where u is a parameter. Wait, I'm not sure about that parametrization; maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps a parametrization is x = r cosh t, y = r (t - sinh t), where t is a parameter.

The surface area would then be 2π ∫ y √( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 ) dt, integrated from t = -infty to t = +infty. But integrating this might be tricky, and I'm not sure I can compute it on the spot.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 4π r², but I'm not certain. If r=2, that would be 16 π, but that's not an option here.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So perhaps the given metric represents a model with infinite area, like the hyperbolic plane, and the pseudosphere's area is finite, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is the metric of the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area, so the area is +infty, which would be option D.

So, considering all this, the area under the given metric is infinite, so the answer is D.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) indicates a disk of radius \( r = 2 \), as \( 4 = 2^2 \). This metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor scaling the Euclidean metric.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we analyze the metric. The area element in this metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), and \( g_{xy} = 0 \). Thus, the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
\]

The area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), so we switch to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos \theta \), \( y = r \sin \theta \), with \( r \in [0, 2] \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi] \). The area integral is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) diverges because the denominator approaches zero as \( r \to 2 \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere, as represented by this metric, is infinite.

The pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite-area surface in 3D space, but the metric provided here appears to model the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere under this metric is infinite.

**Options Analysis:**
