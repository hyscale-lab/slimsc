Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, but I'm not too sure about the specifics here. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because dx and dy are involved, so we're looking at a 2D manifold. But what kind of geometry is this?

I think this might be a hyperbolic metric. Hyperbolic space has a negative curvature, and the metric usually has a term in the denominator that's linear in the coordinates. Oh, right, the standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(z²), but here it's a bit different. Let me see: the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²), so perhaps this is a conformally flat metric, where the spatial part is scaled by a function of x and y.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere... Oh, wait, pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for surfaces with constant negative curvature. But in this question, are we talking about a pseudosphere in 2D? Or is this part of a higher-dimensional spacetime?

Wait, the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. Pseudosphere is a term from hyperbolic geometry. The area of a sphere in hyperbolic space would be different from the usual spherical area. But wait, in Euclidean space, the sphere area is 4πr², but hyperbolic is different.

Wait, no, hyperbolic space is non-compact, so areas can be infinite. But pseudosphere, perhaps referring to something else? Or maybe in this metric, the spatial part is such that the area is finite.

Wait, the metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space, but scaled somehow.

Wait, the denominator 4 - x² - y² implies that x² + y² <4, so the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area element would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. To find the total area, integrate this over all x and y where x² + y² <4.

Wait, so the area A is the integral over x and y of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy. Let me switch to polar coordinates because of the x² + y² term. So x= r cosθ, y= r sinθ, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. Then the integral becomes:

A = 32 ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [1/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Hmm, let's compute that. First, take the angular integral. Since it's independent of r, the integral over θ is just 2π. So A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

So that's 64π times the integral from 0 to 2 of r/(4 - r²) dr. Let me compute that integral.

Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du / u from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln |u| ] from 4 to 0. But wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches -infty. So the integral would be (-1/2) (ln 0 - ln4) → (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ). Wait, that's a problem. Because as r approaches 2, u approaches zero, so the integrand goes to infinity. So the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2 is divergent. It's infinite.

Wait, but that would make the area infinite. So the area A is 64π * (infinite), which is infinite.

But wait, the options include option D) +infty. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but what's the pseudosphere's area in this context? The metric given is perhaps for a 2D hyperbolic space. But wait, in two dimensions, hyperbolic space is infinite in extent, so its area is infinite. So if this is a model of H^2, then the total area would be infinite.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, maybe that's a sphere embedded in hyperbolic space. Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, a sphere (or a circle) has an area, but the space itself is unbounded.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing terms. The metric given is for a 2D space, and it's being referred to as a pseudosphere. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a 2-dimensional sphere in some space? Or maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional spacetime, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, the metric is 2-dimensional, so it's describing a 2D surface. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Perhaps in this metric, the pseudosphere has an infinite area, so the answer is D) +infty.

But wait, let me think again. The metric given is in 2D, but the area computed is infinite because the integral diverges. So the area is infinite, which would make option D correct.

Looking at the options:

A) 0 – that doesn't make sense.

B and C are expressions involving x and y, but area should be a number, not a function of x and y.

So only option D, which is +infty, makes sense.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D spacetime. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we interpret the metric as defining a 2D surface. The pseudosphere refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, and the metric suggests a hyperbolic geometry. The total area is computed by integrating the area element over the domain where \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

The area element is given by:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges as \( u \to 0 \), since \( \ln u \to -\infty \). Therefore, the total area \( A \) is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that hyperbolic space is non-compact and has infinite extent, leading to an infinite area.

Examining the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly infinite, not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)** and **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as these are functions of \( x \) and \( y \), not numerical values.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area is infinite due to the divergence of the integral.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
