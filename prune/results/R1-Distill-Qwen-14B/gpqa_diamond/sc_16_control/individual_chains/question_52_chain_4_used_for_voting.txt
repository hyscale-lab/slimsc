Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a star with some specific parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They've observed that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

Hmm, right. So I remember something about the Boltzmann equation in the context of stellar atmospheres and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in different energy levels to the temperature. The equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy of the level.

Wait, but wait—does the presence of spots affect the temperature of the photosphere? The question says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the effective temperature is lower when spots are covering part of the surface. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, right? So when 40% of the surface is covered by darker, cooler spots, the overall effective temperature of the star goes down. But how does that affect the photosphere's temperature?

Wait, the question says that the photosphere's effective temperature decreases. So the entire photosphere's average temperature is lower when spots are present. When the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K; with spots, it's 5500 K. But wait, does that mean the entire photosphere is uniformly at 5500 K when spots are present, or are parts of the photosphere cooler (the spots) and others at a higher temperature? The problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps we can treat the entire photosphere as at 5500 K in that case, or maybe it's a bit more nuanced. But the question says to assume LTE, so each region is in LTE.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So we're looking at the population of these levels. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the UV or near UV range. So that tells us something about the energy difference between the two levels.

Given that, when the temperature changes, the ratio of the populations of the two levels will change. So without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and with spots, it's lower (5500 K). 

The ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1, depending on how it's defined) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ). Wait, actually, it's n1 / n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The higher energy level (if E2 > E1) would have fewer atoms because they're less populated. So the ratio n2/n1 would be (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Alternatively, if we have E2 = E1 + delta E, then the ratio n_upper / n_lower is proportional to exp( -delta E/(k T) ). So in that case, when T is higher, the exponent is a smaller negative number, so the ratio increases.

Wait, let me clarify: The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ). So if E_upper is higher than E_lower, then (E_upper - E_lower) is positive, so exp(-x) decreases as x increases. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower would decrease as T decreases, because for lower T, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, making the ratio smaller.

In the problem, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the Teff is lower. Let me think: without spots, Teff is 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K. So when T decreases, if the ratio n1/n2 decreases, that suggests that n1 is the lower level and n2 is the upper level.

Wait, because if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative. Let's say E2 > E1. Then delta E = E2 - E1. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -delta E/(k T) ). So if delta E is positive, then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, which makes the entire term smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases. So if the ratio of n2/n1 decreases when T decreases, then the ratio of n1/n2 (which is 1/(n2/n1)) would increase.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.

Suppose we have two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, with E2 > E1. So level 2 is higher energy. The ratio of n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because E is higher for level 2, E2 - E1 is positive. So as T increases, the exponent increases (since denominator is larger), so the ratio n1/n2 increases. Because with higher T, more atoms are in higher energy levels, so n2 increases relative to n1. Wait, no. Wait, n_upper is n2, so if T increases, more population in upper level, so n2 increases, making n1/n2 decrease. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's restate:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -x ), where x is positive.

When T increases, x decreases because x is (E2-E1)/(k T). So exp(-x) increases. So n2/n1 increases with T. So when T is higher, the ratio n2/n1 is larger. So if T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.

So the ratio n1/n2 is (n2/n1)^(-1) = [ (g2/g1) exp( -x ) ]^(-1) = (g1/g2) exp(x). So as T decreases, x increases (since T is in denominator), exp(x) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(x) increases when T decreases.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me take an example. Suppose T is 6000 K, then it goes down to 5500 K. For the same two levels:

At higher T (6000), (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp[-(E2-E1)/(k T)] is larger. So n2/n1 is larger when T is higher. So when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So the reciprocal, n1/n2, would increase.

But the problem states that when the star has spots (Teff=5500), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Wait, that's the opposite of what I just found. Did I get the ratio backwards?

Ah, perhaps I have the ratio reversed in my mind. Maybe the question is about n_level1 / n_level2. Let me re-express the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if level 1 is lower in energy than level 2, then E_i is E1, E_j is E2, so (E_i - E_j) is negative. So the exponential becomes exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), which is same as exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, that's different. Because if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is positive. So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but that can't be right because when T is higher, the exponential term gets smaller, not larger. Because (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller when T is larger. So exp( a smaller positive number ) is smaller than exp( a larger positive number). Wait, no. If T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, so exp of a smaller number is smaller. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) multiplied by a smaller number when T increases.

Wait, but that can't be right because higher T would make more atoms in higher energy levels. So n2 would be higher when T is higher, making n1/n2 lower.

Yes, that makes sense. So when T increases, n2 increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So if the star without spots is hotter (6000 K), then n1/n2 is lower than when it's 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Wait, that's not matching. Because according to this, when T is higher, n1/n2 is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots, Teff=6000, so n1/n2 is lower. When the star has spots, Teff=5500, so n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio the other way. Maybe they're talking about n2/n1. Let me re-examine the question. The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)"—so it's n1/n2. But the observed change is that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, this ratio increases, unless (g1/g2) is small.

Hmm, but the problem says that when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So something is conflicting here. Perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual energy levels. Let me think about what the transition wavelength corresponds to. The transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps extreme UV. Let's compute the energy difference using the wavelength.

The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc / λ. The constant h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is wavelength in meters. So λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

Calculating E: E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But since we're dealing with thermal energy at the temperatures given, perhaps it's better to express this energy in terms of kT. The Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9950 K.

So delta E is about 9950 K in terms of thermal energy. So (delta E)/(k T) is roughly 9950 / T.

Wait, so for T = 6000 K, delta E/(k T) ≈ 9950 / 6000 ≈ 1.658. Similarly, for T=5500 K, it's 9950/5500 ≈ 1.809.

So the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(k T) ≈ 1.658 at 6000 K, and 1.809 at 5500 K.

So for the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which is (g1/g2) multiplied by exp(1.658) ≈ 5.24 at 6000 K, and exp(1.809) ≈ 6.08 at 5500 K.

Wait, so if g1/g2 is the same in both cases, then n1/n2 would increase from 5.24 to 6.08 when T decreases from 6000 to 5500 K. But the problem states that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when T is lower). That's a contradiction because according to this calculation, the ratio would increase.

Hmm, perhaps I have the levels reversed. Maybe level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. Wait, that would make sense if the ratio decreases when T decreases. Let me reevaluate.

Suppose level 1 is actually higher in energy than level 2. Then E2 < E1, so (E2 - E1) is negative, delta E = E1 - E2 = positive. Then the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) → (g1/g2) * exp( - (delta E)/(k T) )

Wait, that's a big difference. So in this case, the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So let's recalculate the exponents:

At T=6000 K, (E1-E2)/(k T) = 9950 / 6000 ≈1.658. So exp(-1.658) ≈ 0.19.

At T=5500 K, same delta E, (9950)/(5500) ≈1.809. exp(-1.809) ≈ 0.164.

So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * 0.19 at 6000 K, and (g1/g2) * 0.164 at 5500 K. So if g1/g2 is the same, then n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases, which matches the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Ah, so that makes sense. So in this case, level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of 1448 Å.

So the correct approach is to model the ratio n1/n2 as (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Given that, let's calculate the ratio when the star is without spots (T1=6000 K) and when it has spots (T2=5500 K).

Let me compute the ratio R1 = n1/n2 without spots, and R2 = n1/n2 with spots.

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T2) )

We can take the ratio R1/R2 to find the factor by which the ratio changes.

So R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) * exp( - x / T1 ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -x / T2 ) ] = exp( [ -x / T1 + x / T2 ] ) = exp( x (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because x is (E1-E2)/(k) = 9950 K.

So x = 9950 K.

Wait, actually, x is (E1-E2)/(k) = 9950 K, so in terms of (E1-E2)/(k T), it's 9950 / T.

So putting it all together:

R1/R2 = exp( (9950) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Compute the exponent part:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

So the difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply by 9950:

9950 * 0.000015151 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

9950 * 0.000015151 = 9950 * (1.5151e-5) = approximately 0.1504.

So the exponent is approximately 0.1504.

So R1/R2 = exp(0.1504) ≈ e^0.15 ≈ 1.162.

Wait, but wait, because I approximated 9950 as 10,000? Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 9950 is 9950, so:

Compute 9950 * 0.000015151.

0.000015151 = 1.5151e-5.

9950 * 1.5151e-5 = (9950 * 1.5151) *1e-5.

9950 *1.5151 ≈ let's compute 10,000 *1.5151 = 15,151. Then subtract 50 * 1.5151 = 75.755. So 15,151 - 75.755 = 15,075.245.

Multiply by 1e-5: 15,075.245e-5 = 0.15075245.

So exponent is approx 0.15075.

e^0.15075 is approximately e^0.15 is about 1.1618, and e^0.15075 is a bit higher. Let me compute more accurately.

e^0.15075 ≈ 1 + 0.15075 + (0.15075^2)/2 + (0.15075^3)/6.

0.15075^2 ≈ 0.022725, divided by 2 is 0.0113625.

0.15075^3 ≈ 0.00343, divided by 6 is ~0.0005717.

Sum: 1 + 0.15075=1.15075 + 0.0113625=1.1621125 + 0.0005717=1.162684. So approximately 1.1627.

So R1/R2 is about 1.1627, which is approximately 1.16. Looking at the options, the closest one is option A) ~1.1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me recap: R1 is the ratio without spots (6000 K), R2 is ratio with spots (5500 K). So R1/R2 is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So R2 is less than R1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

In our calculation, R1/R2 is about 1.16. So the factor is approximately 1.16, which is close to option A) ~1.1.

But wait, the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, 1.16 is closer to 1.1 than to 1.2, but the options don't have 1.16. But perhaps my calculation is wrong, perhaps I made an error in the exponent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is computed differently. Let me recalculate the energy from the wavelength.

Wait, the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 m.

E = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ (1.373e-18)/(1.602e-19) ≈ 8.57 eV.

But wait, each eV is about k*(11604 K), because k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So E ≈ 8.57 eV = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 99420 K. So delta E is about 99,420 K.

Wait, that's different from what I computed earlier. Oh wait, I think I messed up the unit conversion earlier.

Wait, E = hc/lambda. Let me compute E in terms of eV.

h = 6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s, lambda = 1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So delta E is 8.57 eV.

Now, using E = k * T * (some factor), but wait, the transition energy delta E is related to the thermal energy. So the ratio (delta E)/(k*T) is a dimensionless quantity.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So delta E/(k*T) = (8.57 eV) / ( (8.617e-5 eV/K) * T )

So for T1 = 6000 K,

delta E/(k*T1) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) = 8.57 / (0.51702) ≈ 16.58.

Similarly, for T2=5500 K,

delta E/(k*T2) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) = 8.57 / (0.473935) ≈ 18.09.

Wait, that's a big difference. So earlier I was using delta E in K, but I forgot that E is in eV. So the actual exponent is much larger.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because 8.57 eV is way higher than the typical thermal energies at these temperatures.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused between the energy levels and the thermal energy. Let me clarify.

The Boltzmann equation uses the energy difference between levels, which is E2 - E1. But in terms of temperature, the ratio (E2 - E1)/(k T) is critical. So, for E in eV, the ratio is (E2 - E1, eV) / ( (k*T) ), where k*T is in eV.

So, for example, at T=6000 K, k*T is approximately 0.0008617 eV/K * 6000 K ≈ 5.17 eV.

Wait, no. Wait, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So k*T for T=6000 K is 8.617e-5 *6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

Wait no, 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = (8.617e-5 * 6e3) eV = 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 0.517 eV.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T) = 8.57 eV / 0.517 eV ≈ 16.58.

Similarly, for T=5500 K, k*T=8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV. So (E2-E1)/(k T) = 8.57 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.09.

Wait, but this can't be right because earlier I thought that energy in eV is higher than k*T. So for these temperatures, the exponent is about 16 to 18, which is a very large number, leading the exponential term to be extremely small.

Wait, but wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is negative. So, for the case where E2 > E1, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would be exp(-16.58) ≈ 3e-8, and exp(-18.09)= approximately 1e-8. So n2/n1 is very small, meaning that n1 is much larger than n2.

But that's if E2 > E1.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Let's re-express that. So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If (E2-E1)/(k T) is about 16.58 at T=6000 K, then exp(16.58) is a gigantic number. Similarly, at 5500 K, it's even larger. So (n1/n2) would be enormous in both cases, but the ratio R1/R2 is the ratio of these numbers.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me compute R1 and R2.

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because (E2-E1)/(k) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) = approximately 99420 K.

So, 1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^-1.

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182 K^-1.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 ≈ 0.00001515 K^-1.

So the exponent is 99420 K * 0.00001515 K^-1 ≈ 1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.5.

Wait, that's about 4.5. Which is option C.

Wait, but wait, what's happening here. Because (E2-E1)/(k) is about 99,420 K. Then, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 0.00001515 K^-1.

So 99,420 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.506.

So exp(1.506) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the ratio without spots is 4.5 times the ratio with spots. So the ratio decreases by a factor of 4.5.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 is with spots. So R1 = 4.5 * R2. So the factor is 4.5. So the answer would be option C) ~4.5.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent.

(E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99420 K.

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

Multiply by (E2-E1)/(k) to get the exponent: 99420 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.506.

So exp(1.506) is e^1.506 ≈ 4.5.

Yes, that's correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, under the given conditions. The Boltzmann equation governs the population of these levels:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are their energies, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is used to calculate the energy difference \(\Delta E = E_1 - E_2\).

### Step 1: Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\))
The energy of a photon is given by:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \(\Delta E = 8.57 \, \text{eV}\).

### Step 2: Ratio of Populations
The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels is proportional to:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\) is the Boltzmann constant. For two temperatures, \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots present), the ratio of the ratios is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Exponent
First, calculate \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00016667 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.00018182 \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, calculate \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57 \, \text{eV}}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}} \approx 99420 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, compute the exponent:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = -(99420)(-0.00001515) \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 4: Final Ratio
The ratio of the populations is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
