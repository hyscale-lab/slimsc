Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are provided: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV, and I guess the neutrino is massless, or at least its mass is negligible compared to the others. 

Wait, so the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products must also be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino should have equal and opposite momenta. But since the neutrino has a very small mass (probably considered zero here), its momentum would be much larger than the muon's. Hmm, but maybe for the sake of this problem, we can treat the neutrino's mass as zero.

So, the process is: Pi(+) → mu+ + nu. Pi is at rest, so all the initial energy is its rest mass energy. After decay, the muon will have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino will have some as well.

I remember that in particle decays, the total energy is conserved, so the sum of the energies of the products equals the rest energy of the initial particle. But wait, the initial particle is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

So, let's denote:

E_pi = 139.6 MeV (total energy, since it's stationary)
m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu
E_nu = K_nu

Since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of the momenta of mu and nu must be equal because their directions are opposite. So:

p_mu = p_nu = p

But for the muon, p = sqrt( (E_mu²/c²) - (m_mu² c²) ) / c²? Wait, maybe I should think in natural units where c=1. So, momentum p_mu = sqrt( E_mu² - m_mu² ). Similarly, since the neutrino's mass is zero, p_nu = E_nu.

But also, since p_mu = p_nu, we can write:

sqrt( E_mu² - m_mu² ) = E_nu

So, E_mu = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + m_mu^2 )

But wait, that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, since the total energy is E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

So:

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV

And from momentum conservation:

E_mu² - m_mu² = (E_nu)^2

Because p_mu = p_nu, and in natural units, E² = p² + m².

So substituting E_nu from the first equation into the second.

Let me denote E_nu as x. Then E_mu = 139.6 - x.

So, (139.6 - x)^2 - (105.7)^2 = x^2.

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x² - (105.7)^2 = x^2

The x² terms cancel out.

So,

(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 - 2*139.6 x = 0

Let me compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: 100^2 is 10,000. 5.7^2 is 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10,000 + 1140 +32.49=11172.49.

So,

19488.16 - 11172.49 =  (139.6^2 -105.7^2) = 8315.67.

So,

8315.67 - 2*139.6 x = 0

Solving for x:

2*139.6 x =8315.67 → x = 8315.67/(2*139.6 )

Calculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 → Let me compute that.

8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me think, 279 * 30 is 8370, which is a bit more than 8315. So approximately 29.7 or something.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = let me compute 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16, which is close to 8315.67. So approximately x is around 29.8.

So, x is E_nu ≈29.8 MeV.

Then E_mu = 139.6 - x ≈ 139.6 -29.8=109.8 MeV.

Wait but the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is approximately 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's close to our calculated values. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for x.

Wait, the equation was:

(139.6 -x)^2 - (105.7)^2 = x^2.

So expanding (139.6 -x)^2:

= 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x²

Thus,

139.6² -2*139.6 x + x² -105.7² = x² → 139.6² -105.7² = 2*139.6 x.

Compute 139.6^2 = 19488.16, 105.7^2=11172.49.

19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2*139.6 x =8315.67 → x=8315.67/(2*139.6) → 8315.67/(279.2)= approximately.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376 -279.2= 8096.8.

But 29 times 279.2 is 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.

8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ approximately 0.783.

So x≈29.783 MeV.

Which rounds to 29.8 MeV. So E_nu is about 29.8.

Thus, the muon's kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV. So the KE of mu is 4.1, neutrino is 29.8.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 and 29.8. So that's the correct one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy:  
\[
E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass of \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy of the products equals the total energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Here, \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}\) (rest energy of the muon plus its kinetic energy), and \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\) (kinetic energy of the neutrino).

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Using the relativistic relation \(E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\), we have:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = \sqrt{E_{\mu}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4}, \quad p_{\nu} = E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Equating the momenta:  
   \[
   \sqrt{E_{\mu}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4} = E_{\nu}.
   \]

### Solving for Energies
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Let \(E_{\nu} = x\). Then \(E_{\mu} = 139.6 - x\). Substituting into the momentum conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{(139.6 - x)^2 - (105.7)^2} = x.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
(139.6 - x)^2 - (105.7)^2 = x^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2 - 105.7^2 = x^2.
\]  
Canceling \(x^2\):  
\[
139.6^2 - 105.7^2 - 2(139.6)x = 0.
\]  
Calculating \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):  
\[
19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
8315.67 - 2(139.6)x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{8315.67}{2(139.6)}.
\]  
Solving:  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
So, \(E_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(E_{\mu} = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Kinetic Energies
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.1 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
