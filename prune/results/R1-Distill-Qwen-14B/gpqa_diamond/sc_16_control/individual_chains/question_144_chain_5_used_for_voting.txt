Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, in particle physics, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime τ. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, maybe it's Γ = ħ / τ. Because Γ is the energy width, and τ is the lifetime. So, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units. Let me think. Units-wise, Γ has units of energy, so when you take ħ (which is in units of energy*time) and divide by Γ (energy), you get time. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the mean decay distance. Oh right, particles can't exist for longer than their lifetime, so the mean decay length is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. So, L = v * τ.

Hmm, but to find v, the velocity of the meson, I need to know its energy and mass. Oh, right, because the meson is a resonance, it's produced with a certain energy, but since it's a boson (mesons are bosons), but wait, how is its velocity determined? Wait, perhaps I should treat it as a relativistic particle. So, the energy E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

The total energy E_X is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So, the particle is moving relativistically. To find velocity, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Solving for p, the momentum.

So, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Let me think in natural units where c=1. Then E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but since c=1, it's GeV. Hmm, but when doing calculations, I have to be careful with the units.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute everything in units where c=1, then convert to meters at the end.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the lifetime τ.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV: 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ.

But ħ in what units? Let me recall the value of ħ in GeV·s. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let's get the exact value. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s. Since ħ = h/(2π), ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But converting J to eV: 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So, 1 J·s = 1/(1.60218e-19 eV) s·eV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use known constants. I remember that ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, but that's another approach. Alternatively, ħ in GeV·s is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

0.32 is 3.2e-1, so 6.582e-25 / 3.2e-1 = (6.582/3.2) * 1e-24. 6.582/3.2 is approximately 2.056875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, is that correct? Because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582e-25) / 3.2e-1) = 6.582/(3.2) * 1e-24.

Yes, 6.582 /3.2 is about 2.056875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. The width Γ is the total decay width, which relates to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). That seems correct.

But wait, I think it's more accurate to remember that τ is the lifetime, and Γ is the width, which is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ.

So, with ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ = 0.32 GeV, so τ is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, find the velocity of the meson. The energy is given as 8 GeV, mass is 1.2 GeV.

In natural units (c=1), E = sqrt(p² + m²). So, p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV.

Compute 8^2=64, 1.2^2=1.44. 64-1.44=62.56. sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. Wait, but units? Actually, in natural units, p is in GeV/c, E in GeV. So, p ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

But velocity v is given in terms of c. So, v = p c / E.

Because, in natural units, E = gamma m c², p = gamma m v, so v = (p c) / E. Wait, let me think. Wait, in natural units, c=1, so E² = p² + m². So, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Then, the velocity is v = p c / E. Since E is in GeV, p in GeV/c, so v = (GeV/c * c) / GeV = 1. So, that's dimensionless, but v is a fraction of c.

Wait, more accurately, v = (p c^2) / E.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute beta (β) which is v/c. From relativistic mechanics, β = p c / E.

So, β = (p c) / E.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. In natural units, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², p in GeV/c.

Wait, let's compute β.

β = p c / E.

Wait, p is in GeV/c, so p c is in GeV. So, β = (GeV/c * c) / GeV = (GeV) / GeV = unitless. So yes, that gives β as a fraction of c.

So, p = sqrt(8^2 - (1.2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c.

Then, β = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV = 7.91 /8 ≈0.98875.

So, v ≈ 0.98875 c. That's a high velocity, about 98.9% the speed of light.

Now, the mean decay length is L = v * τ.

But wait, need to make sure about units. Time is in seconds, velocity in m/s.

So, let's compute τ in seconds, v in m/s.

τ = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v = 0.98875 * c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, v ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * τ = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply that: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.96625 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.

Compute 2.96625 * 2.056875. Let me calculate that.

2 * 2 is 4.

2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's see, 3 * 2.056875 is about 6.170625, but since it's 2.96625, which is 3 - 0.03375, so 6.170625 - (0.03375 * 2.056875).

0.03375 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.069228.

So, 6.170625 - 0.069228 ≈6.101397.

So, L ≈6.101397e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, which is larger than any of the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I messed up with the calculation of Γ.

Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that part was correct.

Wait, maybe the calculation of velocity is wrong.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should use the mean lifetime as τ = ħ/(Γ), and the decay length is L = (v/c) * cτ, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length in terms of the particle's lifetime and velocity. Let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

Let me redo the calculation step by step.

Calculating β:

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c.

β = (p c) / E.

Wait, because E = gamma mc², and p = gamma m v. So, v = (p c) / E.

So, β = v/c = (p c)/(E).

So, p is 7.91 GeV/c, E is 8 GeV.

β = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV =7.91/8=0.98875, which is correct.

So, v = 0.98875 * c.

Now, the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 /0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, v is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.96625e8 m/s.

So, L = v * τ = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Calculating the product 2.96625 * 2.056875.

Let me compute it more accurately.

2.056875 * 3 is 6.170625.

But it's 2.96625, which is 3 - 0.03375.

So, 2.056875 * (3 - 0.03375) = 6.170625 - (2.056875 * 0.03375).

Compute 2.056875 * 0.03375:

0.03375 is 3375/1e5, but perhaps compute it as:

2 * 0.03375 = 0.0675,

0.056875 *0.03375: let me compute.

0.056875 *0.03375 ≈0.0019140625.

So total is 0.0675 +0.0019140625≈0.0694140625.

So, 6.170625 -0.0694140625≈6.1012109375.

So, product is approximately 6.10121e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option A (5.02e-16) and D (4.06e-16). Hmm, my calculation gives around 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have this. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the product.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.96625 * 2.056875 in a more precise way.

Let me compute 2.96625 * 2.056875.

We can break it down:

2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325

2.96625 * 0.056875 = ?

Let me compute 2.96625 * 0.056875.

0.056875 is 56875e-6, or 56875/1e6 = 9.1/160 (wait, probably easier to compute directly.

Compute 2.96625 * 0.056875:

= (3 - 0.03375) * 0.056875

= 3 * 0.056875 - 0.03375 * 0.056875

= 0.170625 - (approx 0.0019140625)

= approx 0.1687109375.

So, 2.96625 * 2.056875 = 5.9325 + 0.1687109375 = 6.0997109375.

So, approximately 6.0997e-16 m.

Hmm, same as before. So, around 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for mean decay length is different. Oh wait, the formula I used is L = v * τ, but that's correct because in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so it travels a distance v multiplied by its lifetime.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps I should use the proper time. No, because τ is the mean lifetime, which is the proper time (time in the particle's rest frame). So when you multiply by velocity, you get the distance in the lab frame.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity. Let me re-examine that.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c.

β = p c / E = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV.

Wait, GeV cancels, c cancels, so it's 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So, β is 0.98875, correct. So v = 0.98875 c.

Hmm.

Wait, what if I made a mistake in units when calculating β?

Wait, another approach: calculate the velocity using beta = sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

Because, E² = p² c² + m² c^4 → (E/(c²))² = (p/c)^2 + m² → (E/(c²))² - m² = (p/c)^2 → p = c * sqrt( (E/(c²))^2 - m^2 )

But perhaps beta is sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

Yes, because beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² E^2)/(E^2)) ) = sqrt(1-(m^2/E^2)).

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)).

1.44/64 = 0.0225.

So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, tau is ħ / Γ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV, so tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the full expression for tau involving the natural line width and other constants.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use relativistic gamma factor when calculating the lifetime. Because, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Wait, no. The lifetime tau is the proper lifetime (in the particle's rest frame), which is given by tau = ħ / Gamma. Because Gamma is the total decay width, which is energy, and in the rest frame.

So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is the same as tau, because time dilation applies to the lifetime. Wait, no, because the particle is moving, its lifetime in the lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma. But wait, the mean lifetime we're using is the proper time, right? Because the decay width is measured in the rest frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think. The width Γ is the same in all frames, but the lifetime (proper time) tau is related to the width by Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau is the proper lifetime.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, because of time dilation. So, the observed lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.

So, the decay length is v multiplied by the observed lifetime (gamma * tau).

Ah, that's where I might have gone wrong. I didn't account for time dilation.

So, let me correct that.

So, the proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma.

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

Because the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer.

So, the mean decay length L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but how do I compute gamma?

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c^2). Since in natural units, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², c=1.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 ≈6.6666667.

Wait, that's a significant factor. So, gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So, the observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

6.6667 *2 =13.3334; 6.6667 *0.056875= 0.379166.

So 13.3334 + 0.379166 =13.71256e-24 → 1.371256e-23 s.

Wait, wait, no, 2.056875e-24 *6.6667= ?

Let me compute:

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6.6667 * 2.056875) e-24.

Compute 6.6667 *2.056875.

6*2=12.

6*0.056875≈0.34125.

0.6667 *2.056875≈approximately 1.371.

So, 6 *2.056875=12.34125.

Plus 0.6667 *2.056875≈1.371.

Total ≈13.71225.

So, 13.71225e-24 s =1.371225e-23 s.

So, now L = v * (gamma tau).

v is 0.98875 c.

So, v is approximately 0.98875 *3e8 m/s ≈2.96625e8 m/s.

So, L= 2.96625e8 m/s *1.371225e-23 s = ?

Multiply 2.96625e8 *1.371225e-23 = (2.96625 *1.371225) *1e-15.

Calculate 2.96625 *1.371225.

Let me compute:

2 *1.371225=2.74245.

0.96625 *1.371225= ?

Compute 0.9 *1.371225=1.2341025.

0.06625 *1.371225 ≈0.091013.

So, 1.2341025 + 0.091013 ≈1.3251155.

So total is 2.74245 +1.3251155≈4.0675655.

So, L ≈4.0675655e-15 meters.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So, 4.067e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. The slight discrepancy is due to approximation in calculations.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we proceed as follows:

### Key Parameters:
- **Energy of X**: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Mass of X**: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Width of X**: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Step 1: Mean Lifetime (\( \tau \))
The mean lifetime of the particle is related to its width by the formula:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Velocity of the Meson (\( v \))
The velocity is determined using relativistic mechanics. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:
\[
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4
\]
In natural units (\( c = 1 \)), this simplifies to:
\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2}
\]
Substituting \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
p = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV/c}
\]
The velocity \( v \) is given by:
\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{p}{E}
\]
Substituting \( p = 7.91 \, \text{GeV/c} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
\]
Thus:
\[
v \approx 0.98875 \, c \approx 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))
The mean decay distance is the product of the velocity and the lifetime:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]
Substituting \( v \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1012 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Adjusting for Time Dilation
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. In the lab frame, the observed lifetime is longer by a factor of the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), where:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]
Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]
The observed lifetime in the lab frame is:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]
The mean decay distance is then:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0675655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
Comparing with the options, the closest value is:
\[
\boxed{4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}}
\]

**Answer: B**
