Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I need to think this through. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup is a bit tricky. So there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; it's shifted by a distance s. So the conductor's center and the cavity's center are separated by s. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, the arrangement must be such that the conductor's center, the cavity's center, and point P form some sort of triangle? Maybe.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh right, but the conductor is a conductor, so any excess charge would reside on the surface, but since it's uncharged, perhaps the presence of the cavity's charge affects it.

Wait, in the case where a conductor has a cavity with a charge inside, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the inner surface must have an induced charge opposite to the cavity's charge. Let me think: if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have -q, right? Because the charges in the conductor will move to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. So the conductor's material itself is neutral, so the outer surface must also have zero net charge since the total conductor charge is zero.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor was uncharged, and the cavity has +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral. So the charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q, summing to zero. Or wait, no. Because the conductor's own charges were zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer will have +q, so that the total conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Wait, but in reality, for a conductor with a cavity, the inner surface charge is induced to be -q (if the charge in the cavity is +q), and the outer surface will have no charge because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, no, because the conductor's own charge is zero, so the inner surface has -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. Because conductor's own charge is zero: inner is -q, outer is +q, total is zero. Oh wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge of the conductor (inner and outer) sum to zero. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the conductor is neutral initially, and a charge +q is placed in the cavity, then the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's material itself must balance the charges.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so any induced charges must sum to zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero. So conductor's inner surface is -q, outer is +q, sum to zero.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q, because the conductor must cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. So the conductor's material itself must have zero net charge, so the outer surface must have +q, because (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but then, the conductor is outside the cavity, so the charge on the outer surface is +q. So when we're looking at a point outside the conductor (P, at L > R), the electric field would be due to the outer surface charge, which is +q. So the field at P would be as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor, right? Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor has a cavity whose center is shifted by s from the conductor's center. So the charge in the cavity is at a different point. How does that affect the induced charges and the field outside?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the method of images or some superposition. Alternatively, perhaps the field outside the conductor is the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. But wait, no, because the charge is inside a cavity whose center is displaced.

Wait, wait, perhaps the displacement of the cavity's center doesn't matter for the external field. Because when you have a spherical conductor, any charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface, but the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the symmetry. Wait, but in this case, if the cavity is not centered, perhaps the outer surface's charge distribution isn't symmetric anymore.

Wait, no. The conductor is a sphere, so regardless of where the cavity is located (even if it's not centered), the outer surface's charge distribution should still be symmetric. Because the conductor's material itself is a sphere, so any external fields would be due to the outer surface charge, which is symmetric as a sphere. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if the cavity is not centered, then the inner surface's charge distribution would not be uniform. But the conductor's own material is a sphere. So when a charge is placed in the cavity, the inner surface forms an induced charge that is opposite, but perhaps not symmetric, because the cavity is off-center. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so perhaps the charges redistribute in such a way that the outer surface still acts as a uniformly charged sphere.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the conductor's electrostatics. The conductor's interior (the cavity) has a charge q. This induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface must adjust to maintain the conductor's neutrality. So the outer surface would have +q, but how is that? Because the conductor's material is neutral, so the inner surface is -q, and the outer must have +q, so that the total charge is zero.

Wait, but wait, no. If the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q, then the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, because the conductor's material must have a net charge of zero. So the outer surface has +q. But the outer surface is a spherical shell, so the electric field outside the conductor (point P) would be as if all the charge of +q was at the center of the conductor, right? Because for a spherical shell, the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because the charge on the outer surface is +q, and the distance from P to the conductor's center is L.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says that E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would be the case if the field is due to the outer surface's charge. But wait, another thought: What if the displacement of the cavity affects this? Because the charge is placed in a cavity that's not at the center, maybe the field isn't just from the outer surface's charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the point P is outside, so the field is due to the outer surface's charge, which is symmetrically distributed. So the field at P is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. The charge on the outer surface is +q, so for any point outside (like P), the electric field would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the sphere. So regardless of where the cavity is located, the external field depends only on the outer surface's charge and the distance from the center.

So in this case, the answer should be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q / l², where l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. That would be the case if the field was due to the charge in the cavity, but that's inside the conductor. No, because for points outside the conductor, you can't have the field just due to the inner charge. The conductor's outer surface's charge is what contributes.

So the correct field should depend on L, the distance from the conductor's center. Hence, option B is correct.

But wait, another angle: The conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, but where exactly is that charge located? It's on the surface of the conductor. So the field at P would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So the calculation would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L². So option B.

So looking at the options:

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², which matches what we just found.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, with a cavity of radius $r$ whose center is displaced by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material). Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface. The outer surface charge is $+q$, and the field at a point outside the conductor depends only on this charge and the distance from the center of the conductor. The displacement of the cavity's center does not affect the external field because the outer surface charge is symmetrically distributed.

4. **Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression depends on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are irrelevant for the external field.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Similar to Option A, this depends on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are not relevant for the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. This expression depends on $l$, the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, which is not relevant for the external field.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
