Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to bind effectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects much here. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. K is the formation constant, I think. So that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, the setup is that Ca²+ and EDTA form a complex, and we need to find [Ca²+] when the complex concentration is 0.02 M.

I remember that the formation constant Kf is given by the equation:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA])

Wait, but EDTA is in solution, and when it complexes with Ca²+, the free EDTA might be much lower. So, assuming that almost all the EDTA is tied up in the complex, except for a tiny bit. But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think.

Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA. So, the complex is CaEDTA²− or something like that. So, the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But in solution, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. However, I think that in many cases, the concentration of free EDTA is much smaller than the concentration of the complex, especially when Kf is very large. But wait, here the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the initial situation.

Wait, the solution contains only the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The other species would be very small. So, let me set up an ICE table. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium.

Initial concentrations:
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4−] = 0
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M

Change:
As the complex dissociates (since Kf is so large, but wait, Kf is very large, meaning the complex is stable. Wait, wait. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, so a large Kf means that the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. Hmm, so in this case, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So, the reverse reaction would dominate? No, no, Kf is for the formation, so large Kf means the complex stays formed.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of free Ca²+. If Kf is very large (like 5e10), then the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are going to be very small.

Wait, but in the problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So, let's think about it.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [C] = 0.02 M.

The dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The K for this reaction is 1/Kf, because Kf is the formation constant. So K for dissociation is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small, because K is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA] = x

So, K = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA²−] = (x * x) / 0.02 = x² /0.02 = 2e-11.

So, x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, let me compute it.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*1e-13. sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers.

Calculating x² = (2e-11) * 0.02. Wait, no, wait. Wait, K = x²/(0.02) = 2e-11.

So x squared is 2e-11 * 0.02.

Wait, 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is 6.32e-7. So yeah, that's correct.

So the answer is option C: 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), so the dissociation constant \( K \) is:

\[
K = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations are related by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and dissociation is minimal (\( x \ll 0.02 \)), the equilibrium concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
