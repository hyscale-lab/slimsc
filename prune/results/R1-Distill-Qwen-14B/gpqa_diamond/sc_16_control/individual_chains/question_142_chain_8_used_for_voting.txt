Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, I should think about what this particular matrix represents.

I think a density matrix for a pure state would be a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, right? But here, ρ is a sum of two projectors multiplied by 1/2. So, this must be a mixed state because it's a convex combination of pure states.

Wait, more specifically, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the basis states. So this ρ is a statistical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2. That makes sense because when you take the trace, you get 1, which is a requirement for density matrices.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on this part. Oh right, the Bloch sphere! The geometrical representation of a qubit state is on a Bloch sphere. For a pure state, it's a point on the surface, and for a mixed state, it's inside the sphere.

So, how do we represent the density matrix in Bloch vector terms? I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.

Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, the density matrix can be expressed as:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2

Comparing this with the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute what that is in matrix form. The |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, wait a second. So ρ = I/2. But from the Bloch sphere expression, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If I set them equal:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + r·σ

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = r·σ

Which implies that r must be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. But wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, the origin corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because this ρ is a maximally mixed state. So it's the center of the sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which is the origin. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, just to double-check. Let me think again about the Bloch vector. The density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So, if ρ is I/2, then the coefficients of the Pauli matrices must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero, so r is (0,0,0). Yep, that's correct. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, as it is a statistical mixture of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must all be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this would represent a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this corresponds to the origin, representing the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
