Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully and break it down.

So the question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots are present. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops from 6000K to 5500K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, and we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations n1/n2 depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(−ΔE/(k T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower (5500K instead of 6000K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. That makes sense because at lower temperatures, the exponential factor decreases, making n1/n2 smaller. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler, leading to a lower ratio.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, it's lower. We need to find the ratio of the no-spot case to the spot case, i.e., (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me think about the given data. The Teff without spots is 6000 K, and with spots covering 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, how does that 40% coverage affect the effective temperature? Does it average the temperature of the spotted and unspotted regions?

Wait, the problem states that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is lower when spots are present, but I'm not sure if that's because the spots are cooler, making the average Teff lower.

But the crucial part is about the photospheric effective temperature. The spots themselves are cooler, so the rest of the surface must be hotter? Or wait, no—wait, maybe the spots are cooler regions on the star. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, the overall effective temperature of the star (as seen from afar) drops. So the unspotted regions must be hotter than the average? Or maybe the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots? Wait, no, that might not make sense. Because the effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux. So the 5500 K is the effective temperature when 40% is covered.

Alternatively, perhaps each spot has a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Let me think: the effective temperature is a weighted average in some way. But maybe the star's photosphere when spotted has a lower average temperature. But for the purpose of the problem, perhaps it's sufficient to consider the temperature as 6000 K when no spots, and 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, the question says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots lowers the overall Teff. So when spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K.

But for the purposes of the Boltzmann factor, each region of the photosphere (spotted or not) has its own temperature. But wait, the problem states that we are to examine the ratio in the stellar photosphere. So perhaps when spots are present, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature, and the rest is at a higher temperature. But for the element's ionization or excitation, each region would have its own conditions. However, the problem assumes LTE, so each region is in local thermal equilibrium, but the observed ratio would be an average over the whole surface.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let me think: when you have a mixture of regions with different temperatures, the overall ratio of populations would be a flux-weighted average? Or perhaps an area-weighted average. Wait, but the star emits flux based on the area and the temperature. So the observed equivalent width or line strength would be affected by the total emission, which is a sum over all regions.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So we're looking at the number ratio, but averaged over the entire photosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But that may not directly translate to the individual regions. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the overall photosphere's temperature as 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not make sense because the spots are cooler than the rest. So perhaps the photospheric regions without spots are at higher temperature, say T1, and the spots are at T2, which is lower. But the problem gives us that when 40% is covered, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem asks about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So in the no-spots case, the photosphere is at 6000 K (T1 = 6000 K), and when spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K (but what's the temperature of the regions without spots?)

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But that seems unlikely because the spots are cooler than the surrounding. Alternatively, maybe the 5500 K is the average of the spotted and unspotted regions.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, it's better to model each region separately. Let me think. Suppose the unspotted regions have a higher temperature, T1, and the spotted regions have a lower temperature, T2. The overall effective temperature when 40% is covered is 5500 K.

Wait, the effective temperature of a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So the total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

If 40% of the surface is covered by spots, and the rest 60% is uncovered. Let me denote the fraction as f = 0.4.

Let me denote the temperature of the spotted regions as T_spot and the rest as T_unspot. The star's total luminosity is then L = L_spot + L_unspot.

L_spot = f * 4π R² σ T_spot^4 * (f), since the area is f * 4π R².

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average. The total luminosity would be the sum from each part.

So, the total luminosity without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the total luminosity L1 is:

L1 = 0.6 * (4π R² σ T_unspot^4) + 0.4 * (4π R² σ T_spot^4).
But the effective temperature when spots are present is Teff = 5500 K. So,

L1 = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

Setting them equal:

0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = (5500)^4.

But we don't know T_spot or T_unspot. Hmm, but perhaps I can make an assumption here. Maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. So T_unspot = 6000 K, and T_spot is lower.

So, let's plug in T_unspot = 6000 K into the equation.

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

Compute each term:

(6000)^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

(5500)^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4 is 5.5 *5.5=30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; 166.375 *5.5≈915.0625. So 915.0625e12 ≈9.150625e14.

So,

0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14.

Compute 0.6 *1.296e15: 0.6 *1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So,

7.776e14 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract:

0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. Let's take logarithms.

Log10(3.4365625e14) = log10(3.4365625) +14 ≈ 0.536 +14 =14.536.

Divide by 4: 14.536/4 ≈3.634.

10^3.634 ≈ approx 4300 K.

Wait, 10^0.634 is about 4.27. 10^3.634 is 4.27e3, so 4270 K.

So T_spot ≈4270 K.

Hmm, but wait, that's a pretty big drop. So the spots are at about 4270 K, and the rest of the star is at 6000 K.

But I'm not sure if this is necessary for the problem. Because the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. So how does the presence of spots affect this ratio?

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 depends on the temperature. When there are spots, the photosphere has regions at different temperatures. So the overall ratio would be a weighted average based on the number of atoms in each region. Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature is the same for all regions, but that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler.

Wait, but the problem says that the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So I'm not sure if the entire photosphere is at 5500 K or if it's a combination of higher and lower temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying the scenario by treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be accurate because the spots are cooler.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So the presence of spots lowers the overall Teff.

But for the purpose of the calculation, perhaps we can model the photosphere as being at 6000 K in the no-spot case and 5500 K in the spotted case. Because when the star has spots, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but the photosphere itself isn't at 5500 K uniformly. Only part of it is at a lower temperature. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So perhaps the overall photosphere's average ratio is what matters.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at the effective temperature, which is 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be correct. Because the effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation, not the temperature of the emitting regions.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we're supposed to use the effective temperatures as the temperatures for the photosphere in each case.

So, in the no-spot case, T1 = 6000 K.

In the spotted case, T2 = 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered, but individual regions have different temperatures.

But maybe the problem is asking us to consider the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, let's read the question again: "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K."

Ah, so the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So the entire photosphere (as a whole) is at 5500 K? No, that can't be. Because the spots are cooler regions, so the rest must be hotter for the average to be 5500 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply giving the overall effective temperature of the star when considering both spotted and unspotted regions. So the average T_eff is 5500 K in the spotted case.

But for the Boltzmann equation, each region has its own temperature. So when spots are present, 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature (T_spot) and 60% is at a higher temperature (T_unspot), with T_unspot higher than 6000 K. Wait, no, because when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower than 6000 K. So the unspotted regions must be hotter than 6000 K?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if spots are cooler, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K, the overall Teff would be lower than 6000 K. So that would fit with the given data.

Wait, perhaps in the spotted case, the unspotted regions are at the same temperature as when no spots are present, i.e., 6000 K. But then the spots are at a lower temperature, T_spot, which we calculated earlier as approximately 4270 K.

So then, in the spotted case, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% is at about 4270 K.

But then, how does this affect the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels?

Because the photosphere is a combination of these regions, the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions. Wait, because the flux emitted from each area depends on the temperature.

Wait, but the number of atoms in each energy level depends on the local temperature. So for the regions without spots (60% of the surface at 6000 K), the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), where T1=6000 K.

For the spotted regions (40% surface at T_spot=4270 K), the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_spot)).

So the overall ratio would be a sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their respective areas and the number of atoms in each region.

Wait, but the number of atoms contributing to the observed line depends on both the area and the temperature. Each region emits based on its temperature, but the number of atoms in each energy level depends on the local temperature.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering the entire photosphere as being at the effective temperature (6000 K and 5500 K), but that would be incorrect because the effective temperature is an average of the emitted flux, not the actual photospheric temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, so we can model it as T=5500 K in the spotted case and T=6000 K when no spots. That would make it easier, even if it's not entirely accurate.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere is a mix of cooler and hotter regions.

But for the Boltzmann ratio, each region has its own ratio. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average. Because the flux from each region depends on T^4, which affects how much each contributes to the observed line.

Wait, for a line transition, the equivalent width or the strength depends on the flux emitted in that line. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the ratios from each region.

So, let's model it as two regions: 60% at T1=6000 K and 40% at T_spot=4270 K.

The flux from each region is proportional to (Teff_region)^4 * area_fraction.

Wait, but the area is already 60% and 40%, so the flux fractions would be:

Flux_unspot = 0.6 * (T1^4 / T_eff_spotted^4) * (T_eff_spotted^4) ) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the contribution to the line emission. Each region emits with a certain flux in the line, which depends on the population ratio and the continuum emission. The population ratio depends on the local temperature.

But the problem might be assuming that the Ti atoms are in LTE in their respective regions, so the ratio in each region is determined by their local T.

So for each region, the ratio n1/n2 is:

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the observed ratio would be a weighted average of R1 and R2, weighted by the contribution of each region to the overall line emission.

The line emission (equivalent width) is proportional to the number of atoms in a particular state and the transition rate. However, the excitation temperature may cause each region to contribute differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio is a sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their respective areas. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is much simpler. The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the ratio is lower at 5500 K than at 6000 K. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not. Then, the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the factor would be R_no_spots / R_spots = exp( ΔE/(k T_spot) - ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spots) ) )

Wait, but wait: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), because g1 and g2 are constants for the energy levels.

So the factor is [exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots ) ) ] 

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio R1/R2, where R1 is for T1=6000 K, R2 for T2=5500 K.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. So for the purpose of the problem, we can assume that R_spots is computed at T=5500 K, and R_no_spots at T=6000 K.

If that's the case, then the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots.

Because R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), the factor is:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) ) 

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) )

We can compute this.

But wait, to compute this, we need to find the energy difference ΔE corresponding to the transition at wavelength 1448 Å.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divided by 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, 1448 Å is about 0.1448 microns, which is near the UV range. So the energy being about 8.56 eV makes sense because E (eV) ≈ 1240 / wavelength (nm). 1240 / 144.8 ≈8.56 eV.

Yes, correct.

So ΔE ≈8.56 eV.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, we use the energy in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (~8.617e-5 eV/K).

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99332 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,332 K.

Now, compute the exponent:

(1/T_spots) - (1/T_no_spots) → assuming T_spots is 5500 K and T_no_spots is 6000 K.

So,

1/5500 = 0.000181818 K^-1,

1/6000 = 0.000166667 K^-1.

Difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiply by ΔE/(k):

99332 K * 0.000015151 K^-1 ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ 4.5.

Because exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(1.5) is about 4.481, which is approximately 4.5.

So the ratio R_no_spots/R_spots is exp(1.506) ≈4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's R_no_spots / R_spots = 4.5.

But wait, earlier when I considered the spotted case as T=5500 K, that's under the assumption that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But earlier, I calculated that when spots cover 40% of the surface, the unspotted regions are at 6000 K and the spotted regions at ~4270 K.

If that's the case, then the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average between the two regions.

Wait, but that complicates things a lot. So perhaps I should go back to the initial approach.

Alternative approach: The ratio observed is the average of the ratios from each region, weighted by their contribution to the line emission.

But for line emission, the equivalent width depends on the number of absorbers and the transition probability, which is a function of temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalent width from each region would be proportional to the number of atoms in the upper state (n2) times the transition probability (which depends on T).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. But perhaps the problem expects us to proceed as if the entire photosphere is at the given Teff.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended approach is to use T=6000 K and T=5500 K for the no-spots and spotted cases, respectively, and compute the ratio of the ratios.

Which gives a factor of about 4.5, option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations \( n_1/n_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **No spots**: Effective temperature \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
2. **With spots**: Effective temperature \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \).
3. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), which gives \( \Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV} \) using \( E = hc/\lambda \).
4. Boltzmann's constant \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \).

### Ratio of Ratios:
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \left(\frac{1}{kT_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{kT_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting:
- \( \Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \),
- \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \),
- \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \),
- \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \),

we calculate:

\[
\Delta E / k = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,332 \, \text{K}.
\]

The temperature terms are:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The difference is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 \approx 0.0000152 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = 99,332 \cdot 0.0000152 \approx 1.506.
\]

The factor is:

\[
\exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

**Answer: C**
