Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asks for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. 

Let me read the problem again. Right, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, which one is the reference frame here? Oh, right, the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, I think I need to find how fast A is moving relative to B.

Wait, no, wait. Or maybe I should think about it the other way around. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be the difference in their speeds divided by that factor. Let me get the formula right. So, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). 

So plugging in v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. Let me compute the numerator first: 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c. Then the denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's calculate that. 0.6 *0.5=0.3. So 0.3c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1-0.3=0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. I remember that the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, no, the total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m * c². So I need to calculate the gamma for each and add the energies.

Wait, wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m moving at 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c. So (v/c)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy for the first astronaut is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m, moving at 0.5c. So v²/c² is 0.25. 1 -0.25=0.75. Square root is about sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So the energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy is 5.96 mc².

Now looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc².

So the correct relative speed is 0.14c (since 0.1428 is approximately 0.14), and the energy is 5.96, so option C.

Wait wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the relative velocity. Because sometimes the formula can be tricky. So v1 and v2 are both in the same direction, so v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). 

Plugging in 0.6c and 0.5c:

v1 - v2 = 0.1c.

v1*v2 = 0.6*0.5 = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c, as I had before. So that's correct.

And the energy sum: 2.5 + 3.464 is indeed about 5.964, which is 5.96 mc². So option C is the right choice.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

1. Numerator: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. Denominator: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

Adding the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
