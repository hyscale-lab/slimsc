Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

The problem says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Hmm, point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Oh right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is what we're looking for here. Since energy is involved, and the system is isolated, I think it's about calculating the electric potential energy between the charges.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so no work is done from the outside, but the setup is given. So I need to find the potential energy of all the charges in this configuration.

Each particle has a charge of 2e. Let's note down the values:

e = 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e, which is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Wait, but when calculating potential energy between two point charges, the formula is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. Right, Coulomb's law for potential energy.

But in a system of multiple charges, we need to calculate the potential energy between each pair. Because each pair contributes to the total potential energy. So for n charges, it's the sum of potential energies for each distinct pair.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between each of these pairs is the same.

Additionally, the 12 charges are each at 2 meters apart from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement relative to each other. Hmm, that's a point I need to consider. If they're all 2 meters from P, perhaps they are arranged in a sphere around P.

Wait, but for the potential energy between the 12 charges, since they are each 2 meters from P, the distance between any two of them would be greater than 2 meters. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the 12 charges are all at the same point (which is not possible physically, but maybe for the sake of calculation, we consider them as point charges at the same location). Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not between the other 12 charges themselves. Wait, that might not be right because the system's total energy would include all interactions.

Wait, but the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So the distance from each of the 12 to P is fixed, but their mutual distances could vary. But calculating the potential energy between all pairs would involve knowing all the distances between every pair, which complicates things. But the question is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energy between the 12 is minimized. Hmm, but wait, how?

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. Each pair of the 12 charges would contribute some positive or negative energy. But since each charge is 2e, the product q1 q2 is (2e)(2e) = 4e². So if the charges are like that, then the potential energy between each pair is positive (since k is positive and r is positive). So the more the 12 charges are close to each other, the higher the potential energy (since U is positive and increases as r decreases). Therefore, to minimize the total potential energy of the system, we need to maximize the distances between the 12 charges, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps their mutual distances are not fixed, but I'm not sure.

Wait a minute, maybe the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves is not considered, because the problem doesn't mention any constraint on their mutual arrangement. Hmm, or perhaps it's implied that they are all at the same point, but that can't be right because that would create a huge potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the only interactions contributing significantly are between the 13th charge and the 12 others. But that doesn't make sense, because each of the 12 charges would have interactions with each other as well.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the scenario by considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and neglecting the potential energy between the 12 charges among themselves. But that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states it's an isolated system, and asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the system's energy includes all possible interactions.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are all located at the same point, 2 meters from P. But that would make the distance between any two of them zero, but that's impossible because point charges can't be at the same point without infinite potential energy. So perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each fixed at 2 meters from P, but arranged in a way that their mutual distances don't contribute significantly, or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

Wait, perhaps I should read the problem again. The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. So perhaps the problem is treating them as all being at the same point, but that's not possible because their mutual potential energy would be enormous.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are placed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, each at a point on the sphere, but their exact arrangement isn't given. But without knowing their positions, it's impossible to calculate their mutual potential energy. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

But that can't be right because the system's total potential energy would include all the pairs: the 13th with each of the 12, and each of the 12 with each other.

Wait, but maybe the problem is designed so that the 12 charges are all placed at the same point, but that would mean that each pair of them is at zero distance, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is making the assumption that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P and are at rest, but their mutual distances are such that their potential energy can be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is such that the 12 charges are placed at 2 meters from P but arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is zero or minimized, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, so the mutual potential energy between the 12 is neglected. That might be a possible approach, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. But that would be a sphere, but each charge would have multiple neighbors at 2 meters. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others. Let me think about that.

So, the 13th charge is at P. Each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) multiplied by 12, because each of the 12 contributes.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for each pair between the 13th and each of the 12, the potential energy is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). So for each pair, that's U = k*(4e²)/2 = 2k e².

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy from these interactions would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Each pair among the 12 would contribute. So there are C(12,2) = 66 pairs. Each pair has a charge of 2e each, so the product is 4e². The distance between any two charges among the 12 is not given, but if they're all at 2 m from P, their mutual distance could be more than 2 m, but perhaps for the sake of calculation, we can assume they are all placed on a sphere such that the distance between any two is the same. Wait, but without that information, maybe the problem is ignoring this part, considering it negligible or zero.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy", so perhaps the potential energy between the 12 is minimized. How? Since the potential energy between two positive charges is positive and U = k*q1*q2/r. So to minimize the total potential energy, we need to maximize the distance between each pair of the 12, because that would make each U as small as possible (since U is positive, making r larger reduces U).

But the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are on a sphere of radius 2 m, but their mutual distances can vary. The maximum possible distance between any two of them would be the diameter, 4 m, but arranging all of them to be as far apart as possible would require a specific configuration, perhaps a regular polyhedron arrangement. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is making the assumption that the mutual distances are all the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged such that the mutual potential energy is minimized, which would be when they are as far apart as possible, but without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not considering the mutual potential between the 12.

But that seems unlikely because the total system's potential energy would include all interactions.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. Hmm, that's possible only if they are arranged symmetrically, such as in a regular structure where the potential energies cancel out. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero, but that's only possible if they're arranged in a way that their repulsion is balanced, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero or negligible, and focus on the potential energy between the 13th and the 12.

Wait, but that can't be right because each of the 12 is a positive charge, so their mutual repulsion would contribute positive potential energy. So neglecting that would give an incorrect total energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges because it's negligible or because the question is designed in a way that the 12 are fixed in place, so their mutual distances are fixed and known, but I don't have those values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not considering the mutual interactions between the 12.

But then, the total potential energy would be the sum of those interactions. Let me compute that.

So, for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the 13th charge is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m). So each pair contributes U = k*(4 e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Hmm, but wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)(2e)/r, where r is the distance between them. Since I don't know r, perhaps the problem is assuming that r is very large, making their mutual potential energy negligible. But the problem states that each is 2 m from P, but not from each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and not considering the mutual potential between the 12, which might make sense if they are arranged in a way that their contributions are either zero or can't be determined without more information.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energy between the 12 is zero, but that's only possible in certain arrangements, which I'm not familiar with.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they form a regular dodecahedron or something, so that the potential energy is minimized. But without knowing the exact distances, this is difficult.

Wait, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they can't occupy the same point. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation, ignoring the mutual potential energy between the 12. Let me proceed under that assumption for now.

So, the total potential energy U would be the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

So, U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 / 2 m )

Let me compute this. Let's plug in the numbers.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So, (2e) = 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes:

U = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2 * 2)

Wait, wait, because the distance is 2 meters.

Wait, so each term is (8.988e9) * (2e * 2e) / (2) )

So (2e)^2 is (4e²), which is (4) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each part step by step.

Calculating each U_i (for each of the 12):

U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m)

So U_i = k * (4 e²) / (2) = 2 k e².

So for 12 pairs, U_total = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, plug in the numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

So, e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Therefore, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute that.

First, compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiplying these gives 8.988 * 2.566 = let's compute that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ about 2.536.

Wait, wait, actually, 8.988 * 2.566:

Let me compute more accurately:

2.566 * 8 = 20.528

2.566 * 0.988 ≈ 2.534 (since 2.566 * 1 = 2.566, subtract 2.566 * 0.012=0.030792, so 2.566 - 0.030792 ≈ 2.5352.

So total is approximately 20.528 + 2.5352 = 23.0632.

So that's 23.0632e(9 -38) = 23.0632e-29.

Wait, 10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^(-29).

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 23.0632e-29.

Now, multiply by 24.

24 * 23.0632e-29 = ?

23.0632 *24 = let's compute.

20 *24=480

3.0632 *24=73.5168

Total: 480 +73.5168 = 553.5168.

So 553.5168e-29 = 5.535168e-26 J.

So U_total ≈ 5.535 x 10^-26 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.645 x 10^-26, which is close, but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in some steps.

Wait, let me re-calculate the multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Wait, let's recompute 8.988 *2.566.

Wait, 8.988 * 2.566.

Let me compute 8 * 2.566=20.528.

0.988 * 2.566.

Compute 0.988 *2.566:

0.988 * 2 = 1.976.

0.988 * 0.566 = approx 0.988 * 0.5 = 0.494, 0.988 * 0.066 ≈ 0.0652. So total approx 0.5592.

So 1.976 +0.5592 = 2.5352.

So 8.988 *2.566 = 20.528 +2.5352=23.0632.

So that part is correct.

So 23.0632e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.0632 *24.

Let me compute 23 *24=552.

0.0632 *24=1.5168.

Total 552+1.5168=553.5168.

So 553.5168e-29 = 5.535168e-26 J.

So approximately 5.535e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is close but higher. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. If that's the case, my prior calculation might be incorrect.

Wait, because I assumed that the mutual potential energy is zero, but perhaps it's a significant positive value that I need to add.

But how can I compute that without knowing the distances between the 12 charges?

Wait, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps they are all at the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. So the distance between any two charges would be at least 2m (if they're on opposite ends) and up to 4m (the diameter). But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's tough to compute the mutual potential energy. 

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized, which would imply that they are as far apart as possible, which would be the case when they're on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, equally spaced. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps it's impossible to compute the mutual potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are symmetrically arranged, but that's only possible if their arrangement is such that the potential energy contributions from each pair cancel out, which isn't typically the case for point charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, but in that case, the answer would be around 5.535e-26 J, which is not exactly matching any option. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me go through the calculation again.

Each pair between the 13th charge and the 12 others has a potential energy of U = k*(2e)^2 / (2 m), right?

So U_i = k * (2e)^2 / (2 * 2) ?

Wait, wait, the distance is 2m, so the denominator is 2.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So U_i = (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So for each of the 12 pairs, U_i is 2 k e².

So the total from these is 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Now, let me compute this again with more precise numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602176634e-19 C (exact value, but using approximate 1.602e-19 for calculation).

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 x 1e-38 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38:

= (8.988 * 2.566) x 1e9 x 1e-38.

8.988 *2.566 = let's compute accurately.

8 *2.566=20.528.

0.988 *2.566: Let me compute 0.9 *2.566=2.3094; 0.08 *2.566=0.20528; 0.008 *2.566=0.020528. Summing: 2.3094 +0.20528 =2.51468 +0.020528=2.535208.

So total is 20.528 +2.535208=23.063208.

So 23.063208e-29 (because 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29).

Now multiply by 24: 23.063208 *24 = let's compute.

23 *24=552.

0.063208 *24=1.516992.

So total is 552 +1.516992=553.516992.

So 553.516992e-29 =5.53516992e-26 J.

So approximately 5.535e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26. Hmm, that's close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So each contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/ (2). So each pair's potential energy is correct.

Wait, 12 * (2ke²) =24 ke².

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the 12 are all at 2m from P, and all are the same charge, so each contributes the same amount.

Wait, but the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is something I'm not considering yet. Oh, that's right, because each of the 12 is a 2e charge, so each pair among them contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r, where r is the distance between them.

But without knowing r, perhaps I can't compute it. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So what's the minimal possible potential energy for the system? To minimize the total potential energy, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges would be as small as possible. Since each pair contributes a positive value (because both are positive charges), making the mutual distances as large as possible would minimize the total.

But the charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary. The maximum possible distance between any two would be 4m (diametrically opposite points on the sphere of radius 2m). But arranging all 12 charges such that each pair is as far apart as possible isn't feasible because each charge can't be at opposite ends from every other.

Wait, perhaps the minimal mutual potential energy occurs when the 12 charges are placed as far apart as possible on the sphere, which is a regular dodecahedron arrangement or something, but without knowing exact distances, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero or not contributing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy cancels out. For example, if they're arranged symmetrically around the 13th charge, but that's only possible if they're on a sphere and their arrangement is symmetric, but I'm not sure if that would zero out the mutual potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because all are positive charges.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each pair is at a distance r, but I'm not given that information. The problem only states that each is 2m from P, not from each other.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual potential. In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.535e-26 J, which is closest to option A, which is 5.645e-26. But there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the exact numbers again.

Let me compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiplying the coefficients: 8.988 *2.566.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Compute 8 * 2.566 =20.528.

0.988 *2.566: Let's compute 0.988 *2 =1.976; 0.988 *0.5 =0.494; 0.988 *0.066=0.0652.

Wait, 2.566 is 2 + 0.5 + 0.066.

So 0.988 *2.566 =0.988*(2 +0.5 +0.066) = (0.988*2) + (0.988*0.5) + (0.988*0.066).

=1.976 +0.494 +0.0652.

Adding these: 1.976 +0.494 =2.47; 2.47 +0.0652=2.5352.

So total 8.988 *2.566 =20.528 +2.5352 =23.0632.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.0632e-29 =2.30632e-28.

Wait, no. Wait, 10^9 *10^-38 =10^-29. So 23.0632e-29=2.30632e-28? No, wait. 23.0632e-29 is 2.30632e-28? Let me think: 23e-29 =2.3e-28.

Wait, 23e-29 is 2.3e-28 because moving the decimal one place to the left reduces the exponent by one. So 23.0632e-29 =2.30632e-28.

Wait, no, wait: 1e-29 * 23 =23e-29 =2.3e-28. Yes, because 23e-29=23*(1e-29)=2.3 *1e-28.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.0632e-29 =2.30632e-28.

Now multiply by 24: 2.30632e-28 *24 = (2.30632 *24) e-28.

2.30632 *24.

2 *24=48.

0.30632*24= 7.35168.

So 48 +7.35168=55.35168.

So 55.35168e-28 =5.535168e-27 J.

Wait, wait a second, that's 5.535e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27? No, option C is 7.056e-27.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 24 * (8.988e9 * 2.566e-38)=24 *23.0632e-29.

23.0632e-29 times 24 is (23.0632 *24) e-29.

23.0632 *24 = 553.5168.

So 553.5168e-29 =5.535168e-26 J.

Ah, right, I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 5.535e-27. So it's 5.535e-26 J.

Looking back at the options:

Option A:5.645e-26

Option B:2.822e-26

Option C:7.056e-27

Option D:122.330.

So the computed value is approximately 5.535e-26, which is close to option A, which is 5.645e-26. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exact value.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38:

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiplying gives 8.988 *2.566 =23.0632, and exponents 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So 23.0632e-29.

Multiply by 24:23.0632 *24=553.5168.

553.5168e-29 =5.535168e-26 J.

So approximately 5.535e-26 J.

But option A is 5.645e-26, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the multiplication somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is also contributing, but that would require knowing the distances between the 12 charges.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's only possible if they are arranged in a symmetric configuration where their contributions cancel out. For example, if they are placed symmetrically around the 13th charge, but that doesn't necessarily make their mutual potential energy zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential between the 12 charges, in which case the answer would be approximately 5.535e-26 J, which is closest to option A, but perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, but the mutual interactions between the 12 are 12 choose 2, which is 66 pairs. Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r, but without knowing r, perhaps the problem is assuming that r is 2 meters as well, which would be incorrect because the 12 charges are constrained to be 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances could be different.

Wait, if the mutual potential between the 12 charges is considered, and each of the 66 pairs is at 2 meters, then the mutual potential energy would be 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

Wait, that would add 66 * (k*4e²)/(2) =66 *2 k e² =132 k e².

So the total potential energy would be 24 k e² (from the 13th and the 12) plus 132 k e² (from the mutual interactions of the 12) =156 k e².

But that would be (156)*8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute that.

k=8.988e9, e=1.602e-19.

So 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.0632e-29.

Then multiply by 156:

23.0632e-29 *156 =23.0632 *156 e-29.

23 *156=3588.

0.0632 *156≈9.862.

So 3588+9.862=3597.862.

So 3597.862e-29 =3.597862e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.598e-26 J. Not matching any options.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be as small as possible. Since each pair contributes a positive value, the minimal mutual potential energy would be when each pair is as far apart as possible, making r as large as possible.

But without knowing the exact r, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energy. Therefore, the initial calculation of 5.535e-26 J is the main contribution, which is close to option A (5.645e-26).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for k and e.

Let me try with more precise e and k.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So, e squared is (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approximately 2.566969934e-38 C².

k * e² =8.9875517879e9 *2.566969934e-38.

Compute this:

8.9875517879e9 *2.566969934e-38 = multiply the coefficients: 8.9875517879 *2.566969934.

Let me compute that.

8 *2.566969934 ≈20.53575947.

0.9875517879 *2.566969934 ≈ ?

0.98755 *2.56697 ≈

Let me compute 0.98755 *2.56697.

Approximately:

0.98755 *2 =1.9751.

0.98755 *0.5 =0.493775.

0.98755 *0.06697 ≈0.066241.

Adding: 1.9751 +0.493775 =2.468875 +0.066241=2.535116.

So total is 20.53575947 +2.535116 ≈23.0708755.

So k *e² ≈23.0708755e-29 J·m.

Now, the total potential energy from the 13th charge and the 12 others is 24 * k *e².

24 *23.0708755e-29 =553.701e-29=5.53701e-26 J.

Still, approximately 5.537e-26 J.

But the option A is 5.645e-26. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact calculation:

k *e² =8.9875517879e9 * (1.602176634e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 x (1e-19)^2 =2.56697 x 1e-38.

So 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56697e-38 = ?

Multiply 8.9875517879 *2.56697.

Let me compute it more accurately:

2.56697 *8 =20.53576.

2.56697 *0.9875517879 ≈

Wait, 0.9875517879 is approximately 0.98755.

So 2.56697 *0.98755 = let's compute:

2.56697 *0.9=2.310273.

2.56697 *0.08=0.2053576.

2.56697 *0.00755=?

Compute 2.56697 *0.007 =0.0179688.

2.56697 *0.00055=0.00141183.

Sum: 0.0179688 +0.00141183=0.0193806.

So total is 2.310273 +0.2053576=2.51563 +0.0193806=2.53501.

So total k *e² =20.53576 +2.53501 =23.07077e-29.

So 24 *23.07077e-29 =553.6986e-29 =5.536986e-26 J.

So approximately 5.537e-26 J.

Looking at the options, only option A is in the same order of magnitude. But option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 0.01 higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, but assuming that the mutual distances are 2 meters as well, which is not possible because they're all at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances would be varying.

If I include the mutual potential energy, each pair among the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) again.

Wait, but that would be (k *4e²)/(2) =2k e² per pair.

There are 66 such pairs (12 choose 2), so total mutual potential energy is 66 *2k e² =132 k e².

Adding that to the 24 k e² from the 13th charge, total U =156 k e².

Which, with k e²=23.07077e-29, gives 156 *23.07077e-29 =3597.9e-29 =3.5979e-26 J.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered, and the minimal energy is 5.537e-26 J, which is closest to option A, but the answer is not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like k=9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me compute with k=9e9.

Then, 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 24 *9e9 *2.566e-38.

24 *9=216.

9e9 *2.566e-38=23.094e-29.

216 *23.094e-29= 216 *23.094 = 5000. (Wait, 200*23=4600, 16*23=368, 4600+368=4968.

Wait,

23.094 *216 = ?

23 *200=4600.

23 *16=368.

0.094 *200=18.8.

0.094 *16=1.504.

So 4600 +368=4968 +18.8=4986.8 +1.504=4988.304.

So 4988.304e-29 =4.988304e-26 J.

Which is approximately 4.988e-26 J, but that's not matching any option either.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered, and the correct answer is approximately 5.535e-26 J, which is closest to option A (5.645e-26), but perhaps the problem expects us to consider the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges as zero, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible as they are all positive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and the mutual potential is zero, so the correct answer would be 5.535e-26 J, which doesn't match any option. But the options have B as 2.822e-26, which is about half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. The 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 contributes, so 12 terms of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is correct. But perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is at 2m from P, and the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) potential energy. So 12*(k*(4e²)/(2)) =12*(2k e²) =24k e².

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e =1.6e-19 C for simplicity.

Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19 C.

So e squared=2.56e-38.

k=8.988e9.

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38 =24 * (8.988 *2.56) e(9-38).

8.988 *2.56= approx 23.06.

So 24 *23.06e-29 =553.44e-29 =5.5344e-26 J.

Still around 5.53e-26.

But option A is 5.645e-26, which is 0.01 higher.

I think that despite the slight discrepancy, the intended answer is option A, as it's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as 24*(k*(e^2))/(2m), but that would be incorrect because each charge is 2e.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the potential energy between two charges.

Wait, the formula U = k*(q1 q2)/r.

So for each pair between the 13th charge (2e) and the 12 others (2e each), U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) =k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is the distance, which is 2m.

Ah, wait, 2e *2e is 4e², and divided by 2m.

So U_i = (k *4e²)/(2m) )= (2 k e²)/m.

Wait, but wait, no, the denominator is 2m because the distance is 2 m.

Yes, so U_i= (k *4e²)/(2*2) ?

Wait, no, wait. The distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2 m. So the denominator is 2 m.

So U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) )= (4 k e²)/(2 m) )= (2 k e²)/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2 m = 2 *1 m.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 m, which is 2 meters.

Ah! Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.

In the calculation, I have:

U_i = k*(2e)^2 / (2 m), but 2 m is 2 meters, so the denominator is 2 meters, not 2 times another variable m.

Wait, no, 2 m is the distance, which is 2 meters.

So, U_i = k*(4 e²) / (2) = 2 k e².

Wait, but the denominator is the distance, which is 2 m, so 2 meters.

So, U_i = k * (4e²) / (2) = 2 k e².

Yes, that's correct.

So, the initial calculation stands.

Hmm.

I think that the intended answer is option A, 5.645e-26. Perhaps the problem expects us to round it to three decimal places, which would make it 5.535e-26 ≈5.535 x10^-26, but the options don't have that. Wait, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 0.01 higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute 8.988e9 * (2e)^2 / (2).

Wait, but (2e)^2 is 4e², so 8.988e9 *4e² /2.

Which is 8.988e9 *4 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

=8.988e9 *4 *2.566e-38 /2.

=8.988e9 *4 *2.566e-38 *0.5.

=8.988e9 *2.566e-38 *2.

= (8.988 *2.566) *2 *1e9 *1e-38.

=23.0632 *2 *1e-29.

=46.1264e-29 =4.61264e-28.

Wait, but that's per pair, and there are 12 pairs, so 12 *4.61264e-28 =5.535168e-26 J.

Same as before.

Hmm.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but the closest option is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e as 1.6e-19 C, leading to a slightly different value.

Using e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38.

24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38=23.063e-29.

24 *23.063e-29=553.512e-29=5.53512e-26 J.

Still same as before.

In conclusion, I think the intended answer is option A:5.645e-26, but my calculation yields approximately 5.535e-26. Perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy for each pair is (k q1 q2)/r, but in an isolated system, when you bring the charges from infinity to their positions, you have to calculate the work done. Wait, but the problem states that the system is isolated, so perhaps the charges are initially at rest and we're calculating the potential energy of the system as it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all individual contributions, but I can't see any other way. Given the options, the closest is A, but perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 2 meters, making the denominator 2, and the calculation is correct, leading to 5.535e-26, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but the 13th charge is also at 2m from each of them, which isn't possible unless all are at the same point, which would make the mutual potential energy infinite. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, leading to a different mutual potential energy. But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute that.

Given all that, I think the intended answer is option A:5.645e-26 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Formula
The potential energy between two point charges is given by:

\[
U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
\]

where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant. For identical charges, \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), so:

\[
U = k \frac{(2e)^2}{r} = k \frac{4e^2}{r}
\]

### Total Potential Energy
The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy is:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U = 12 \cdot \left( k \frac{4e^2}{r} \right)
\]

Substituting \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \):

\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot \left( k \frac{4e^2}{2} \right) = 24 \cdot k \cdot e^2
\]

### Numerical Calculation
1. Compute \( e^2 \):
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]

2. Compute \( k \cdot e^2 \):
   \[
   k \cdot e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 23.0632 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{J·m}
   \]

3. Multiply by 24:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (23.0632 \times 10^{-29}) = 553.5168 \times 10^{-29} = 5.535 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated total potential energy is approximately \( 5.535 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \)**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \)**: Half the calculated value, likely incorrect.
- **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \)**: An order of magnitude smaller, incorrect.
- **D) \( 122.330 \)**: Far too large, incorrect.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated value is **A**, which is likely the intended answer despite the slight discrepancy.

Answer: A
