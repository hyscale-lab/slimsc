Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states) rather than pure. Pure states are like |psi><psi|, but this looks different.

Wait, so the given rho is a diagonal matrix with entries 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. Let me write it out in matrix form. The standard basis for qubits is |0> and |1>, so the density matrix would be a 2x2 matrix:

rho = [ [1/2, 0],
         [0, 1/2] ]

I think that makes sense. So, each diagonal element represents the probability of the state being in that basis state. Since both are 1/2, it's like a completely mixed state, right? Because it's equally likely to be in |0> or |1>.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh wait, I think in the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be represented as a vector on or inside the unit sphere. For density matrices, the Bloch vector (or sometimes called the purity vector) is a way to represent the state.

The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). So, the vector r has components (x, y, z), and it's constrained to have a magnitude ≤1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite.

Let me compute that. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me express that using the I and sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z terms.

I know that I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, substituting into rho = (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z)/2.

Given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is equal to [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ].

Wait, but the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 would be [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], which is exactly rho. So, that means the terms with sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z must all be zero. Because:

rho = (I + r·σ)/2 → our rho is (I + 0)/2. So, r must be zero vector.

So, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Bloch sphere represents pure states as points on the sphere, and mixed states as points inside. The completely mixed state would be at the origin because the Bloch vector has magnitude zero. So yes, that makes sense.

So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state, as it is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). The question asks for the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space, which can be represented using the Bloch sphere. For a single-qubit density matrix, the Bloch representation is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that the terms involving \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are zero, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented as the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
