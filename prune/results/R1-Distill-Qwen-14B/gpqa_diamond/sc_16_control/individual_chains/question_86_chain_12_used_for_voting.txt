Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about reducing agents and stereochemistry in the product. Alright, let's see.

So, the problem says that a chemist used two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, actually, looking again, it says Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 and H+ gives (R)-4-ethyl... and Reaction 2: B + BH3 and H+ gives (S)-4-ethyl... Wait, no, the setup says two reactions, each with different reducing agents. So A is treated with LiBH4, and B with BH3. Then, the products are both 4-ethyl... but with different configurations, R and S.

I think I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B must be to produce those products upon reduction. So, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones to produce secondary alcohols. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, perhaps for esters or something else? Or wait, I remember that BH3 is used in the hydroboration reaction, which typically follows anti-Markovnikov addition. But wait, in this context, maybe it's part of a different reaction.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Oh wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, like a cyclic ether with a ketone group. So, maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone that, upon reduction, forms this cyclic structure.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, LiBH4 typically reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols, but I'm a bit confused here. Wait, noâ€”LiBH4 can't directly reduce esters to alcohols. For esters, you usually need something like LiAlH4. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketals or acetals, but that's not making sense right now.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal. So perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone that upon treatment with a reducing agent forms this cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals or ketals. Let me think: when you reduce a cyclic ketone, you would get a diol, but the product here is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material isn't the ketone itself but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides? No, no, because LiBH4 isn't commonly used for opening epoxides. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are esters or lactones. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the product structure. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would be a six-membered ring, with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So, the ring is like O-C-O, but it's a tetrahydro-pyran, so it's a partially hydrogenated ring. So, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (an cyclic ester) which upon reduction gives the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions. Wait, maybe in this case, the starting materials are ketones or esters, and the reducing agents are reducing them in different ways.

Wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but maybe in this case, the ester is part of a larger ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are causing some kind of ring-opening or ring-modification.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals or ketals, and the reducing agents are breaking them. Hmm, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketals that when treated with a reducing agent, like LiBH4, open up and then form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 in acidic conditions (H+) would probably be a work-up step after the reaction. Maybe the starting materials are esters, and the LiBH4 is reducing them.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone with an ethyl group. Maybe the starting materials are esters that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone. Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think about it differently.

Another approach: the product is (R) or (S) configuration. So the starting materials must have had a specific configuration leading to that. Since LiBH4 and BH3 are different, perhaps they're affecting the reaction in a way that leads to different stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. LiBH4 can open epoxides in some cases. Wait, but more commonly, BH3 is used for epoxide ring opening in hydroboration. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are causing some ring-opening.

Wait, no, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with protecting groups. For example, maybe the starting material is an acetal or ketal of a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the reagents and what they do.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, amides, ketones, aldehydes, etc. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but in some cases, it's used as a reducing agent in different contexts. Wait, BH3 is a Lewis acid and is used in the reduction of esters to alcohols with other reagents, like in the Brown's hydroboration but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters which, upon treatment with LiBH4 or BH3, are reduced to diols. But then, the product is a cyclic ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. When you reduce a lactone, you get a diol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, not a diol. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, or perhaps a cyclic ether with a ketone. Let me draw the structure. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and ethyl at position 4. So, the ring is O-C-O, but with two CH2 groups on each side?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters of some diols. For example, if you have a diol with an ester group, upon reduction, you might lose the ester and form the diol. But that doesn't explain the formation of the cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals. When the ketal is reduced, the ring could open, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reduction is creating the ring.

Alternatively, think about the stereochemistry. The product has R and S configurations, which implies that the starting material must have been a specific configuration as well.

Wait, another approach: Let's suppose that the starting materials are esters or lactones. When you reduce a lactone, you get a diol. But how does that become a cyclic ketone? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with some protecting groups, and the reagents remove those groups to form the product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the options provided. Let's look at the options.

The options give structures for A and B. Both are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but enantiomers or same configuration.

So, the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives. Structure: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxo-pentanoic acid.

So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but this one has substituents. Let's number the pentanoic acid as 1 to 5. So, position 3 is ethyl, and position 5 has isobutoxy and oxo groups.

So, structure would be:

O
||
O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)2-O-CO-OH ?

Wait, maybe better to write the structure. Let's see.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, position 5 has an isobutoxy group and an oxo group.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, position 5 is the carboxylic acid.

Wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. The positions are numbered from the COOH end. So, COOH is position 1, then next is 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no, wait: I think the numbering starts from the COOH group as position 1, so the chain is:

1 (COOH) - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.

So, 3 is the third carbon from the COOH, 5 is the fifth, which would be the end of the chain.

Wait, but in the compound 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the 5 position has both isobutoxy and oxo groups. How is that possible? Because the 5th carbon would be CH2, but if it's substituted with isobutoxy and a ketone, that doesn't seem possible.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic structure? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the 5th position is part of a branch.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is CH2-COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-...

Wait, no, maybe the chain is longer. Let me try again.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, in pentanoic acid, the main chain is five carbons. So, the positions are:

1: COOH

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl)

4: CH2-

5: C(O-CH(CH2)2CH3) (since it's 5-isobutoxy and 5-oxo)

Wait, but position 5 is the terminal end. So, it's:

Carboxylic acid (C1), then C2, C3, C4, C5.

But C5 would be the end, so the structure would be:

C1 (COOH) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH2CH3)) - C4 (CH2) - C5 (C(O)O-CH(CH2)2CH3). Wait, but C5 would have a carbonyl group (oxo) and an isobutoxy group attached. But that would mean the C5 is a carbonyl group, which isn't possible because C5 is the terminal carbon.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Wait, maybe I should think of this as a cyclic ketone, but the question says it's a pentanoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5-oxo refers to a ketone on the 5th carbon, but how can that be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2)2CH3)

Wait, but that would make the 5th carbon (counting from COOH) have a ketone and an isobutoxy group. So, the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid at position 1, then 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH2CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (C(O-O-... )).

Wait, but 5 being a carbonyl would mean that the chain is longer, perhaps, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

The main chain is five carbons, with substituents. So, the 5th carbon is adjacent to the 4th, but where is the ketone and isobutoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is like:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but that would have a ketone on the 5th carbon, which is the end. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure where the 5th carbon is part of a ring. But wait, the options don't mention rings. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So, when you reduce a lactone, you get a diol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, not a diol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reducing agent is converting it into a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction of a cyclic ketone, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a Robinson annulation or some kind of ring-forming reaction during reduction.

Wait, I'm not making progress this way. Let me try to think about the reagents and their effects.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters to alcohols, but I'm not sure. Wait, usually, esters are reduced by LiAlH4 to form alcohols. LiBH4 might not be strong enough for esters. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, maybe the starting material is an aldehyde that undergoes a ring-forming reaction when reduced.

Wait, another possibility: The starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents are opening them. For example, LiBH4 could act as a nucleophile in an epoxide opening. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals or ketals. When treated with a reducing agent, such as LiBH4, the acetal would open, and perhaps the carbonyl would be reduced. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which, upon reduction, form cyclic hemiacetals or ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are aldehydes that, when treated with LiBH4, form secondary alcohols, but then cyclize.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options give A and B as either R or S configuration in 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the same compound but as R or S. So, perhaps, when treated with different reducing agents, the stereochemistry of the product is controlled.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a diketone or something that undergoes cyclization upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diester or a diol which, upon reduction, forms a ring.

Wait, another approach: The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. The ethyl is at position 4.

So, the ring is O-C-C-C-O-C=O? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure of pyran-2-one is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen. The ketone is at position 2, so the ring is O-C=O, but in a six-membered arrangement. So, the ring is O-C-O-C-C-C=O? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the ring is:

O
|
C=O
|
C-C-C-C

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like:

The ring is O connected to C2, which is the carbonyl.

So, positions are 1 (O), 2 (C=O), 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, the structure would be:

O
|
C=O
|
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

But that's not a ring. Wait, perhaps it's a six-membered ring with the O and C=O in positions 1 and 2, respectively.

So, the ring would be:

O at position 1, then C=O at position 2, and then four CH2 groups? No, that's five positions. Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring? No, the name is pyran, which is six-membered.

Wait, perhaps the ring is O connected to C2 (the carbonyl), then C3, C4, C5, C6, and back to O.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed.

Assuming that the product is formed by the reduction of a starting material, which is a pentanoic acid derivative. The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-(CH2)2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(O-something)-something.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CH(OCH(CH2)2CH3) - C=O

Wait, but that would make the 5th carbon a carbonyl, but then it's a pentanoic acid, so I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CH(OCH(CH2)2CH3) - CH2-O-something?

No, I'm not getting it right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction forms the pyranone.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ether with a ketone. So, the starting material might have been an acetal or ketal that, when reduced, forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, for example, suppose the starting material is a ketal: R-O-C-O-R, and upon reduction, it breaks down to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and when treated with LiBH4, it's reduced to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester. When reduced, it forms a secondary alcohol, which then can cyclize.

Wait, for example, if you have a Î²-keto ester like CH2CO-COOR, upon reduction with LiBH4, it would form CH2CH(OH)-COOR. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, it undergoes cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an Î±-hydroxy ester. Reduction could lead to formation of an alcohol which then cyclizes.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So, the reduction must be leading to a stereocenter, and the starting material's configuration would determine the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is R or S, the product would be R or S.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reducing agent opens it in a way that creates a stereocenter.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone with a specific configuration.

But I'm not making progress on the structure. Let me think about the reagents.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce esters, amides, etc., but in this case, maybe it's reducing a ketal or an acetal.

Wait, another thought: The starting material is an ester of a diol. For example, if you have a diol like HOCH2CH2CH2CH2OH, and its ester with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal. When LiBH4 is added, it breaks the ring and reduces the carbonyl to an alcohol, which could then form a new ring.

But I'm still not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that is reduced to form a diol, which then loses water to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material might have been a Î²-keto ester that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, if the starting material is a Î²-keto ester like CH2(COOR)COOR', then reduction with LiBH4 would form CH2(COOR)CH(OH)R', which then under acidic conditions could lose water and form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester, and the reduction leads to a diol, which can then form the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not certain. Let's think about the reagents again.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but it's typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, but it's usually used in hydroboration reactions, not for reducing esters or ketones. Wait, but BH3 can also be used in the presence of other reagents, like in the reduction of esters to alcohols under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reagent LiBH4 is used to reduce a carbonyl group to an alcohol, while BH3 is used in a different way, like hydroboration, to form a different stereochemistry.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde that is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a protecting group. For example, if the starting material is a methyl ketone protected as an acetal, then LiBH4 would reduce the methyl ketone to an alcohol, and the acetal would be cleaved in acidic conditions, leading to the formation of the pyranone.

But I'm not making progress. Let's think about the options again.

The options are about the configuration of the starting material. So, if A and B are different enantiomers, then the products would have different configurations depending on how the reduction proceeds.

Assuming that the starting materials are (R) and (S) configurations, the product's configuration would depend on the reducing agent's ability to induce inversion or retain configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically doesn't change stereochemistry in a carbonyl group. Wait, no, because when you reduce a carbonyl to an alcohol, the configuration depends on the starting material. For example, if you have a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl, the reduction could lead to retention or inversion.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, the starting material has a chiral center, and the reduction leads to the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an epoxide ring, and the reducing agent opens it in a specific way to form the product with a specific configuration.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine that the starting material is a diester, and when reduced, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but then the stereochemistry of the diol would determine the configuration of the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction with different agents leads to different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an Î±,Î²-epoxide, and the reduction leads to ring-opening with specific stereochemistry.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the answer options.

The options are about the starting materials being either R or S in configuration. So, for A and B, the starting materials are either the same or different enantiomers.

If A is treated with LiBH4 and gives an R product, and B is treated with BH3 and gives an S product, then the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is R, and LiBH4 reduces it, perhaps the product would have the same configuration, or opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, but in the case of reducing a carbonyl to an alcohol, the configuration isn't determined by the starting material because the carbonyl is planar. So, the product would form a new chiral center with possible retention or racemization.

Wait, no, that's not correct. If the starting material is a ketone adjacent to a chiral center, then the reduction would form an alcohol with a specific configuration based on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-keto ester with a chiral center. Reducing the ketone would form an alcohol with a new chiral center, and the configuration would depend on the starting material's configuration and the reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate reduction, leading to the formation of a new stereocenter.

Wait, if the starting material is an Î±,Î²-unsaturated ester, then a conjugate reduction (like with LiBH4) would add the hydride to the Î²-position, creating a new chiral center. The configuration of the starting material would determine the product's configuration.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent, and the reduction leads to the product with the opposite configuration.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A) A and B are both S
B) A and B are both R
C) A is S, B is R
D) A is R, B is S

We have products (R) and (S), so the starting materials must have been different enantiomers.

Wait, but in the problem, A is treated with LiBH4 to give (R), and B is treated with BH3 to give (S). So, the starting materials A and B must be different in such a way that their reduction leads to opposite configurations.

Assuming that the starting materials are enantiomers, then the reagents would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. Perhaps one leads to retention of configuration, and the other leads to inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a Î²-hydroxy ester, and the reducing agent affects the configuration during the reduction.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol. If the diol is formed from a reducing agent that affects the configuration, then the cyclic product would have the corresponding configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diester, and the reducing agent adds hydride in a specific way, leading to the diol with a specific configuration.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The only way the products would be R and S is if the starting materials were enantiomers, and the reagents influence the configuration.

So, if A is R and B is S, then treating with different reagents could lead to R and S products.

Looking at the options, option D says A is R, B is S. So, perhaps that's the correct option.

But wait, why would different reagents lead to different configurations? Because LiBH4 and BH3 might approach the starting material from different faces, leading to different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents open them with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is a Lewis acid, so perhaps they open epoxides in different ways.

Wait, if the starting material is an epoxide with a specific configuration, and the reagent opens it with different stereochemistry, then the product would have the opposite configuration.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reducing agents break different bonds.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options.

The options are about the starting materials being R or S. So, if A is R and B is S, then the products would be R and S, which matches the product configurations.

In the question, A uses LiBH4, which gives R, and B uses BH3, which gives S. So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the products to have opposite configurations.

So, option D would have A as R and B as S, which would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the configuration to invert. For example, if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would give the same configuration (R), and BH3 would give the opposite (S).

Wait, but in that case, the starting materials would be the same, which is not the case in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. When you reduce a cyclic acetal with LiBH4, you break the acetal and reduce the carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with protecting groups. For example, if the starting material is a methyl ketone protected as an acetal, then LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, and the acetal would break, leading to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the correct option.

The correct answer is D, I think. Because the starting materials must be enantiomers, and the reagents produce the corresponding R and S products.

So, the answer is D: A is R, B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one using different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3. The product is a cyclic ketone, and the stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent used.

The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which exists as enantiomers (R or S). The stereochemistry of the product is influenced by the configuration of the starting material and the reagents. LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents, and they may lead to different stereochemical outcomes depending on how they interact with the starting material.

To produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting materials must be enantiomers. If A is treated with LiBH4 to give the (R)-product and B is treated with BH3 to give the (S)-product, the starting materials must correspond to the correct enantiomers. Specifically, A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

This configuration ensures that the stereochemistry of the product matches the given (R) and (S) configurations based on the reducing agents used.

Answer: D
