Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate would be PO4^3-, right?

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Their molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

But in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. It should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, it contributes H2PO4^- to the solution.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, this contributes HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, these ions might undergo further dissociation. So, H2PO4^- can dissociate further to form HPO4^2- and H+ because Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is much smaller than Ka1. Similarly, HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+ with Ka3 being 1.8e-12, which is really small.

But I'm trying to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So, how much PO4^3- is present?

Hmm, maybe this is a buffer solution situation. Because we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, which are consecutive species in the dissociation of H3PO4. So the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would be determined by the amounts of these salts, and the pH is determined by the ratio of these concentrations and the Ka2 value.

Oh, right! Because the buffer is between the second and third dissociations, but wait, no. Wait, H2PO4^- is from the first dissociation (H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^-), and HPO4^2- is from the second (H2PO4^- losing a proton). So the buffer here is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would relate to Ka2.

So, according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Wait, but since I'm looking for PO4^3-, which is from the third dissociation, I need to consider the third equilibrium. But the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation constant, Ka3.

But wait, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the buffer is around the second dissociation, and the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because Ka3 is so small.

So maybe I can calculate the pH first using the buffer equation, then use that pH to find [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the phosphate species in solution. Let's think about the species present.

In solution, the phosphate species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But given the presence of the salts, which of these dominates?

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So each mole of KH2PO4 adds one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. Each mole of this salt adds one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts of these salts.

I think the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH will be determined by the ratio of their concentrations and the Ka2.

Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass/Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

So, the solution has 0.00734 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.00561 moles of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 ≈ 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02805 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2):

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since 10^-7.21 ≈ 6.2e-8).

So pH = 7.21 + log(0.02805 / 0.0367) 

Let me compute the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765.

log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.

So the pH is approximately 7.1.

Now, with this pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So the third dissociation is HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3-.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be calculated from pH: pH = 7.1 → [H+] = 1e-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M (from earlier) but wait, no. Wait, because the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution is about 0.028 M, but the third dissociation would consume some of that. However, since Ka3 is very small, the change would be negligible. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] as 0.02805 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (7.94e-8).

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ (5.049e-14) / (7.94e-8) ≈ 6.358e-7 M.

Wait, but that's about 6.36e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made an error in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.1) ≈ 7.94e-8 M. Correct.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (7.94e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049, so 0.05049e-12 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 7.94e-8: 5.049e-14 /7.94e-8 = (5.049 / 7.94) ) * 1e-6.

5.049 /7.94 ≈ approx 0.6358.

So 0.6358e-6 =6.358e-7 M.

So the concentration is approximately 6.36e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 5.049e-14 divided by 7.94e-8.

5.049 /7.94 is approximately 0.6358, as before. So 0.6358e-6 is 6.358e-7 M.

But the options don't have exactly this value. Option A is 6.24e-7, D is 3.97e-7, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles. Let me recalculate the moles of each salt.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. 1g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.0073438 moles.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.0073438 / 0.2 = 0.036719 M for H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1g /177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Concentration: 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M for HPO4^2-.

Wait, another thought: when Na2HPO4 is dissolved, it's HPO4^2- and Na+.

But when calculating the ratio, perhaps the initial concentrations after dissolving the salts are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M. So their ratio is 0.02805/0.0367 ≈ 0.765.

Taking the log of 0.765: log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) → pKa2 is 7.207 (since pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8 → log(6.2)=0.792, so pKa2=7.207? Wait, wait, let me compute pKa2 accurately.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Compute log(6.2e-8): log(6.2) is about 0.7924, log(1e-8) is -8 → so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.765).

log(0.765) is approximately -0.1146. So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1146 = 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 7.97e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more precisely. Let me compute 10^(-7.093):

-7.093 = -7 - 0.093.

10^-7 is 1e-7 = 1e-7.

10^-0.093 ≈ 0.859 (since 10^0.09 ≈ 1.229, wait no, 10^0.09 ≈ 1.229? Wait, no, wait. Let me think about it. Wait, 10^0.09 is approximately 1.229? Or is that wrong. Wait, 10^0.1 is about 1.258. So 0.09 would be a bit less than 0.1, so maybe around 1.229? Alternatively, using logarithm tables or a calculator approach.

But maybe it's easier to use an approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use exact calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3-] again with more precise values.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

[H+] is 7.97e-8 M.

So:

(1.8e-12) * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 7.97e-8:

5.049e-14 /7.97e-8 = (5.049 /7.97) ) * 1e-6.

5.049 /7.97 ≈ 0.633.

So 0.633e-6 → 6.33e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.33e-7. But the options don't have this. The closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places for the moles and do more precise calculations.

Let me compute the moles again.

KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 → let me compute 136.09 * 7 = 952.63 → 7e-3 is 0.007, but 136.09 * 0.0073438=1.00 g.

Wait, 136.09 × 0.0073438 = (approx) 136.09 *0.007 = 0.95263; 0.0003438 *136.09 ≈ 0.0468 → total approx 0.9994 g, so 0.0073438 mol is correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol = 1/177.99 ≈ 0.0056108 mol.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.0073438 /0.2 = 0.036719 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056108 /0.2 = 0.028054 M.

So ratio is 0.028054 / 0.036719 ≈ 0.765.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately: 0.028054 divided by 0.036719.

0.028054 / 0.036719 ≈ 0.765.

Wait, 28054/36719 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765)=?

Using a calculator, log(0.765) is approximately -0.1145.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1145 = 7.0931.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0931) ≈ ?

Let me compute 10^(-7.0931) = 10^( -7 ) * 10^(-0.0931).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.0931)= 0.8583 (since 10^(-0.09)= approx 0.8513; but exact value can be approximated with more precise method. Let me compute 0.0931 in log.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach.

But perhaps another approach: since pH=7.0931, [H+]=10^(-7.0931)=10^(-7 -0.0931)= 1e-7 *10^(-0.0931).

What's 10^(-0.0931)?

Using logarithm tables or approximation: 10^0.0931 is approximately 1.237 (since 10^0.1 ≈1.258, and 0.0931 is a bit less than 0.1). Wait, 0.0931 in log terms would be 10^0.0931= about 1.237 → so 10^(-0.0931) is 1/1.237 ≈ 0.808.

So [H+] ≈1e-7 *0.808= 8.08e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I estimated it as 7.97e-8, which is close to 8e-8.

So [H+] is approximately 8.08e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] 

Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]=0.028054 M, [H+]=8.08e-8.

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028054) / 8.08e-8 → numerator=5.05e-14. 

5.05e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.05/8.08) * 1e-6.

5.05 /8.08 ≈ 0.625.

So 0.625e-6 →6.25e-7 M.

Ah, that's about 6.25e-7, which is very close to option A) 6.24e-7 M.

So perhaps the answer is option A.

But wait, another thought: when KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are mixed, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which affects the pH. But when we calculate the concentration of PO4^3-, are we considering only the third dissociation, and does that take into account the buffer solution?

Wait, PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation constant, which is much smaller than the second. So, the PO4^3- concentration should be very low.

Wait, but in this case, the PO4^3- is formed from HPO4^2- in solution, which is 0.028 M. But because the pH is around 7.1, which is near the pKa2 (7.207), the HPO4^2- is in a buffer condition, so the actual concentration after considering the dissociation may not be exactly 0.028 M, but perhaps I can approximate it as such since the third dissociation is so small.

Alternatively, perhaps the buffer solution allows me to compute the [H+] accurately, and then use that to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total concentration of phosphate species in solution is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But since the solution is made by adding KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, the initial concentrations are dominated by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the others are negligible.

So, considering that, the [PO4^3-] is determined by the third dissociation, which is negligible compared to the other species. So, our initial calculation should be correct.

So, the concentration is approximately 6.25e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. Therefore, the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and apply the equilibrium constants for the dissociation of H₃PO₄. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- For KH₂PO₄:
  \[
  \text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
  This contributes 0.00734 moles of H₂PO₄⁻.

- For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:
  \[
  \text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
  This contributes 0.00561 moles of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations
The total volume of the solution is 0.2 L, so:
- \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸. The pH is calculated using:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right).
\]
- \[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207.
\]
- \[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \approx 0.765.
\]
- \[
\log(0.765) \approx -0.115.
\]
- \[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
- \[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]
- Substituting values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
- Numerator:
\[
1.8 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.02805 \approx 5.05 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
- Denominator:
\[
8.08 \times 10^{-8}.
\]
- \[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
