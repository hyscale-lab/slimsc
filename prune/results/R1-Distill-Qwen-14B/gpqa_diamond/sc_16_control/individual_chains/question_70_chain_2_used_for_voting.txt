Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember these are related to molecular shapes and their point groups.

First, let's break down the reactions step by step. 

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, probably a synthesis reaction. Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen or something like that. Let me think about what forms a bright red product. Oh, maybe like copper reacting with sulfur or something. But wait, more likely, I'm thinking of a metal oxide or sulfide? Or perhaps A is an element combining with B, like sulfur and something else.

Wait, let's move to the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So E is dangerous. What are some dangerous compounds that form from such reactions? Maybe something like a gas with high toxicity, like phosgene? Or perhaps a strong acid, but E is a product of C and D. 

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A and two acids. Hmm. If C is something like a sulfide, maybe, but when it reacts with water, it could produce S and some acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Wait, if C is metal chloride, reacting with water could form metal hydroxide and HCl. But that would only produce one acid. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction of C with water gives two different acids. So F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like CH3COOH, H3PO4. So if C is, say, a sulfite or something else that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal nitrate? No, because when nitrates react with water, they usually just stay as nitrates. Alternatively, C could be a metal carbonate, but reacting with water might not produce two acids. Or perhaps C is a metal sulfate? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about the reactions again. The first reaction: A + 8 B → C. So maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is copper and B is sulfur (but sulfur is a solid, not a gas). Alternatively, B could be chlorine gas. So for instance, if A is copper and B is Cl2, 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Cu. Wait, but copper typically forms CuCl2, which would require two Cl per Cu. 8 equivalents would be 4 Cl per Cu atom? That seems unlikely. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, maybe A is sodium and B is chlorine. 8 equivalents would be 8 Cl per Na? That would make NaCl2? No, that doesn't make sense since sodium is +1, so it would pair with one Cl. Hmm, maybe the formula is Na2Cl4 or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum and B is chlorine. Aluminum typically has a +3 charge, so 3 Cl per Al. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 Cl, so AlCl8? I don't think that's a common compound. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, let's think about the product C. It's bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide is red, but that's a solid. Or perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, but sulfides are usually black or yellow. Oh, wait, could C be sodium chromate or something? No, chromate is orange. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with water gives back A and two acids. So if C is a salt of two different acid anions. For example, if C is a sulfite or something. Or maybe it's a nitrite or another compound that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For instance, if A is a metal like iron, and B is sulfur. Then, FeS reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But FeS is a black solid, not bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. But carbonate reacting with water would just give the metal hydroxide and CO2 (which is a gas, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the first reaction. Maybe I should think about the second reaction. C + 2 D → E. And E is extremely hazardous. So what could E be? Maybe something like hydrogen chloride gas? No, but D is a gas. Hmm. If D is another gas, perhaps a halogen or something else. Wait, but D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B make a solvent.

Wait, H is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, DCM, etc. But D and B are gases. When they react 1:1, what do they form? Let's think: if B is Cl2 and D is H2O (but water is a liquid, not gas). Wait, but D is a gas. Hmm. Wait, D is a gas, so if B is another gas, maybe D is a different gas like O2 or something else. Or perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else.

Wait, if D and B react 1:1 to form a solvent, perhaps D is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something else.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's consider possible products E that are extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (COCl2), but how is that formed? Or perhaps, E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2O or another compound. Alternatively, maybe E is HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in itself, though it's corrosive.

Wait, another thought: if E is something like hydrogen cyanide, but I don't think that's formed from these reactions.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a metal chloride. Let's suppose A is aluminum, B is Cl2. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles per mole of Al. Aluminum has a +3 charge, so AlCl3 is the usual product. But 8 Cl would be more than that. Hmm, maybe it's a polyatomic ion.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is more like the formation of a transition metal compound. Let's think about copper. Copper can form CuCl2, but that would require 2 Cl per Cu. If 8 Cl are present, that's CuCl8^4- or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium. So sodium reacting with 8 equivalents of Cl2. Sodium is +1, so 8 Cl would make NaCl8? Which I don't think exists. Wait, that seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the initial reaction isn't a metal with a halogen. Maybe it's something else. Let's think about the possibility that A is a metal oxide and B is carbon. But carbon is solid, not gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: A could be a metal sulfide, but B is sulfur vapor. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is another element in a gaseous state.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to think about the possible structures of E. The question is about its molecular symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

The symmetry groups are point groups. D4h is a high symmetry group, like the square planar or octahedral. D∞h is for linear molecules like CO2 or H2O (but CO2 is linear), but wait, D∞h has an infinite symmetry along the axis, which applies to linear molecules. Wait, no: D∞h is the point group for linear molecules with a center of inversion and other symmetry elements. Alternatively, C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

Wait, if E is a gas and extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a molecule like phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2. Let me think: phosgene has a central carbon with two double-bonded oxygens? Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So the structure is a carbon atom with two Cl atoms and one O atom? No, wait, phosgene is (Cl)2C=O. So the structure is O=C(Cl)2. So the molecule has a trigonal planar structure? No, actually, phosgene is a planar molecule with a C=O double bond and two Cl atoms. So what's the point group?

Phosgene has a trigonal planar structure. Wait, no, the molecule is planar with the structure O=C(Cl)2. So the central C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So it's trigonal planar. The point group for a trigonal planar molecule with no additional symmetry elements (like no mirror planes or centers) would be D3h. Wait, but D3h has a principal axis of order 3 and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but in phosgene, the structure is symmetric with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane, I think. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the point group is D∞h? No, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let me think about the molecular geometry of phosgene. It's a planar molecule with a central C, double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. So the molecule is trigonal planar, with the central C being the center. The molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (since each Cl is opposite the O in a way, but actually, the two Cl atoms are in the same plane as the O and C. Wait, no, the structure is O=C(Cl)2, so O is opposite one Cl, and the other Cl is opposite the position where? Hmm, perhaps it's not exactly linear. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is linear with two Cl and one O, but that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I should look at the structure again. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So the structure is a carbon in the center, with a double bond to oxygen and two single bonds to Cl. So the molecule is trigonal planar with the central C. The molecule has a C2 axis: if you rotate 180 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Because swapping the two Cl atoms would leave the structure unchanged. So yes, a C2 axis exists. Also, there are mirror planes that include the C2 axis and each Cl-O bond. So the point group would be D3h?

Wait, but D3h has a principal C3 axis, which isn't present here. So maybe the point group is D∞h? No, because D∞h is for linear molecules. Phosgene is trigonal planar, so it's D3h? Or perhaps it's C2v.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let me think about other possibilities. If E is something like SO2, which is a bent molecule. The point group for SO2 is D2h. Or maybe it's something like O3, which has a C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: if E is CO2, which is linear. CO2 has a D∞h symmetry. Because it's linear, has a center of inversion, and has multiple mirror planes. But wait, CO2 is a linear molecule with a central carbon. Its point group is D∞h.

Wait, but in the reaction, C reacts with D to form E. If E is CO2, then D would be something that, when reacting with C, gives CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the possible reactions.

Let me make a table of possible compounds.

Assume:

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red product)

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G is weak acid)

Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

So, let's see. Maybe D is a gas that reacts with B to form a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is H2O (but H2O is a liquid), so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else.

Wait, maybe B is CO2 and D is another gas. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2S. No, that's a gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: H is a solvent formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Solvents that are formed from gases reacting 1:1... perhaps H is water? But then B and D would be H2 and O2, which react in a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Or maybe D is H2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 (a gas) and D is HCl (a gas). They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O. But H2O is a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is a halogen vapor, like Cl2. D is another gas, perhaps H2O. But again, H2O is liquid. Hmm. Maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2. They react in a 1:1 ratio... but H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S and D is O2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form something. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So, C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH and H2SO3 (which decomposes into H2O and SO2 + H2O?), but that might not produce two acids.

Alternatively, if C is a nitrate, but nitrates usually hydrolyze to give nitric acid, but only one acid.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal carbonate. Wait, metal carbonates usually hydrolyze to give metal hydroxides and CO2. That's only one acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, but sulfate salts usually don't hydrolyze to produce acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a phosphate. No, not likely to produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, suppose C is FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it can produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is not an acid. Hmm, perhaps the hydrolysis produces A, which is Fe, F which is H2SO4 (strong acid), and G which is H2S (weak acid). So in this scenario, C is FeS.

But FeS is a black solid, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is PbS (which is bright yellow, but sometimes can look red?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide like CuS. CuS is black, but maybe in some forms it's red. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps C is a nitrosyl compound.

Wait, another angle: if C reacts with D to form E, which is a dangerous gas. For example, if C is a chloride and D is something like SO2, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine gas? No, because D is a gas, so B and D react to form H (a solvent). Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2). Phosgene is a highly toxic gas. So how would that form? If C is a chloride and D is CO, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O, but that's not as common.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If C is a chloride salt, and D is a gas, perhaps CO or something else. Alternatively, if C is a metal chloride and D is a gas like CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is something like ClO2, which is a toxic gas. But how would that form?

Alternatively, maybe E is HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous on its own, though it's highly toxic in high concentrations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A is sodium. Let's say Reaction 1 is 2 Na + 8 Cl2 → 8 NaCl + something? No, that doesn't balance.

Wait, sodium has a +1 charge. So 8 Cl would imply 8 Cl per Na. So formula would be NaCl8? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is Cl2. 8 Cl per Fe. So FeCl8^4−? I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't between a metal and a halogen. Maybe A is a non-metal.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur and B is something else. But sulfur is a solid, so it's reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is carbon. Then, reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B. If B is O2, then reaction would be 8 O2 + C → CO? No, that's not a solid.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction produces something like CO2 or CO, but those are gases, not solids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about what E's molecular symmetry could be, and see if that gives me a clue.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h is a high symmetry group with a four-fold rotation, mirror planes, etc. D∞h is for linear molecules like CO2 or HCN. C2v has a two-fold rotation and vertical mirror plane(s).

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. So possible candidates are CO2, HCN, NO2 (but NO2 is bent, so D2h), etc.

If E has D4h symmetry, possible structures include square planar or octahedral. But D4h is more about molecules with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes. For example, something like SO4^2- has Td symmetry, not D4h.

Wait, maybe E is a molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry. O2 is a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion, so yes, D∞h. But is O2 extremely hazardous? Well, it's a major component of air, but in high concentrations, it can be dangerous. Not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, E could be something like Cl2O, but I'm not certain about its symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: if E is SO2, which is a bent molecule. The point group for SO2 is D2h. That doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), its point group is C2v. Because ozone is a bent molecule with a central O, it has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane, and a mirror plane bisecting the angle. So the point group would be C2v, which is option D.

Wait, O3 has a structure where the central O is connected to two O atoms on either side. The molecule is bent, with a bond angle of about 117 degrees. Its point group is D3h? Or C2v?

Hmm, I think ozone has a C2v symmetry. Because the molecule has a C2 axis (perpendicular to the plane, going through the central O), and a mirror plane that includes the C2 axis and bisects the angle between the two O atoms. That would make the point group C2v.

So, if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v. But is O3 a possible product in the reaction?

Let's see the reactions again. C reacts with D to form E. If E is O3, then perhaps D is O2 and C is some compound that can produce O3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is another molecule with C2v symmetry, like H2O2. Wait, H2O2 has a C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis through the O atoms and a mirror plane.

Wait, but H2O2 is a liquid, not a gas. So if E is a gas, maybe O3 is a possibility since it's a gas.

So, if E is O3, then what is C and D?

C would be a compound that reacts with D (a gas) to form O3.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2. But earlier I was confused about its point group.

Wait, let me think about phosgene's structure. It's a trigonal planar molecule with a central carbon, double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is symmetric along the C-Cl axis. Wait, but that's a C2 axis. So the molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane, and two mirror planes that include this C2 axis and each Cl atom. So that would make the point group D3h?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the point group for phosgene. Alternatively, maybe it's C2v.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look up the point group of phosgene, but I can't do that right now, so I have to think.

Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. The molecule has a trigonal planar geometry. The central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms.

The point group is determined by the symmetry elements present. The molecule has a C2 axis: if you rotate 180 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the plane (through the C), the molecule looks the same because the two Cl atoms swap places. So a C2 axis is present.

It also has two mirror planes that include the C2 axis and each Cl-O bond. So these are vertical mirror planes.

But with these, the point group is D3h? Or C2v?

Wait, no, D3h requires a principal C3 axis, which this molecule doesn't have. So the correct point group would be C2v. Because there's a C2 axis, and two vertical mirror planes (each containing the C2 axis and a Cl atom). So yes, C2v.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's D∞h or another group.

Wait, another angle: the options include D4h, which is a high symmetry group. If E were something like CCl4, which has a tetrahedral structure, its point group is Td. But that's not in the options.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like CH4, which has Td symmetry. But that's a gas, but I don't know if it's extremely hazardous.

Wait, back to the reactions. The third reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a sulfite, which upon hydrolysis gives sulfurous acid (weak) and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But that's not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. Not acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not an acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid. But Fe(OH)2 is not an acid; perhaps it's part of A. Wait, but A is a solid. So when C is FeS, and it reacts with water, it produces Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But Fe(OH)2 isn't an acid. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. But nitrates typically produce HNO3 when hydrolyzed.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfate. For example, CuSO4. When it reacts with water, it just remains as CuSO4·5H2O. Doesn't produce any acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this. Let's think about the first reaction again. Solid A plus 8 B (gas) gives bright red product C. If C is a bright red solid, perhaps it's copper(II) oxide, but that's black. Or perhaps it's a sulfide. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is black, but some chromium compounds are colored, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of gas B. If B is a diatomic molecule, like O2, then 8 moles per mole of A would mean a high oxidation state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S. No, that's a gas. But in that case, 8 equivalents would imply a lot of sulfide ions.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to make some assumptions.

Assume that E has D∞h symmetry. That would make it a linear molecule. What linear, extremely hazardous gas has D∞h symmetry? Ozone (O3) has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. If E were CO2, then let's see.

CO2 is a product of what reaction? C + D → CO2.

If D is O2, then C would have to be something that reacts with O2 to form CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which would have C2v symmetry as discussed earlier.

But the options include C2v as option D.

Wait, another approach: the point group of E is one of the options. If E has D∞h symmetry, like CO2, then the correct option would be B) D4h? No, wait, CO2 has D∞h symmetry. So option C is D∞h.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

So if E is CO2, option C is correct. If E is O3, option D is correct.

But what's E in the reaction? Let's see.

If E is CO2, then C + 2 D → CO2. What could D be?

If D is O2, then C would be something that reacts with O2 to form CO2. Maybe C is carbon monoxide, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, which upon reaction with O2 would decompose, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas. Let me try to think of another possibility.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Suppose C is CaCO3. Then, reacting with HCl (but HCl is a gas?) No, HCl is a gas but in the reaction with CaCO3, it would produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. But that doesn't fit the equation for E.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, and D is H2O. But no, H2O is a liquid.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the reactions again.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

So, C must be a salt of two different anions, which upon hydrolysis give two acids. For example, if C is NH4HSO3 (ammonium hydrogen sulfate), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfonate ester. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bisulfide. For example, CuHS. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about sodium sulfide (Na2S). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form NaOH and H2S. So F could be NaOH (strong base) and G H2S (weak acid). But in this case, the reaction produces a base and an acid, but F is a strong acid. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that releases two different acid anions.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ , HSO4^- (which can further hydrolyze into H+ and SO4^2-). But that would only produce one acid, H2SO4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate in the same compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces both a strong and a weak acid.

For example, suppose C is NH4HSO3. When it reacts with water, it could produce NH4OH (but that's weak) and H2SO3 (which is weak). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like Ca(HSO4)2. When it reacts with water, it could produce Ca(OH)2 and H2SO4. But that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, AlCl3. When AlCl3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce Al(OH)3 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid, which fits F. But what's G? Al(OH)3 isn't an acid. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but if C is a higher chlorides, like BeCl2, which reacts with water to form Be(OH)2 and HCl. Again, only one acid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid. But again, only one acid, not two.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, NaHSO3. When it reacts with water, it could dissociate into Na+ , HSO3^- → H+ and SO3^2-? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrite. NaNO2. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into NaOH and HNO2. HNO2 is a weak acid. But again, only one acid.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I should try to think about E's structure again.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it would be a linear molecule. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. If E is CO2, then perhaps the reaction is C + 2 D → CO2.

What could D be? Let's say D is a gas that when reacts with C produces CO2.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and C is CO. Then, 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. So C is CO, D is O2, and E is CO2.

But does that fit into the earlier reactions?

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (CO).

So A would be a solid, B would be a gas that reacts with A to form CO.

But CO is a gas, but the problem says C is a solid? Wait, the first reaction says solid A reacts with gas B to form bright red product C. So C is a solid.

Wait, that's a problem. Because in my earlier assumption, C is CO, which is a gas. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

In the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form solid C (bright red). So C is a solid.

If E is a solid, that contradicts the idea that E is a gas. Wait, the second reaction says C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E. So E could be a gas.

Wait, but in the first reaction, C is a solid. So E is a gas.

So, if E is CO2, a gas, and C is a solid, what is C?

Wait, maybe C is CaCO3. Then, reaction with D (something) would produce CO2. But how?

If D is HCl (a gas), then CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. But that's a possible reaction. So in this case, C is CaCO3, D is HCl, E is CO2.

But then, looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

CaCO3 + H2O → A + F + G.

But CaCO3 is only slightly soluble in water. Maybe in the presence of acid, but in pure water, it doesn't hydrolyze much. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, if C is a metal carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS. Then, reaction with D (H2O) would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. So F would be H2S (weak acid) and G would be... wait, but Fe(OH)2 isn't an acid. So maybe this isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to think about E's symmetry again, and see which option is more plausible.

If E has D∞h symmetry (option C), then it's a linear molecule like CO2 or HCN. If E is CO2, which is a gas, and is produced by C + 2 D.

So, C + 2 D → CO2.

Let's say D is a gas, maybe O2. Then, C would be CO, which is a gas, but earlier I thought C is a solid. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas, like CH4. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. When it reacts with a strong acid (D), it produces CO2. So if C is Na2CO3, D is HCl (gas?), but HCl is a gas. So Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O. E is CO2, which is a gas and extremely hazardous in high concentrations.

But in that case, C is Na2CO3, a solid. Reaction 3: C (Na2CO3) + H2O → A + F + G.

But Na2CO3 is not very soluble in water. It would hydrolyze slightly to form NaHCO3, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different carbonate.

Wait, if C is KNO3, but that doesn't react with H2O to produce two acids.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the reaction where D and B form H, a solvent.

If B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is H2. They react to form H2O, which is a solvent.

Wait, yes! If B is O2 and D is H2, then they react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. But the problem states that B and D react in a 1:1 ratio. So that wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 (a gas) and D is HCl (a gas). They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. But that's not a solvent.

Alternatively, B is H2S and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio: H2S + Cl2 → 2 HCl + S. But that produces a solid (S) and a gas (HCl). Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps B is NO2 and D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a halogen and D is another gas.

Wait, another approach: H is a solvent formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Possible solvents formed from gases reacting 1:1... perhaps H is H2O? But H2O is formed from H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, H is NH3, but that's a gas. Or H is alcohol, but that would require B and D to be something else.

Wait, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that wouldn't form a solvent. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like methanol, but I don't see how that would form from B and D.

Wait, perhaps B is CO and D is H2. Then, in the presence of a catalyst, they can form CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. The reaction would be CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O. But as I thought earlier, H2O is a liquid, and Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So H would be HCl and HOCl? But those are not solvents.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have.

Based on the reactions, E is a gas formed from C and D. If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely CO2. But that would require C to be a solid that reacts with D (possibly O2) to form CO2. Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which has C2v symmetry, then option D would be correct.

But I'm not sure about the reactions leading to that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is a gas and extremely hazardous. How would that form?

HCN can be produced by the reaction of CH3CN with H2O (hydrolysis), but that's not fitting with the given reactions.

Wait, let me think again. Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1). If H is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O? Then B and D would have to react to form H2O in a 1:1 ratio.

But how? Let's see: if B is H2O and D is another gas, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, but they react in a 2:1 ratio.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that's not a reaction that produces a solvent.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and make an educated guess.

Given the options, and considering that CO2 has D∞h symmetry, which is one of the options (option C), then perhaps E is CO2, making the answer C) D∞h.

But earlier I thought CO2 is a possible candidate. However, without being certain about the reactions, I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D) C2v.

But how would phosgene form? If C is, say, POCl3 and D is CO, then perhaps POCl3 + CO → ... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorosulfonic ester or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) C2v because ozone has that symmetry and is a dangerous gas. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then B and D must be H2O and another gas that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if H is something like ethanol, which can be produced from B and D. For example, if B is ethylene and D is water, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is another gas. But I'm not getting anywhere.

In the interest of time, I'll go with the assumption that E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, so the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a synthesis reaction, possibly involving a metal and a halogen, but the exact identity of A, B, and C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous gas. The identity of E is critical to determining its molecular symmetry group. Potential candidates for E include CO2, phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), or O3, which are known to have specific symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This implies that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form two acids. However, the exact nature of C remains uncertain.

4. **Reaction 4**: B reacts with D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This provides a clue about the possible identity of B and D, but the exact nature of H is not fully resolved.

### Key Analysis of E's Molecular Symmetry:
- **Option A (C2)**: A C2 symmetry group involves a single two-fold rotation axis. This is unlikely for a gas like CO2 or phosgene, which have higher symmetry.
- **Option B (D4h)**: D4h symmetry involves a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes. This is characteristic of square planar or octahedral molecules, which do not match the likely candidates for E.
- **Option C (D∞h)**: D∞h symmetry applies to linear molecules like CO2, which has a principal axis of infinite order (C∞) and a horizontal mirror plane. CO2 is a plausible candidate for E, given its formation in some reactions and its linear structure.
- **Option D (C2v)**: C2v symmetry involves a two-fold rotation axis and vertical mirror planes. This is consistent with O3 (ozone), a bent molecule. However, O3 is less likely as a product in the given reactions compared to CO2.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, CO2 is the most plausible candidate for E, as it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry and aligns with the description of an extremely hazardous gas. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.
