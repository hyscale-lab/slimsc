Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when the planet tugs the star, it makes the star move towards and away from us, which shifts the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a Neptune-like planet. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the shift in spectral lines is given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's mass and the size of the orbit. But how does the shift relate to the orbital period?

I recall that the Doppler shift (sometimes called the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity) is given by a formula. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) / c ), but wait, maybe I should think of a simpler version since the problem gives the shifts and asks about the periods.

Alternatively, I remember the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * ( (4π²) / (G (M_* + M_p)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) * sin i / (c) ) * (a (1 + M_p/M_* )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think about the relation between K and the orbital period.

Another approach: the Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity, which is K. The star's velocity is due to the planet's orbit. So the formula for the velocity of the star (v) is given by:

v = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) * (a (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * ( sin i ) / ( (4π²)^(1/3) * c )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think of the simplified version. Since the masses of the planets are similar to Neptune, and the stars are like the Sun, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, the formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (4π²)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/c)

But wait, maybe I should focus on the relation between K and the orbital period P.

I think the Doppler shift is inversely proportional to the orbital period. No, wait, perhaps the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the period, but I'm not sure. Let me think about Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_*) / (4π²). So, a^3 = G M_* P² / (4 π²).

The star's velocity in the orbit is v = (2π a) / P. Because both the planet and star orbit the center of mass, but since the star's mass is much larger, the star's velocity is roughly (2π a) / P.

But a comes from Kepler's law: a^3 = G M_* P² / (4 π²), so a = [ (G M_* P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3). Plugging into v:

v = (2 π / P) * [ (G M_* P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression. Let's compute:

= (2 π) / P * [ (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Take the exponents:

= (2 π) / P * (G M_*)^(1/3) (P^2)^(1/3) (4 π²)^(-1/3) )

= (2 π) / P * (G M_*)^(1/3) P^(2/3) (4 π²)^(-1/3) )

Combine terms with P:

1/P * P^(2/3) = P^(-1/3)

So,

v = (2 π) (G M_*)^(1/3) (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Let me compute the constants:

2 π / (4 π²)^(1/3) = 2 π / ( (2^2 π²)^(1/3) ) )

= 2 π / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3) )

= [ 2^(1 - 2/3) ) ] * [ π^(1 - 2/3) ) ]

= 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)

So,

v = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) * (G M_*)^(1/3) / P^(1/3)

Which can be written as:

v = [ (2 π G M_* ) ]^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Wait, but what is v here? It's the velocity of the star, K, the semi-amplitude. So, K = v = [ (2 π G M_*) / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me redo the velocity expression.

Wait, v = (2 π a) / P. And a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, but since M_* >> M_p, a ≈ a_p * (M_p / M_*), where a_p is the planet's orbital radius. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the star's velocity: v = (M_p / M_*) * (v_p), where v_p is the planet's velocity. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the Doppler shift (K) in terms of the orbital period. Let's think of K being inversely proportional to the period, but maybe I need a more precise relation.

Wait, I think the key is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), because the velocity depends on the size of the orbit. But from Kepler's third law, a^3 ∝ P^2 M_*, so a ∝ (M_* P^2)^(1/3). So,

K ∝ (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt( a )) )

But a is ( (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 π²) )^(1/3 )

So,

sqrt(a) = [ (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/6 )

So,

1/sqrt(a) = [4 π²/( G M_* P^2 ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting this into K:

K ∝ (M_p / M_*) ) * [ (4 π² ) / ( G M_* P^2 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

But since M_p is the same for both planets (they're both Neptune-like), and M_* is the same for both stars (same mass as Sun), the ratio K1/K2 can be expressed as:

K1/K2 = [ (4 π²/( G M_* P1² ))^(1/6 ) * (M_p) / M_* ) ] / [ (4 π²/( G M_* P2² ))^(1/6 ) * (M_p) / M_* ) ]

Wait, but M_p and M_* are the same for both, so they cancel out.

So,

K1/K2 = [ (4 π²/( G M_* P1² )) / (4 π²/( G M_* P2² )) ) ]^(1/6 )

Simplifying the fraction inside:

= [ ( P2² / P1² ) ]^(1/6 )

Which is ( (P2 / P1 )^2 )^(1/6 ) ) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Hmm, but wait the question says K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7. So K1 < K2, which implies that ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 ) = K1/K2 = 5/7.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, no, wait because according to the equation, K1/K2 is (P2/P1)^(1/3). So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Let me plug in the values:

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides,

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (125 / 343 )

Then,

P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the period of #2 is shorter than #1. Wait, but the question asks, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? That would be P2 / P1 = 0.364, which is less than one. So the period of #2 is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my reasoning. Because I'm a bit confused about whether K is inversely proportional to the period or not.

Wait, K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity. From the earlier derivation, K ∝ (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a)). And from Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ P^2. So a ∝ P^(2/3). So 1/sqrt(a) is a^(-1/2) = (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) ) = P^(-1/3).

So, K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, K2 > K1 implies that P2 < P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K means shorter period.

So, K2/K1 = 7/5. Since K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because K ∝ P^(-1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So,

7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides,

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2

=> P1 = P2 * (343/125 )

So,

P2 = P1 * (125/343 )

So,

P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. It's 0.36 times longer, which is shorter, but the ratio is 0.36.

So the answer is option A, approximately 0.36.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), as derived from Kepler's third law and the relationship between orbital velocity and period. This implies:

\[
K \propto P^{-1/3}.
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2 \) and \( P_1 \) is related to the ratio of \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \), we solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
