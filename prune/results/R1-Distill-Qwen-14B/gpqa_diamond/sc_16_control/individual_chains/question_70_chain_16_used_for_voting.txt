Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. 

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and point group theory, which is used in chemistry to classify molecules based on their symmetry.

Let's start by trying to figure out the chemical reactions and identify the compounds involved. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I remember that when a solid reacts with a gas in a high molar ratio, it might be something like the formation of a transition metal compound. Bright red makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but wait, no, iron(III) oxide is black. Or maybe something with sulfur? Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate formation.

Wait, another thought: when certain metals react with oxygen, they form oxides. For example, copper forms CuO, which is black, not red. Aluminum oxide is white. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur, like forming SO3? Or perhaps a transition metal like chromium? Oh wait, I think I remember something about lead(IV) oxide, PbO2, which is dark brown—maybe not bright red. Alternatively, could it be something else?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about a metal reacting with chlorine? Because chlorine is a gas. Let me think: if solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (which is probably Cl2), maybe it's a metal that forms a high oxidation state. For example, if A is iron metal (Fe), reacting with Cl2, but iron usually forms FeCl3 in such reactions. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Let's see: Fe would react with Cl2 in a 1:3 ratio (Fe + 3Cl2 → FeCl3). So 8 equivalents would imply Fe is in a higher stoichiometric ratio. Wait, but perhaps A is something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is not Cl2. What other common reactions involve 8 equivalents? Wait, another thought: maybe it's the formation of a dichromate. Chromium(III) oxide reacts with KCl to form K2Cr2O7. But that's more about acid-base reactions, perhaps not directly related.

Wait, another approach: the product C when reacted with D in a 2:1 ratio produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to form A, and two acids F (strong) and G (weak). So, when C is treated with water, it produces acid F and acid G. That suggests that C might be a salt that can hydrolyze. For example, if C is a nitride or a sulfide, but those typically produce bases. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal oxide that's amphoteric.

Wait, but if C reacts with water to produce two acids, F and G, that suggests that C could be a more complex oxide, perhaps a mixed oxide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate that decomposes upon heating, but that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe C is a dichloride or some other chloride. Wait, let's think of the hydrolysis products. Suppose C is Na2O2. No, that when water would produce NaOH and O2, which is a base. But the problem says two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is something like SO3. When SO3 is treated with water, it forms H2SO4 (a strong acid) and H2SO3 (but wait, H2SO3 is not a strong acid, it's a weak acid, I think). Wait, but wait, does SO3 react with water to form both H2SO4 and H2SO3? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a peroxide, but peroxides usually produce basic solutions upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: if when C reacts with D (gas) in a 1:1 ratio, it forms H, which is a solvent. D and B react in 1:1 to form H. So D is a gas, B is a gas; their reaction forms H, which is a commonly used solvent. Common solvents include water, but D and B are both gases, so maybe D is HCl and B is something else? Or perhaps D is NH3 and B is something else.

Wait, let's think: H must be something like H2O, which is a solvent. So if D and B react to form H, which is H2O. So D and B could be gases like HCl and NaOH, but that's not possible because both are not in gas form under standard conditions. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, but that's for forming H2O via combustion or something else.

Wait, alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2? Because H2 + Cl2 → HCl (when点燃), but that's a gas reaction. But H would then be HCl, which is a gas, but the problem says H is a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That could fit: O2 + H2 → H2O (with a spark). But in that case, B is O2 and D is H2.

Wait, let me see: if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. So when C reacts with D (H2) in a 2:1 ratio, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. What reactions involve H2 and a solid in such a ratio?

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with D (H2) in a 1:2 ratio (since it's 2 equivalents of D per 1 of C?), perhaps it's a reduction reaction. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, which reacts with H2 to form metal and water, but that would produce H2O as a byproduct, which isn't E. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like AlN, which reacts with H2 to form NH3 or something? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the first reaction. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. So the molar ratio is A:B:C as 1:8:1. Maybe this reaction is similar to the formation of a metal oxide, like Fe + O2 → FeO (but that's not 8 equivalents). Alternatively, think about a reaction where multiple moles of a gas react with a solid. For example, the formation of Na2O2 from Na and O2: 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. But that's 2 equivalents. So 1:8 ratio would imply a more complex reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is carbon (solid), and B is oxygen gas (O2). Then, the reaction could be forming CO2, which is a gas, but the product is C, which is solid. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is Cl2, forming a metal chloride. For a 1:8 ratio, perhaps it's a +3 oxidation state, but 8 Cl per metal atom seems too high. Wait, perhaps it's a different stoichiometry. Let me think: Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2, which is 1 Mg : 2 Cl2. So 8 equivalents would be 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Mg. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a compound with multiple atoms. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and B is Cl2: Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But FeCl3 is a solid. However, the stoichiometry is 1 Fe : 3 Cl2, so 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Fe, which would be FeCl4, but I don't think Fe forms a +4 oxidation state? Or maybe it's a different metal.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (solid), and B is O2. S + O2 → SO3? But that's 1 S : 3 O2. So 3 equivalents. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is phosphorus (P4) reacting with O2 to form P4O10. The reaction is P4 + 5 O2 → P4O10. So that's 5 O2 per mole of P4. That's 5 equivalents. Still not 8.

Hmm, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a compound with a high oxidation state. For example, lead(IV) oxide, PbO2, which is a solid. PbO2 is dark brown, but perhaps not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide.

Wait, bright red makes me think of mercuric oxide, HgO, which is red. But HgO is a solid, and the reaction would be Hg + O2 → HgO. The stoichiometry is 1 Hg : 1 O2, so 1 equivalent. But the problem says 8 equivalents, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is Na and B is Cl2, then 2 Na + Cl2 → NaCl. So 1 Cl2 per 2 Na. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 Cl2 per mole of Na? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex ion. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something like aluminum reacting with oxygen to form Al₂O₃. The reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al₂O₃. So 3 equivalents of O2 per 4 Al. Not matching 8.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a metal carbonate. For example, if A is CaO (solid) and B is CO2 (gas), then CaO + CO2 → CaCO3. The stoichiometry is 1:1. So 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of CO2 per mole of CaO, which doesn't make sense. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a nitride. For example, Mg reacts with N2 to form Mg3N2. The reaction is Mg + N2 → Mg3N2. The stoichiometry is 3 Mg : 1 N2. So 8 equivalents would be more than that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product E. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it forms E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, E is produced from C and D. What's an extremely hazardous product? Maybe something like chlorine gas? But that's D perhaps. Or maybe something like phosgene? Or a nerve agent? Alternatively, perhaps E is something like hydrogen fluoride, but that's not extremely hazardous in a reaction.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if A is a metal, then C could be a higher oxide. For example, if A is Fe metal (Fe), and C is FeO. Then, FeO reacts with water to form Fe(OH)2, which is not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that's amphoteric. For example, Al2O3 reacts with water to form NaOH and H2SO4 or something. Wait, no, Al2O3 is amphoteric and can react with strong acids or bases, but producing H+ or OH-.

Wait, another thought: Suppose C is a nitride, like Si3N4. When Si3N4 reacts with water, it produces H2SiO4 (which is a weak acid) and NH4OH (but that's a base, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, ZnS reacts with water to form H2S (a weak acid) and Zn(OH)2 (a base). But the problem states that two acids are formed. So that wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. Like Na2O2. Na2O2 reacts with water to produce NaOH (a strong base) and O2. Doesn't fit because we're getting a base and a gas, but the problem says two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the hydrolysis products. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4. Weak acids include acetic acid, H3PO4, HCOOH, etc.

If C is a salt that upon hydrolysis forms both a strong and a weak acid, perhaps it's a mixed salt. For example, perhaps a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate, like Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it just dissociates into nitrate ions, which is a strong acid (since HNO3 is strong). So maybe that's F, but then where does G come from? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, which when hydrolyzed in water would stay as sulfate (HSO4^- which is a weak acid). But that would only give a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the hydrolysis is more complicated. Suppose C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When CaSO3 reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But again, that's a base and an acid. But the problem says two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much, but if it's treated with an acid, it would produce CO2 and the corresponding salt. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a higher oxide, like CrO3. CrO3 is a strong oxidizing agent. When it reacts with water, it can form H2CrO4 (a strong acid) and possibly some other products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with D (in 1:2 ratio) produces E. E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas, like HCl? Or perhaps something like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product like phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. But how would that form?

Wait, if C is something like a dichloride, and D is Cl2, then perhaps C + D → some Cl-containing compound. For example, maybe C is NaCl and D is Cl2: 2 NaCl + Cl2 → 2 NaCl + 2 HCl (but that's not making sense, because that's the same as before). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide, and D is Cl2. For example, if C is FeO and D is Cl2: FeO + Cl2 → ...? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is water, then B and D must react to form H2O. What gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form water? H2 and O2. 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2. So that's 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B and D are CO2 and NaOH, but both are not gases. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O. But H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, not matching.

Another angle: H is a solvent, so perhaps H is ethanol or something else. But D and B are gases, so their reaction should form a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3 (a gas, but not a solvent in this context), but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think of B and D as O2 and H2, respectively, in a 1:1 ratio. But O2 and H2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form water. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else, but both can't be gases.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the possible compounds.

If product E is extremely hazardous, it might be something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but that's a gas. Or maybe a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, maybe E is a product like chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which is highly reactive and dangerous. But how would that form?

Wait, going back to the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. If A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps like O2 or Cl2. Let's say B is Cl2. So 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So, for a metal with a valency that would require 8 Cl atoms, the metal would need to have a +4 oxidation state, because 8 Cl- would come from 4 Cl2 molecules. So, the formula would be MCl4. So if A is Sn (tin), which can form SnCl4, but SnCl4 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metalloid. For example, S (sulfur) reacting with O2 to form SO3. The reaction is S + O2 → SO3. But the stoichiometry is 1 S : 3 O2, so 3 equivalents. Not 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal like carbon. Reacting with O2 would form CO2. But again, stoichiometry doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of a complex oxide. For example, if A is a metal and B is CO2, forming a carbonate. But the stoichiometry would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is O2, forming a high oxidation state oxide. For example, PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide) is a solid. The reaction would be Pb + O2 → PbO2. The stoichiometry is 1 Pb : 1 O2, so 1 equivalent. Not 8.

Hmm, maybe I should think of A as a metal and B as Cl2. For example, if A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. The reaction is Fe + 3 Cl2 → FeCl3. So for 1 Fe, 3 Cl2 are used. But the problem states 8 equivalents, so 8 Cl2 per Fe. That would imply FeCl4, but I don't think Fe typically forms a +4 oxidation state. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: if A is aluminum metal (Al), and B is Cl2, then the reaction would be 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a +2 oxidation state, and 8 Cl2 would imply 8 Cl per metal atom. So the formula would be MCl8. But that's unusual. Most metals form up to +6 or +4. Maybe it's a transition metal with a higher oxidation state. For example, perhaps ruthenium or osmium.

Wait, if A is Ru metal, then RuCl8 might form. But Ru in +4 oxidation state would have RuCl4, not RuCl8. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe A is a sulfide, and B is O2, forming a sulfate. For example, S reacting with O2 to form SO4^2-.

Wait, but S + O2 → SO3 (or SO2), not directly to sulfate. Unless it's in the presence of water.

Another thought: perhaps A is a carbonate, and B is HCl gas. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives two acids. For example, if C is a double oxide, like Pb3O4, which can be considered as PbO·Pb2O3. Upon hydrolysis, it might produce both H2O and some acidic products. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. No, because that would produce a base upon hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydroxide. But again, hydrolysis would produce a base.

Wait, I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the overall picture. Let's try to piece together the reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent, probably H2O)

From reaction 4: B + D → H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then B and D must react to form water. The possible gases are H2 and O2. So B could be H2 and D could be O2. But then, how would that fit into the other reactions?

Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2, then reaction 4 is O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So 2 H2 : 1 O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says B and D react in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else, but both are gases. Or maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl, but they would react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2O (but it's a liquid, not a gas) and D is something else. Hmm, this isn't working.

Wait, maybe H is ethanol (a solvent), so B and D could be C2H5OH-related, but that doesn't make sense since they are gases.

Back to reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So if A is a metal, then C could be a higher oxide. For example, if A is Fe metal, then C could be FeO (but that's not red), or Fe3O4 (magnetite, which is black). Alternatively, if A is Al, then C could be Al2O3, which is white.

Wait, but the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(I) oxide, HgO, which is red. So perhaps C is HgO.

If C is HgO, then when it reacts with D, which is what? HgO + 2 D → E. And E is extremely hazardous.

Wait, let me think: HgO is a red solid. It can react with Cl2 to form HgCl2, which is a white solid (mercurous chloride). But that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, HgO can react with H2S to form HgS, which is a red solid (mercuric sulfide, also known as cinnabar). But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl gas? But that would imply D is Cl2, and C is HgO:

HgO + 2 Cl2 → HgCl2 + O2. But I'm not sure about the products here.

Wait, another angle: if C is HgO, and it reacts with H2 (D is H2), then HgO + H2 → Hg + H2O. But that's a reaction, but E would be Hg, which isn't extremely hazardous (though mercury is toxic, but perhaps not in this context).

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives a strong and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium carbonate (but that's not a solid formed by a reaction with 8 equivalents of a gas). Or perhaps C is a nitrate.

Alternatively, maybe C is ammonium nitrate, which is a white solid, but when hydrolyzed, it can form nitric acid (strong) and ammonium hydroxide (weak base), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. How would that form?

Phosgene is formed by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with excess chlorine under certain conditions. But I'm not sure how that would tie into the other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like diphosgene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If C is COCl2 (phosgene), but that's a gas, not a solid.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up on the actual compounds and think about the symmetry groups of possible products.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

D∞h symmetry is typically for linear molecules with an infinite number of planes of symmetry. For example, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But wait, no, CO2 is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and two-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the axis. So its point group is D∞h.

Wait, no, CO2 is actually a linear molecule with point group D∞h. But wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. The point group of CO2 is actually D∞h. Wait, no, wait: The point group for a linear molecule like CO2 is D∞h. Because it has a principal axis (C∞), and two-fold perpendicular axes (each C2), and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, I might be mixing up with other groups.

Wait, another example: HCN is a linear molecule with point group D∞h. O2 has D∞h symmetry as well.

Wait, the options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

So, if E is O2, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But earlier I thought O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, O2 is a diradical with two atoms, so it's linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Another possibility: if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which is a trigonal planar molecule. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is planar but with a C2v symmetry. Because it has a central C=O, and two Cl atoms attached. The symmetry elements would include a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane, and two mirror planes. Wait, the point group for phosgene is D∞h? Or C2v?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think: Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. It's a trigonal planar molecule. The symmetry operations include a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (rotation by 180 degrees swaps the two Cl atoms), and two mirror planes that bisect the angle between the Cl atoms. So the point group is D∞h? Or C2v.

Wait, no, the point group for O=C(Cl)2 is D∞h. Because D∞h includes a principal axis (C∞), which isn't the case here because it's trigonal planar (so only a C3 axis if it were, but it's C2 here). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, D∞h requires a molecule with a principal axis of infinite order, which only occurs in linear molecules. Since phosgene is trigonal planar, its symmetry is lower.

Wait, phosgene has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. It also has two mirror planes that bisect the angle between the two Cl atoms. So the point group would be D2h? Or perhaps C2v.

Wait, I think the correct point group for phosgene is C2v. Because it has a C2 axis, a vertical mirror plane (σv), and another mirror plane that is not perpendicular (σd). Alternatively, perhaps it's D∞h, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a gas, but the problem says E is a product formed from C and D, which is extremely hazardous. Cl2 is hazardous, but maybe it's possible.

Wait, but if E is Cl2, then the reaction would be C + 2 D → Cl2. But D is another gas, perhaps H2? So C + 2 H2 → Cl2? I don't think that's a typical reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like HCl gas, but HCl is a gas, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Wait, perhaps E is a product like HCN, which is a linear molecule. HCN has D∞h symmetry.

Another possibility: if E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or HCN, then the answer would be D∞h.

But I'm not entirely sure about the compounds involved. Let me try to think again of the reactions.

If reaction 4 is B + D → H, which is a solvent (probably H2O). So, B and D must be H2 and O2, but in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O (but D is a gas, so that can't be).

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O (but it's a liquid), which doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another angle. The symmetry groups:

- C2: has a single twofold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry), so maybe something else.

- D4h: includes a fourfold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Examples include SO2 (which is bent, but actually has C2v symmetry), so maybe something else.

- D∞h: linear molecules with infinite-fold rotation, like O2, HCN, CO2.

- C2v: includes a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes. For example, phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which is trigonal planar.

So, if E is a linear molecule like O2 or HCN, its symmetry group is D∞h. If E is a trigonal planar molecule like phosgene, symmetry group is C2v.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas. Phosgene is highly toxic, but it's a trigonal planar molecule with C2v symmetry. Alternatively, O2 is not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but in high concentrations it can be.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3, which is a trigonal pyramidal molecule. ClF3 has a C3v symmetry. Hmm, not matching the options.

Wait, another possibility: E is a product like NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous. Wait, no, NH3 is toxic but not in the same way as phosgene.

Alternatively, E could be a nerve agent like sarin, which has a certain symmetry. But I don't know their point groups.

Given the options, if I had to guess, I'd think that E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like HgO (mercury(I) oxide). However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear, but the stoichiometry and product suggest a high oxidation state or a complex reaction.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This reaction implies a transformation involving C and D to form a highly toxic compound. Possible candidates for E include highly toxic gases like phosgene (COCl₂) or linear molecules like HCN, which are known for their hazardous properties.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests C is likely an amphoteric compound or a complex oxide that hydrolyzes to yield both strong and weak acids.

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. The most plausible solvent here is water (H₂O), implying B and D could be gases like H₂ and O₂, which react to form water. However, the stoichiometry of this reaction does not perfectly align with the 1:1 ratio.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- **Option A (C2)**: This point group involves a single twofold rotation axis. Molecules like H₂O (though H₂O actually has C₂v symmetry) or simple linear molecules could fit this group, but E is described as extremely hazardous, which aligns more with higher symmetry groups.

- **Option B (D₄h)**: This point group includes a fourfold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Examples include SO₂ (which is bent and has C₂v symmetry), but this group does not match the likely linear or trigonal planar nature of E.

- **Option C (D∞h)**: This point group applies to linear molecules with infinite-fold rotational symmetry, such as O₂, HCN, or CO₂. These molecules are consistent with the description of E as extremely hazardous, as linear molecules like phosgene (COCl₂) or HCN are known for their toxicity.

- **Option D (C₂v)**: This point group includes a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes. A molecule like phosgene (O=C(Cl)₂), which is trigonal planar and highly toxic, fits this group. However, the problem suggests E is extremely hazardous, and while phosgene is toxic, it is not as universally hazardous as linear molecules like O₂ or HCN.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the description of E as extremely hazardous, the most likely symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, as it aligns with linear molecules like HCN or O₂, which are known for their hazardous properties. 

Answer: C
