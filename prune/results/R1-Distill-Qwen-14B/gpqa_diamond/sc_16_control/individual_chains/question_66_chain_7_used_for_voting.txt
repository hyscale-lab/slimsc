Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that its operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each a combination of these.

First, I need to recall what SMEFT is. From what I remember, SMEFT is an effective field theory framework that encapsulates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added to account for physics beyond the SM, like new heavy particles or new interactions. The idea is that these operators are organized by their dimension and must respect certain symmetries.

Wait, what are the symmetries that SMEFT respects by construction? I think SMEFT maintains the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So whatever the SM respects, SMEFT does as well. But wait, the question is about operators in SMEFT, not the SM.

Let me go through each option.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator added in SMEFT must also be Lorentz-invariant. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, does it automatically have Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes things like momentum conservation and translation invariance. The SM is translation-invariant, so SMEFT, as an effective theory that includes the SM, would also be translation-invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare is a bigger symmetry group than Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Wait, in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect both or just one?

Wait, no. Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. So if operators are Lorentz-symmetric, they are automatically respecting part of Poincare. But do SMEFT operators need to respect the entire Poincare symmetry? I think that since effective field theories are usually based on the same symmetries as the underlying theory (like the SM), which includes Poincare. So yes, Poincare must be respected. So 2 is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The SMEFT operators are written in a way that they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But Poincare includes diffeomorphisms, right? No, wait, no. Effective field theories are typically formulated in a fixed background, so maybe Poincare symmetry isn't the same as general covariance. The SM and SMEFT are built in a way that respects Poincare symmetry because they're relativistic theories. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe when people talk about SMEFT, the operators are required to respect the same gauge and global symmetries as the SM, but are they required to respect diffeomorphisms? No, because SMEFT is an effective theory in a fixed spacetime background, so diffeomorphisms (which are part of general relativity) aren't necessarily part of the symmetry. So maybe Poincare is not enforced? Or is it that SMEFT includes all the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincare? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect all aspects of Poincare symmetry beyond Lorentz, but I think in this case, since Poincare includes Lorentz and translation, and SMEFT is a field theory, the operators must respect both Lorentz and translation invariance. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

3. CP symmetry: The SM has CP symmetry (except for certain parts, like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation). But in SMEFT, operators can violate CP. Because, for example, some higher-dimensional operators are CP-even, others are CP-odd. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not necessarily a required symmetry. Therefore, 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM is CPT symmetric. I think that SMEFT is also constructed to be CPT invariant because the underlying physics (even beyond SM) is expected to respect CPT (except in some extreme cases, but generally, I think SMEFT maintains CPT). So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are the operators themselves required to respect CPT symmetry, or is it the theory as a whole that respects CPT? Because CPT is a combination of C, P, and T. If the theory is CPT invariant, that doesn't necessarily mean each operator is individually invariant under CPT. Instead, the theory's overall symmetry would imply that the combination of operators respects CPT. So maybe the question is about each operator respecting certain symmetries. Hmm, no, because the question asks which symmetries must be respected 'by all operators in SMEFT'. So each operator must be a scalar under each of these symmetries.

Wait, no. For example, an operator could change under a symmetry, but that's allowed if the combination of operators in the theory remains invariant. But the question specifies that each operator must respect the symmetry, I think. Or perhaps that the entire theory must respect them. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the operators must be invariant under those symmetries. I think that's the correct way to interpret it. Because, for example, if an operator is not a Lorentz scalar, then the theory isn't Lorentz-invariant. So each operator must be Lorentz-invariant, Poincare-invariant, etc.

Wait, but I'm not sure about CPT. Because CPT symmetry in a theory doesn't necessarily mean each operator is individually CPT-symmetric. Instead, the combination of the operators and their coefficients would have to transform in a way that the theory remains consistent. So perhaps the operators themselves don't have to be CPT-symmetric, but the theory as a whole must respect CPT. So I'm a bit confused about 4.

Alternatively, maybe the operator's form must be invariant under CPT. Because CPT is a symmetry of the theory, any operator must be a scalar under CPT? Or perhaps not. Let me think. For example, an operator could have an explicit CP violation, but the CPT symmetry would require that its CPT conjugate is also present.

Wait, maybe the question is more about which symmetries are automatically respected by the SMEFT framework, regardless of the operator. So for example, SMEFT must be a Lorentz-invariant theory, so any operator added must be a Lorentz scalar. Similarly, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, so operators must also be translation-invariant scalars. But wait, translation invariance would mean that the operators don't have explicit dependence on spacetime coordinates, but in effective field theories, operators are local, so they are built from fields and derivatives, which are translation-invariant. So all operators are automatically translation-invariant, so they respect Poincare? Hmm, perhaps.

But I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should think about each option one by one.

Option 1: Lorentz Symmetry. Yes, all operators must be Lorentz scalars, so this is correct.

Option 2: Poincare symmetry. Since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, but SMEFT is built as a theory that includes translation invariance, so operators must be Poincare scalars. So 2 is correct.

Option 3: CP symmetry. Not necessarily. Operators can violate CP; for example, operators like (Dμ H)† D^μ H are CP-even, but others could have CP-odd structures if possible. Wait, but wait, the SM Higgs potential is CP-even, but in SMEFT, operators can have terms that are CP-odd. So operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is incorrect.

Option 4: CPT symmetry. The SM respects CPT, and SMEFT is built as an effective theory that incorporates the same symmetries as the SM, so I think the SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait. CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. So if the theory is CPT symmetric, then the combination of C, P, and T holds. But individual operators don't have to be CPT invariant. For example, an operator could be C-even but P-odd, but then under T, perhaps it's even. But in any case, the operator must transform in a way that when combined with other terms, the entire theory remains CPT invariant. But the question is whether each operator must respect CPT symmetry. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators". So each operator must be invariant under that symmetry. So for example, each operator must be a scalar under CPT. But that's not the case. Because some operators could change under C, others under P, etc. But the theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the operator's form must be such that it is a scalar under the symmetry. So for Lorentz, each operator must be a scalar. For CPT, each operator must be a scalar under CPT. Otherwise, when you apply CPT, the operator would change, which would imply the theory isn't CPT-invariant.

Wait, but CPT is a combination of the three. So perhaps an operator doesn't need to be individually CPT-symmetric, but under the combination, the theory as a whole must be symmetric. So maybe the individual operators don't have to transform in any particular way under CPT, but their coefficients must adjust such that the entire theory remains CPT-invariant.

But the question is phrased as "which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?"

Alternatively, I'm perhaps overcomplicating. Let me think about how the SMEFT is constructed. SMEFT is built on the same gauge symmetry as the SM, but not necessarily other symmetries like CP or CPT. Therefore, operators can violate these symmetries, but the theory as a whole must be consistent with the SM's symmetries, which do include CPT.

Wait, but the SM is CPT symmetric, but some of its operators (like the CKM matrix) can lead to CP violation. So I'm a bit confused again.

Wait, the SM is CPT symmetric, but it allows for CP violation. So in the SM, the theory is CPT invariant, but not necessarily CP invariant. So SMEFT is built to maintain the same symmetries as the SM, meaning it must respect CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So for the question: which symmetries must all operators respect.

As for Lorentz and Poincare: yes, because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory.

CP: No, because the operators can violate CP. So option 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

CPT: The theory as a whole must respect CPT, but what about individual operators? If the theory is CPT-invariant, then the operator's form must be such that when you apply CPT, you get a combination that's consistent. But perhaps each operator doesn't have to individually be invariant under CPT, but the entire Lagrangian must be invariant.

Wait, but the question says "all operators in the SMEFT must respect". So for the entire theory to respect CPT, each operator must transform in a way that when combined with other terms, the CPT symmetry is maintained. So perhaps each operator must be a scalar under CPT. Otherwise, their presence would break CPT.

Alternatively, maybe the operator's form must be such that it's a scalar under CPT. So for example, if an operator is C-even, P-odd, T-odd, then under CPT, it would have a certain transformation.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Another approach: which of these symmetries are gauge symmetries of the SMEFT? Well, the SMEFT includes the SM gauge symmetries (SU(3), SU(2), U(1)), but Lorentz symmetry is a spacetime symmetry, not a gauge symmetry.

So, the framework of SMEFT requires that the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes both translations and Lorentz. Since the operators are local and built from fields and derivatives (which are translation-invariant), the operators are automatically translation-invariant. So they must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct.

CP symmetry is not required, as operators can violate CP. So 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry: Since the SM is CPT-invariant, and SMEFT is built as an effective theory that includes the SM, the SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about whether each operator must individually respect CPT, or just the theory as a whole. For the theory as a whole to respect CPT, the operators in the Lagrangian must transform in such a way that when you apply CPT, the Lagrangian remains the same. So each operator must transform into itself or another operator such that the overall Lagrangian is invariant.

But the question is about the operators themselves, not the Lagrangian. So perhaps each operator must be a scalar under CPT.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct approach is to think which symmetries are part of the micro symmetries that SMEFT respects. The SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. So SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM. So operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, but the SM doesn't necessarily respect CP. It has CP violation in the CKM matrix. So the SM doesn't require operators to be CP-symmetric. Therefore, SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either, but must respect CPT because the SM is CPT-symmetric.

Wait, but CPT is a bigger symmetry. If the SM is CPT-symmetric, then any effective theory derived from it must also be CPT-symmetric. So SMEFT must respect CPT. Therefore, all operators must be CPT scalars. Or perhaps not. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if both 1 and 2 are correct, then the correct options would include both. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 and option A is 1 and 2.

So now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what the options are.

The options are:

A) 1,2 (so Lorentz and Poincare)

B) 3,4 (CP and CPT)

C) 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT)

D) 1,3,4 (Lorentz, CP, CPT)

Hmm. So between options C and D and perhaps A.

Wait, but I think that the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, but not necessarily CP. And they must respect CPT. Because the SM is CPT-symmetric, so any effective theory derived from it must be as well.

Wait, but if the SM is CPT-symmetric, then any operator in SMEFT must contribute to maintaining that symmetry. So perhaps all operators must be CPT-invariant. So 4 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but do they have to respect Poincare? Or is Poincare automatically respected because the operators are written in a way that respects Lorentz and translation invariance.

Wait, perhaps the key is that all operators in SMEFT are required to be Lorentz scalars, translation-invariant, and CPT scalars. So 1,2,4 are correct, which is option C.

Wait, but why would the operators respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, which are automatically respected if the operators are local. So yes, perhaps 2 is correct.

So according to this reasoning, the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

But wait, in the question, option C is 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but I'm not sure about whether Poincare is a must. Because SMEFT is a field theory, and field theories are Poincare-invariant by construction. So all operators must be Poincare scalars.

So based on this, the correct answer would include 1,2,4, which is option C. But wait, I'm not entirely confident about the CPT part.

Another approach: I remember that the SMEFT maintains the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Lorentz-invariant, translation-invariant (so Poincare), gauge-invariant, and CPT-invariant. But the SM is not necessarily CP-invariant.

So SMEFT must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT but not necessarily CP.

So the answer would be 1,2,4. So the option is C.

But wait, the question is which of the choices is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 1,2,4.

Yes, that would be the correct answer.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM), which include Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. However, SMEFT does not necessarily respect CP symmetry, as operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, as the theory is Lorentz-invariant. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic effective field theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, operators are automatically translation-invariant and local, ensuring Poincare symmetry. Thus, Poincare symmetry must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT inherits this feature. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP, so CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-invariant, and SMEFT, as an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). This corresponds to **Option C**.
