Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about titration, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they should neutralize each other to form acetate ions and water. 

Let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total solution volume becomes 40 cm³, 0.04 liters. 

So the first step is to find the concentration after dilution. The moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Okay, let's tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from before). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence (V_eq) is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about the pH at equivalence, not the volume needed. 

At equivalence, the solution is the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic because the acetate ion is a weak base.

The concentration of acetate ions in the solution at equivalence can be found by considering the total volume. Let's think: the original solution is 40 cm³ (20 +20), and when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH (since V_eq is 10 cm³), the total volume becomes 50 cm³, 0.05 L.

The moles of acetate are the same as the moles of acetic acid initially, 0.001 mol. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is CH3COO^-. It reacts with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5. So 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1/(1.85e5 * 1e-14) → Wait, no, wait: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Right.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10. Now, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-
So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:

Kb ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small compared to 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1/[OH^-]) = log(1e5 / 1.04) ≈ log(9.615e4) ≈ 4.983. So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017. Hmm, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pH values are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. Wait, none of these are around 9. So did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. After adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 moles, yes. So all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate. The total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M acetate. That's correct.

Kb is correct at 5.405e-10.

So the calculation for [OH^-] is correct, leading to pOH around 5, pH around 9. But none of the options have a pH near 9 at equivalence. Hmm. That suggests I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the activity coefficients or the exact calculation without approximation. Let me try the exact equation.

Set up Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So same result.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options have a different approach or I'm missing something else. Hmm. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the initial dilution is not 40 cm³. Wait, the problem says: we dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. So total volume is 40.00 cm³, correct.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the dilution correctly. Let me check the initial moles again. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct. Diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.025 M, correct.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So the pH at equivalence should be about 9.01, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92

Hmm, all equivalence points are below 7 except for option A, which is 8.52. But my calculation said about 9.01, which is even higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the concentration. Let me think again. Wait, when the solution is at equivalence, the sodium acetate is 0.02 M, right? Or did I forget to account for the dilution when adding the NaOH?

Wait, when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of acetic acid solution, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct. So why is the pH not matching any options? Maybe the problem is that the acetate ion is a weak base, but perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a weak base solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for acetate. So the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Another approach: the hydrolysis of CH3COO^- can be treated using the formula pH = pKa2 + pKw? No, wait. Let me think. For acetate, the relevant reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this is 5.405e-10, as before.

The formula for the pH of a weak base is pH = (pKb + pOH) → No, wait, the pH is 14 - pOH. So pOH = (1/2)(pKb - log C), but wait, the correct approach is more like:

For a weak base, [OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C ). Because Kb is small, so approx [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C).

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

But none of the options have equivalence pH near 9. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, maybe the error is in the initial dilution. Let me re-calculate the concentration after dilution.

The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when you titrate, the volume of the solution changes. So when you reach 25% titration, how much NaOH have you added?

Wait, the first part is about 25% titration, so that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So equivalence volume is V_eq = 0.01 L (10 cm³), as calculated. So 25% is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach the pH at 25% point differently. Let me tackle that first, maybe that will help.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So initial moles after dilution: 0.001 mol CH3COOH.

After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So total 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is from Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ log(1/(1.85e-5)) = 4.736.

So pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → let's compute the ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259 → approximately 4.26. That matches option A's first pH value of 4.26.

So the pH at 25% titration is around 4.26. Looking at the options, only option A and D have 4.26 or close. Option A's first value is 4.26, and D's is 4.57.

Now, what about the equivalence point? Earlier calculation suggests pH around 9, but the options don't have that. But perhaps my calculation is wrong. Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the dilution correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the equivalence point correctly.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.05 L (50 cm³) of 0.02 M sodium acetate. So the concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, wait, maybe using the formula for the pH of a salt solution of a weak base. Let me compute the pH again.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

The formula is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10 → x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 → [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.017.

But again, the options don't have this. So why is this discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe I should consider that the solution is not just acetate ion, but perhaps the dilution is affecting it. Wait, no, the concentration is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial calculation was correct, but the options have a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option A: equivalence pH is 8.52. Which is about 8.5. That's lower than 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate Kb. Let me compute that again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

Compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. So why the pH is not matching any options. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the problem calculates the pH at the equivalence point assuming that the solution is a mixture of a weak acid and strong base in a different way. Or perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like the exact solution without the approximation.

Let me try solving without approximation.

The equation is x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

But if we don't make that approximation, perhaps x is not so small?

Wait, let's compute x^2 = 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x) → x^2 + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) ≈ 2.921e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈ approx 4.324e-11.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 + sqrt(4.324e-11) ] / 2.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x ≈ ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.576e-6/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 6.576e-6 is much larger than 5.4e-10, so the approximation holds. So x ≈3.288e-6? Wait, that can't be right because earlier approximation gave x=1.04e-5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation. Because 5.4e-10 is a very small number, so x is much smaller than 0.02.

So I think the initial calculation is correct, and the [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pH around 9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is using the pKa of the acetate ion in a different way or I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect. Let me recheck.

The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluted with 20 cm³ water → 40 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when the solution is titrated, the volume changes. So when 25% of the equivalence volume is added, that's 2.5 cm³, making the total volume 42.5 cm³, but perhaps I should have considered that when calculating concentrations.

Wait, but I did that earlier for the 25% titration. So that led to pH ~4.26, which matches option A's first value.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26, and at equivalence, around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps at equivalence, the solution is a buffer? No, no, equivalence is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, making only acetate ions.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I forgot that the solution at equivalence point is a sodium salt, but perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis correctly. Or perhaps the question's options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculations for the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact formula for the hydrolysis of acetate.

The equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb = 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.

Let x be [OH^-].

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial problem is that I should have considered the total volume at equivalence point as 40 +10 =50 cm³, but perhaps the calculation is correct but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach for the equivalence point calculation. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the pH at equivalence based on the half-equivalence point, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a weak base in a different way. Let me think about the exact expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), which gives the same result as before.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, the equivalence point pH for option D is 6.92, which is close to 7. Why would the equivalence point be near 7? Because for a weak acid with a pKa around 4.73, the equivalence point would be in the basic range because the salt (sodium acetate) is a weak base. So pH >7.

So perhaps the options are incorrect, but the correct pH calculated is around 9.

But given the options, the only one with pH around 4.26 for 25% is option A.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but why in the equivalence point the option says 8.52? That's lower than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.736.

Wait, when I calculated Kb, it's 5.405e-10, but maybe I should use 5.405e-10 as Kb, which would give a pKb of 9.268 (since pKb = log(1/(5.405e-10)) )) → wait, pKb is log(1/(5.405e-10)) )= log(1.85e9) → which is about 9.268. So pOH would be 0.5 * pKb → 4.634 → pH = 14 -4.634=9.366. Hmm, but that's even higher than before.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the pH at equivalence is determined by the concentration of sodium acetate, which is a weak base, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the formula pH = pKa2 + pOH, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I forgot that the solution is made by mixing, and the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. But that shouldn't affect the equivalence point's pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the initial calculation of the moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So to reach equivalence, you need 0.001 mol NaOH, so volume is 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L =10 cm³.

So the solution at equivalence is 10 cm³ NaOH added to 40 cm³ solution, total 50 cm³. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. Since the 25% titration pH is 4.26, which matches option A, and equivalence point in option A is 8.52. So perhaps the mistake is that the problem is using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation incorrectly at equivalence? Or perhaps the answer expects me to use the pH at equivalence point as 8.52, which is about 14 -5.48, so pOH=5.48, which would imply [OH^-] is about 3e-6.

Wait, if pH=8.52, then pOH=5.48, so [OH^-]=10^(-5.48)= approx 3.2e-6.

So Kb = [OH^-]^2 / C = (3.2e-6)^2 /0.02 → 1.024e-11 /0.02 =5.12e-10. Which is close to the Kb I calculated (5.405e-10). So perhaps the pH is approximated as 8.52. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Kw or Ka. Let me check.

Ka given is 1.85e-5. So pKa is 4.736.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value for Kb, like 5.4e-10, but when calculating, perhaps it rounds the pH to two decimal places.

Wait, my calculation gave [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is lower. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula pH = pKa + log ( (n_base)/(n_acid) ) at equivalence, but that's not applicable because at equivalence, all acid is neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the solution. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not using the correct initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution after dilution is 20.00 cm3 of acetic acid in 20.00 cm³ of water, making 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: Maybe the problem uses the pH at equivalence as the pKa of the conjugate base. Wait, the pKa of acetate would be pKa2 of acetic acid, which is pKa2= pKa of acetate = 4.736. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence is 8.52 because the problem calculates it using a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the exact formula without the approximation.

So Kb = 5.405e-10, C=0.02 M.

The equation is x^2 = Kb*(C -x) → x^2 + Kb x - Kb C =0.

Using quadratic formula, x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4 Kb C)] /2.

Plugging in the numbers:

Kb =5.405e-10, C=0.02.

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *5.405e-10 *0.02 ) ] /2.

Compute the discriminant:

D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *5.405e-10 *0.02 → 2.921e-19 + 4.324e-11 → ~4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)≈6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! So I see now. Earlier, I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. I thought x was 1e-5, but it's actually 3.288e-6, which leads to pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Wait, so why did I get two different values earlier? Oh, I see, because when I set up the quadratic equation, I made a mistake in the calculation.

So the correct [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6, which gives a pH of 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52, matching option A.

So putting it all together:

At 25% titration, pH is 4.26.

At equivalence, pH is 8.52.

So the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The key steps are as follows:

---

### **Initial Setup**
- **Initial acetic acid solution**: 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid.
  - Moles of acetic acid = \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).
- **Dilution**: 20.00 cm³ of water is added, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L).
  - New concentration of acetic acid = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- Moles of NaOH added = \( 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).
- Reaction: \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \).
  - Remaining moles of acetic acid = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).
  - Moles of acetate ion formed = \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).
- Total volume after titration = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 \, (0.0425 \, \text{L}) \).
  - Concentration of acetic acid = \( \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M} \).
  - Concentration of acetate ion = \( \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M} \).
- Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
  \]
  where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736 \).
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) \approx 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.26.
  \]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions:
- Moles of acetate ion = \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).
- Total volume = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \, (0.05 \, \text{L}) \).
  - Concentration of acetate ion = \( \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).
- Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  - \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).
  - Using the formula for weak base hydrolysis:
    \[
    [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
    \]
  - pOH = \( -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48 \).
  - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52 \).
