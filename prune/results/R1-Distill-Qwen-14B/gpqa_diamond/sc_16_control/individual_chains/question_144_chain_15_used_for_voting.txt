Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers, so I'll have to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or proper mean decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula should be something like c multiplied by the lifetime, but wait, the lifetime depends on the width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The formula is τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I think it's actually τ = ħ/(Γ), right? Because Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse lifetime.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Correct.

But wait, there's another thing. The mean decay length L is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = v * c * τ. Wait, no, velocity is in terms of c. So v is the particle's velocity, which is less than c, but for high-energy particles, it's approximately c. But let's see.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ.
2. Find the velocity v of the particle.
3. Compute the mean decay distance L = v * τ * c.

Wait, but how do I find v? I know the production energy, mass, so maybe I can find the velocity from the energy.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can find γ from E, then find v.

Given E_X is 8 GeV and mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Wait, but I should express E in terms of m. Let me calculate γ.

γ = E / (m c²). Since E is in GeV and m is also in GeV/c² (since E=mc²), but the units might complicate things. Wait, perhaps I should just compute γ as E/(m c²) but considering the units. Wait, actually, when units are consistent, E in GeV and m in GeV/c², then E = γ m c² => γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV/c², then γ would be 8 / (1.2) = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, let me compute that: 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so γ is about 6.6667.

Once I have γ, I can find the velocity. The relation between γ and v is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β = v/c. So I can solve for β.

So γ = 6.6667, so 1/γ = sqrt(1 - β²). Then (1/γ)^2 = 1 - β² → β² = 1 - (1/γ²) → β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Let me compute that.

γ = 6.6667 → γ squared is (6.6667)^2. Let me calculate that: 6 *6 is 36, 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/γ squared is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887 c.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, back to the lifetime τ. I have Γ = 320 MeV. Wait, but units again. ħ is in units of GeV·s, I think. Let me recall, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s, but ħ is h/(2π), so approximately 6.582e-25 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.04e-24 GeV·s? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I remember that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Wait, let me correct that.

Actually, ħ in units of GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, but perhaps I don't need to convert into meters and seconds directly because we can handle the units through the constants.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, MeV to GeV: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → the GeV cancels out, so τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that:

6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → that's 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25. 6.582 ÷ 0.32: 0.32 × 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is 0.32 ×20.56875, so yes, 20.56875 ×1e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. But v is βc, so L = β c τ.

Let me compute that. β is approximately 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute that:

First, 0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875 ) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056875.

Let me compute that:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see, 0.9661 * 2 is 1.9322, 0.9661 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.055. So total approx 1.9872.

So total would be 4.11375 + 1.9872 ≈ 6.10095.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 2.9661 * 2.056875 → 2.056875 * 2 =4.11375, 2.056875 *0.9661.

Wait, 2.056875 * 0.9661 = 2.056875 * (1 - 0.0339) ≈ 2.056875 - 2.056875 * 0.0339.

Compute 2.056875 * 0.0339. 2 *0.0339 is 0.0678, 0.056875 *0.0339 ≈ 0.001920. So total approx 0.0697. So 2.056875 -0.0697 ≈ 1.987175.

So the total is 4.11375 + 1.987175 ≈ 6.100925.

So 6.100925e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, which is about 5e-15, and option A is 5.0223e-16 m.

Wait, that's approximately 6e-16 m, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length which uses the relativistic gamma factor.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = (γ c τ) * β, but I think that's the same as v gamma tau? Wait, no. Because L = v * t, where t is the proper lifetime τ multiplied by gamma? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is v multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait, so L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait, tau is already the proper lifetime. So L = v * gamma * tau. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau, so the distance is v multiplied by that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I should think again.

Wait, let me check another approach. Decay length is L = gamma * v * tau.

Because tau is the proper lifetime (rest frame), so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the distance is velocity (v) multiplied by gamma * tau.

So L = v * gamma * tau.

So let's compute that.

v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

We have beta c = 0.9887 c, gamma is 6.6667, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 6.6667 * c * tau.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So compute each part:

0.9887 *6.6667 ≈ approximately 6.6.

Because 6.6667 *0.9887 ≈ let's compute:

6.6667 * 0.9887 = ?

6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322.

0.6667 *0.9887 ≈ approximately 0.66 (approx 0.66 * 0.9887 is about 0.652).

So total about 5.9322 + 0.652 ≈ 6.5842.

So L ≈ 6.5842 * c * tau.

c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.5842: 6.5842 * 6.170625e-16.

Compute 6 *6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.

0.5842 * 6.170625e-16 = approx 3.607e-16.

So total is 3.702e-15 + 3.607e-16 = 4.0627e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.06e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close.

Hmm, but earlier I thought I had about 6e-16 m, but with this approach, it's about 4e-15 m. Wait, I must have messed up earlier steps.

Wait, in the first approach, I didn't include gamma correctly. Oh because when I did L = v * tau, I used tau as the proper lifetime, which gives the distance in the rest frame. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor gamma, so the actual L should be v * gamma tau, which is what I did in the second approach.

So the correct calculation should give around 4.06e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

Compute L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

beta = 0.9887, gamma = 6.6667, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So:

beta * gamma = 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈ 6.584.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 6.584 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 4.063e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but why did I get a different number earlier when I just multiplied v and tau?

Because I think I forgot to account for the time dilation. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the decay length increases by gamma. Hence, the first approach missed that, but the second approach includes it.

So the correct formula is L = beta * gamma * c * (hbar/(Gamma)).

Wait, let me recheck the formula for L.

The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

And tau is hbar/(Gamma). So putting it together:

L = gamma * beta * c * (hbar/(Gamma)).

Let me compute this step by step with precise numbers.

Compute gamma:

gamma = E/(m c^2) → E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So E/(m c²) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV/c² * c²) → the c² cancels GeV/(GeV) → 8/1.2 = 6.6666667.

So gamma is 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

So 1/gamma² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Now, calculate L = gamma * beta * c * (hbar / Gamma).

Constants:

hbar ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So:

hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = approx 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply by c: c is 3e8 m/s.

c * (hbar / Gamma) = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Now multiply by gamma * beta: 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.584.

So L = 6.584 * 6.170625e-16 m ≈ 4.063e-15 m.

Hmm, which is approximately 4.063e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So I think option B is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Here, \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the production energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the mass of the meson. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.584 \). Then:

\[
L = 6.584 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

\[
L = 6.584 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.063 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.063 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
