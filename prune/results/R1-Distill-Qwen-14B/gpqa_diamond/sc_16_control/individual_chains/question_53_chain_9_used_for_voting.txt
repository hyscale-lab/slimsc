Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm. So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring, right? The FTIR shows an ester group. Oh wait, esters have specific absorption peaks. So, the ester group would show up around 1700 cm-1, I think. That's a strong peak for the carbonyl stretch.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Wait, aromatic-H, vinyl-H, and –CH3 groups. Let me break this down. Two aromatic H signals. So, the substituents on the benzene ring must be in a position that gives two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Like maybe para substitution or something else. Wait, di-substituted rings can be in positions like para, meta, or ortho. But if it's para, then the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving one signal, right? Hmm, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe it's a meta substitution? Because in meta substitution, the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. Or maybe one substituent is bulky or electron-withdrawing, so it causes splitting. Wait, but for di-substituted, let's think about the possibilities. Let's say it's like a 1,3-disubstitution (meta) or 1,2 (ortho). If it's para, the ring would have two equivalent H's on each substituent, but wait, if both substituents are the same, then maybe it's a para di-substitution. But in this case, the aromatic signals are two, so perhaps the substituents are different. Oh wait, but the question says di-substituted. So, substituents could be, for example, an ester group and another group. 

Wait, the compound has an ester group. So, maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is something else. Let's think about the structure. Maybe the benzene ring has an ester group and another group, which is maybe a vinyl group or a methyl group. Wait, but looking at the NMR, there are two –CH3 groups. So, maybe the substituents are an ester and something that has two methyl groups, like maybe a methylene group? No, wait, the NMR shows signals for –CH3 groups, but no –CH2. So, maybe each substituent is attached with a –CH3.

Wait, let's piece this together. The substituents on the benzene ring are two groups: one is an ester, and the other is something else. Let's think about the ester group. The ester would be something like OCOOR. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group, maybe a vinyl group or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: six signals in total. Two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. So, for the aromatic H, two signals—so two different sets of aromatic H; perhaps the substituents are in a way that the ring has two different environments for the H's. Then, the vinyl H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Vinyl protons are typically split by neighboring protons. So a doublet could be from a CH2=CH group where each H is coupled to one neighboring H. But a doublet of quartets is a bit more complex. Maybe it's a coupling with two different sets of neighboring H's. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted double bond, like CH2CH2 but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe a trisubstituted or something else. Maybe the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent.

The two –CH3 groups: so each has a singlet, I guess. Since there's no –CH2 groups, perhaps each methyl is attached directly to something else. So, maybe each substituent has a methyl group. Perhaps one substituent is an ester group, OCOOR, and the other is -CH2CH2CH3 or something else. Wait, but the CH2 groups would show up in the NMR. Since there are no CH2 signals, maybe each substituent is a CH3 group attached directly.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and a methyl group? No, because then the vinyl H wouldn't be present. Wait, the vinyl H signals suggest there's a double bond somewhere. So another substituent might be a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester group, say OCOOR, where R is a CH2CH2 group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Let me think: benzene ring with an ester group (like OCOOR) and a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-). But then the vinyl Hs would be split into certain patterns.

Alternatively, maybe it's a styryl group or something similar. Wait, the vinyl Hs: one is a doublet (so maybe two neighboring Hs), and the other is a doublet of quartets (so four neighboring Hs). Hmm. Let me think about that. A doublet of quartets could be if each H is coupled to two different sets of Hs. For example, coupling with two different protons each with different multiplicities. Or maybe coupling with two protons on adjacent carbons. Wait, like in a propene system? Or perhaps a group like -CH2-CH2-CH2- but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, maybe it's a substituent like -CH2CH3 (ethyl group). But ethyl would have a triplet and a quartet. Wait, but the question says there are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's a -CH2-CH(CH3) group or something like that. Wait, maybe the substituents are such that one is a CH2CH3 and another is a methyl group. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. So, all are 6-membered rings with some substituents. Let's compute degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. Let's pick each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. So, C=11, H=14, O=2. DoU = (2*11 +2 -14 -0 )/2 = (24-14)/2 =5. Benzene ring is 3 (from the ring) + 1 double bond (if ester is present), so 3+1=4. Wait, 5 DoU. Hmm, benzene (3 DoU), ester (one double bond), so that's 4. So where's the fifth? Maybe a ring and two double bonds, or a ring and another ring.

Alternatively, for each option:

Option D: C11H12O2.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU. Benzene ring (3) + ester (1) = 4. So maybe two rings, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps another double bond. So maybe another double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR suggests there are vinyl Hs, which implies another double bond (like in a substituent). So, the substituent on the benzene ring has a double bond. So that's another DoU, making it 4 for the benzene and the substituent. Then, how about the rest.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester (like OCOOR) and another is a vinyl group. So, the structure could be something like benzene-O-CO-O-R, but wait, ester is usually R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps the ring has an ester group attached as a substituent. So, maybe the substituent is a methyl group or another group attached via ester linkage.

Alternatively, think about the substituent being a vinyl ester. Like, maybe a group like -CH2CH2-O-CO-R, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic signals are two. So, the substitution pattern on the benzene must create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. But if the substituents are different, then the ring would have two different sets of Hs. So, each substituent is at para position. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, would that lead to two different signals? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, para substitution would mean substituents at positions 1 and 4, but that would be the same as position 1 and 1 (since benzene is symmetric). Wait, no, di-substituted para would have two substituents across from each other, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs. Oh wait, no. If substituents are in para positions, then the remaining Hs would be in two equivalent positions. So, that would give one signal for the aromatic Hs. But according to the NMR, there are two signals, so that suggests that the substituents are not para. So perhaps they are meta or ortho.

Wait, let's think about the substitution. If one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group, and they are meta, then the ring would have two sets of Hs, which would give two signals. That makes sense. So, substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (meta). Then, the Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be one set, and positions 4 and 5 another. Wait, but in a meta di-substituted benzene, the Hs would be in two different environments, so two signals. That fits the NMR.

Now, the substituents: one is an ester group, the other is a vinyl group. Wait, but the NMR also shows two CH3 signals. So, perhaps the ester is an alkoxy ester. For example, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then, the other substituent is a vinyl group, maybe CH2=CH2, but that doesn't give CH3s. Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group, which would have CH2 and CH3 groups. But the NMR shows no CH2 signals, only CH3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is not a simple vinyl group but something else. Let's think about the vinyl Hs. Two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCH3. Because in that case, the CH2 would be next to the double bond, and the CH3 would be on the end. But then the NMR would show signals for CH2 and CH3. But in the problem, there are no CH2 signals, only CH3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a CH3. Like CH2=C(CH3)-. But then the substituent would be CH2C(CH3)2? Or something like that. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to an oxygen in an ester. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group O-CO-OCH3, and the other is a vinyl group. But then, the vinyl group would have its own Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group where the vinyl is attached to a methyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about the ester group. The ester would be something like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's say R is methyl. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps R is phenyl, and R' is methyl. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3? No, because that would be a carbonate group, not an ester. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, making it an ethyl ester.

Wait, maybe the di-substituted benzene has one substituent as an ester, like O-CO-CH2CH3, and another substituent as a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-. But then, the CH2 groups' Hs would appear as a triplet or something else. But in the NMR data, there are no CH2 signals, only CH3. So perhaps the substituent doesn't contain any CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group. Like CH2=CHCH2-. But again, that would involve CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. Like di-ester. So, two ester groups attached to the benzene, each with their own substituents. But that would require the benzene to have two ester groups. But then the substituents would be O-CO-R groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, perhaps each ester substituent is a methyl ester. So, each substituent is O-CO-OCH3. But wait, that would give two OCH3 groups. But then, the CH3 from OCH3 would be a singlet, perhaps. Let me think about that. If there are two OCH3 groups, each would have a singlet in the NMR. But the question says there are two signals for –CH3. So, maybe each substituent has a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent has a methyl group, not part of the ester. So, for example, the benzene has an ester group (like O-CO-CH2CH3) and a methyl group attached to the ring. But then, the ester's CH2CH3 would have a triplet (for CH2) and a triplet for CH3. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both methyl groups, but one is attached to the ester. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with the ester group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group. So, O-CO-OCH3. Then, the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Benzene ring with substituents in the meta positions: one is O-CO-OCH3 (ester group), and the other is CH2=CH2. But wait, CH2=CH2 is ethylene, which is a substituent, but in that case, the vinyl Hs would each couple with each other. So, each H would be a doublet. So, in the NMR, the vinyl Hs would be two doublets, right? But the question says one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. No, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO-O-R. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of Hs in the NMR. Let's see:

- Aromatic H: two signals. Let's say each signal has two Hs. So, four Hs in total. But wait, benzene has six Hs. Wait, but the substituents take two positions, so the ring has four Hs. So, the two signals would account for all four Hs. So, each substituent is at a position that splits the ring into two sets of two Hs each. Like meta substitution.

Wait, but in a meta di-substituted benzene ring, the Hs are in two sets of two each, and one pair is equivalent. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. For a meta di-substituted benzene, the structure is such that substituents are at positions 1 and 3. So, the Hs at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (a set of two Hs), and the Hs at positions 4 and 5 are another set of two Hs. So, two signals for aromatic Hs, each integrating for two Hs. That fits with the NMR data.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3. One substituent is an ester group, O-CO-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, maybe CH2=CH- something. Wait, but the substituent could be a vinyl group attached to something else.

Now, the NMR has two CH3 signals. So, wherever there are CH3 groups, they must be split into two signals. So perhaps the substituent has two methyl groups, each attached to different parts. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propenyl group. Like CH2=CHCH3. So, the substituent is CH2=CHCH3 attached to the benzene ring. But then, the CH2 would be next to the double bond, and the CH3 at the end. The vinyl Hs would be on the CH2 and the CH3. Wait, but then the CH2 would split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methylene group attached to an ester. Wait, like O-CO-OCH2CH3. But then, the CH2 would have Hs that would show up as a quartet. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring and another group. But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options are four compounds: C11H14O2, C11H12O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Each is a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester and some substituents.

What's the molecular formula? Let's think about how the substituents contribute to the formula.

The benzene ring is C6H6. Each substituent adds some groups. Let's assume each substituent contributes R groups.

Since it's di-substituted, the formula would be C6H6 - 2H + 2*(substituent formula). Because each substituent replaces a H.

Wait, each substituent is an ester group and another group. So, for example, if one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 and the other is CH2=CH2, let's see.

Wait, O-CO-OCH3 is the ester group (like methyl carbonate). No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, if R is phenyl and R' is methyl, then the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3. So, that's a methoxycarbonyl group. Its formula is O-CO-OCH3, which is C2H3O2. Wait, wait, O-CO-OCH3 is O-CO-OCH3. The formula is (each O is O), so the group is O=C(OCH3). So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is C2H3O2. So, each substituent adds (C2H3O2) minus the H it replaces on the benzene. Hmm, no, each substituent replaces a H, so the formula becomes C6H6 - 2H + 2*(substituent formula).

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the molecular formula.

The overall formula is the benzene (C6H6) plus the substituents.

Each substituent is, say, an ester group.

Let me think about the substituents. Suppose one substituent is -O-CO-OCH3 (methoxycarbonyl), and another substituent is -CH2CH3 (ethyl). But that would give a formula:

C6H6 - 2H (because two substituents) + [O-CO-OCH3 (which is C2H3O2) + CH2CH3 (which is C2H5)].

Wait, wait, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3: that's (O)CO(OCH3). The formula would be C2H3O2.

Substituent 2: CH2CH3: that's C2H5.

So, the total added from substituents: C2 + C2 = C4, H3 + H5 = H8, O2.

So, benzene is C6H6.

Total formula: C6 + C4 = C10, H6-2 (because two Hs replaced) + H8 = H12, O2.

So, formula is C10H12O2. But none of the options match that. So perhaps that's not the correct structure.

Hmm, maybe the substituents are different. Let's try substituents as O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) and another group.

O-CO-OCH2CH3 is the substituent: that's C3H5O2.

Another substituent could be CH3 (methyl). So substituent 2: CH3.

So, total substituent formula: C3 + C1 = C4, H5 + H3 = H8, O2.

Benzene is C6H6. So, adding substituents: C6 + C4 = C10. H6-2 + H8 = H12. O2.

Again, C10H12O2. Still not matching any options.

Wait, the options are C11, C12, etc. So maybe the substituents are larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-CH2CH2OCH3 or something, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The options are:

A) C11H14O2
B) C12H14O2
C) C12H12O2
D) C11H12O2

So, the molecular formula has either 11 or 12 carbons, 12 or 14 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.

If the benzene ring has two substituents, each substituent must contribute (n) carbons. Let's see:

For option D: C11H12O2.

Benzene is 6 C. So substituents contribute 5 C in total. So each substituent contributes about 2.5 C, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Wait, but substituents are two, so perhaps substituent1 is 3 C, substituent2 is 2 C. Summing to 5 C. So, possible.

Let's see, substituent1: maybe O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which is 3 C (O-CO-OCH2CH3: O connected to CO, which is connected to OCH2CH3. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is (COOCH2CH3). So, that's 3 carbons (the COO is two O's, but for carbons, it's three: the COO from the ester is part of the substituent. Wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is part of the ester group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is (O-CO-O-) connected to CH2CH3. So, the substituent contributes 3 carbons (the COO and the two from CH2CH3). Wait, no. The substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So, that's O, C, O, C, O, CH2CH3. So, in terms of carbons, the substituent is O(CO)OCH2CH3, which has 3 carbons (the carbonyl C, the OCH2CH3 has two Cs). So, substituent1 is 3 C.

Substituent2: perhaps a methyl group (CH3). So, substituent2 is 1 C. But that only adds up to 4 C, and the benzene is 6 C. 6 +4=10 C. But the option D is C11H12O2. So, 11 C. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). That would be 4 C in substituent1 (COO and three from propyl). Substituent2: CH3. So substituent1: 3 C (COO) + 3 (propyl) = 6 C? No, wait, substituent1 would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which is three carbons in the ester part (COO) plus three from propyl? No, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is propyl. So, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which is four C (COO and three from propyl). So, substituent1: 4 C.

Substituent2: maybe a vinyl group with a methyl attached. Like CH2=CHCH3. That's three C. So, substituent2 is 3 C.

So, substituent1:4 C, substituent2:3 C. Total substituent C:7. Benzene is 6 C. So, total C:6+7=13. But the options don't go that high. So, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, substituent1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), which is 2 C (COO and CH3). Substituent2 is CH2=CH2 (ethylene), which is 2 C. So, substituent C:2+2=4. Benzene:6. Total:10 C. But the options have 11 or 12. Hmm.

Wait, maybe substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (3 C), substituent2 is CH2=CHCH3 (3 C). So substituent C: 3 +3=6. Benzene:6. Total C:12.

So, formula would be C12 + H and O.

Wait, substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So, that's substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. The formula for substituent1 is (COOCH2CH2CH3). So, substituent1 has 3 (COO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) = 6 C? No, wait, the COO is part of the substituent, so substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So, that's 3 C in the COO part (O-CO-O), and 3 C in the propyl group (CH2CH2CH3). So, substituent1 is 6 C? Or no, the COO is two O's but the carbons are from the ester group. So, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3: that's 3 C (COO) + 3 C (propyl) = 6 C.

Wait, perhaps I should count the substituents as part of the ring.

Wait, each substituent is attached to the benzene, so each substituent adds their own formula. So, for substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3.

So, substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3.

Each O is O, but in terms of C and H:

O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 = O=C(O-O-CH2CH2CH3). So, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which is C3H6O2 (since COO has two O, and the propyl has 3 C and 7 H? Wait, perhaps better to compute the formula:

O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 is:

Carbon: 1 (C=O) + 2 (COO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) = 6 C?

Wait, no. Let's break it down:

The substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

So, the carbonyl is one C, the two O's in COO are part of the ester, and then the O-CH2CH2CH3 is the R group. So, substituent1 contributes:

C: 1 (COO) + 3 (propyl) = 4 C.

H: Let's see, the propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H. But in the substituent, O-CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H. But wait, the substituent is part of the ester, so it's O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So, that group has:

COO: which is (O=C-O-). The O is connected to the propyl group. So, the substituent has 4 C (COO has two C, the O is part of the linking, and the propyl contributes 3 C). So substituent1: 4 C.

Hydrogens: the propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H. But the O is connected to the CH2, so maybe the substituent has 7 H from the propyl. The COO group doesn't add any H.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the formula.

Benzene is C6H6.

Each substituent is:

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So, that's:

O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

Which is:

COO (which is O=C-O-) plus the propyl group.

The formula of substituent1: C (from COO) is 2 (C=O and O-C-O), and the propyl is 3 C. So total C: 5? Because the COO has two C, and the propyl has three C. Wait, no. O-CO-O is O-C-O-C-O? No, the structure is O-CO-O-R, where R is propyl. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So, the COO part is two O's, and the carbonyl C. So, substituent1 has:

C: 3 (COO: 2 C and the O connects to the propyl which is 3 C. Wait, no. Wait, O is connected to the COO group. So, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. That's:

COO has two C: the carbonyl C and the oxygen-linked C. The propyl is three C. So, substituent1 is 2 +3 =5 C.

Hydrogens: the propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H. So, substituent1 contributes 7 H.

Substituent2: Let's say it's a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. So, substituent2 is CH2=CHCH3. That's 3 C and 5 H (CH2=CHCH3 has 3 C and 5 H: the double bond CH2 has two H, CH has one H, and CH3 has three H. Total: 2 +1 +3 =6 H. Wait, no: CH2=CHCH3 structure is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the first and second C. So, it's CH2=CHCH3. So, the first CH2 has two H, the second CH has one H (since it's double bonded), and the third CH3 has three H. So, total H: 2 +1 +3 =6.

So, substituent2 contributes 3 C and 6 H.

Now, putting it all together.

Benzene: C6H6.

Substituent1: 5 C, 7 H, O2.

Substituent2: 3 C, 6 H.

Total formula:

C:6 +5 +3 =14. But wait, that's more than the options. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are smaller. Let's think: substituent1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and substituent2 is CH2=CH2 (ethylene). So substituent1: O-CO-OCH3. That's 3 C (COO and CH3). Substituent2: CH2=CH2: 2 C.

So substituent1: 3 C, substituent2: 2 C. Total substituent C:5. Benzene:6. Total C:11.

Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H, but each substituent replaces a H, so 6 -2 =4 H. Substituent1: O-CO-OCH3 has 3 H (from CH3). Substituent2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H, but in a double bond, the Hs are each on separate CH2 groups. Wait, CH2=CH2 has two CH2 groups, each with 2 H, so 4 H total.

So, total H: 4 (from benzene) + 3 (from substituent1) +4 (from substituent2) = 11 H.

O: substituent1 has two O (COO) and substituent2 has none. So O2.

So the formula would be C11H11O2. But none of the options match that exactly. The closest is D) C11H12O2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting H.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces one H. So, 6 -2 =4 H on the ring. Substituent1: O-CO-OCH3 has 3 H (from CH3). Substituent2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H, but in the substituent, it's a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH2; each CH2 has 2 H, but in the structure, each H is attached to a CH2 group, so 4 H in substituent2.

So, total H: 4 +3 +4 =11. So the formula is C11H11O2. But the options have H12, H14, etc. So perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Hmm, another approach: considering the degrees of unsaturation.

For option D: C11H12O2.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So, 6 degrees of unsaturation. Benzene ring is 3 (from the ring), ester is 1 (from the carbonyl), and the substituent would contribute 2 more (another ring or another double bond). But that doesn't fit with the NMR data, which shows a vinyl group (double bond).

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has a double bond, adding another degree. So, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (another ring or double bond) =6.

But the NMR doesn't show any other rings, just the aromatic and vinyl. So perhaps the substituent has a double bond, but not a ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group (one double bond) and part of the ester contributes another. So, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) =5. But the DoU is 6. So, something's missing.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a ring in the substituent. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has a ring. Like a cyclopropane or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group, and another double bond somewhere, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR again.

The NMR has six signals:

- Two aromatic H (each a pair of H)
- Two vinyl H (doublet and doublet of quartets)
- Two CH3 groups (each a singlet)

So, the substituents must have CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and an ester group. But then, the vinyl Hs would be from another substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group, each attached to the benzene ring. Let's say substituent1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), substituent2 is CH2=CH2 (ethylene).

So, substituent1: O-CO-OCH3 contributes 3 C, substituent2: CH2=CH2 contributes 2 C. So total substituent C:5. Benzene:6. So, 11 C. So, formula would be C11H12O2? Let me compute.

Benzene: C6H6.

Each substituent replaces one H. So 6-2=4 H on ring.

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH3 has 3 H (from CH3).

Substituent2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H.

Total H:4 +3 +4=11. So, C11H11O2. Doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, maybe substituent2 is a CH2=CHCH3. So substituent2 has 3 C and 5 H (CH2=CHCH3: each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H. Wait, no: the structure is CH2=CHCH3. So, CH2=CHCH3 has 3 C and 5 H: CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H. Total 2+1+3=6 H.

So, substituent2: 3 C, 6 H.

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH3: 3 C, 3 H.

So, total substituent C: 3+3=6. Benzene:6. Total C:12. So, formula would be C12H (6-2) +3 +6 = H13. O2.

So, formula is C12H13O2. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting Hs.

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so 6-2 =4 H.

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH3: has 3 H (CH3).

Substituent2: CH2=CHCH3: has 6 H.

So, total H:4 +3 +6=13. So, C12H13O2. No option matches.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the molecular formula of each option and what substituents would lead to that.

Option D: C11H12O2.

Benzene is C6H6.

So substituents contribute 5 C and 6 H.

Each substituent would contribute, in total, 5 C and 6 H.

If both substituents are methyl groups, each substituent would contribute 1 C and 3 H. But that's 2 C and 6 H. So, 2 C from substituents, 6 from benzene: 8 C. But option D has 11 C. So that's not it.

Alternatively, substituents are an ester group and another group.

Suppose substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which is 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) =5 C. Substituent2 is a methyl group (1 C). So, substituent1:5 C, substituent2:1 C. Total substituent C:6. Benzene:6. So total C:12. Which is option B or C.

Wait, but option D is C11H12O2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C) and substituent2 is CH2=CH2 (2 C). So, substituent C:5. Benzene:6. Total C:11. That fits option D (C11H12O2).

So, let's compute H:

Benzene:6 H.

Each substituent replaces one H: 6-2=4.

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH3 has 3 H (CH3).

Substituent2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H.

Total H:4 +3 +4=11.

So, formula is C11H11O2. But option D is C11H12O2. So, one more H somewhere.

Ah, wait, perhaps the substituent2 is CH2=CHCH3. So, substituent2 has 3 C and 6 H. Substituent1:3 C, 3 H. Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12. Which is option B or C.

Hmm, but we're stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ester, and another substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl. Wait, maybe the structure is benzene with an ester group (O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3) and a vinyl group (CH2=CHCH3).

So, substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (5 C: COO (2 C) + CH2CH2CH3 (3 C)).

Substituent2: CH2=CHCH3 (3 C).

So, substituent1:5 C, substituent2:3 C. Total substituent C:8. Benzene:6. Total C:14. Not matching any options.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, perhaps each substituent has a CH3 group.

So, substituent1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) → contributes one CH3.

Substituent2: something else with a CH3.

Like, substituent2 could be CH2CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group. But then, the substituent would have CH2 and CH3, which would show up in the NMR as a triplet and a quartet or something else. But the NMR data shows no CH2 signals, only CH3. So, substituent2 can't have any CH2 groups. So, substituent2 must be a methyl group attached in a way that doesn't involve any CH2.

Wait, maybe substituent2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. But that has a CH2, which would show up as a quartet. But the NMR says no CH2 signals, only CH3. So, that can't be right.

Alternatively, substituent2 is a methyl group attached directly to the ring. So, substituent2 is -CH3. Then, substituent1 is an ester group.

So, substituent1: O-CO-R. Let's say R is CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), so substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (3 C: COO and ethyl). Substituent2: CH3 (1 C).

So, substituent1:3 C, substituent2:1 C. Total substituent C:4. Benzene:6. Total C:10. But the options start at C11. So, no match.

Alternatively, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (4 C: COO and propyl). Substituent2: CH3 (1 C). Total substituent C:5. Benzene:6. Total C:11. So, formula would be C11.

Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H, minus 2 for substituents → 4.

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 has 3 H (from CH3) in the propyl group. But wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which has a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, that's 7 H in the propyl group (CH2 has 2 H, CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H: 2+2+3 =7 H).

Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So, the propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H. But when attached to the O, perhaps the Hs are split differently. So substituent1 contributes 7 H.

Substituent2: CH3 → 3 H.

So, total H:4 +7 +3 =14.

Oxygens: substituent1 has 2 O, substituent2 has none.

So, formula is C11H14O2. Which is option A.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two CH3 signals. So substituent1's CH3 (from propyl) and substituent2's CH3. So, two CH3 signals in the NMR. That fits.

Now, the substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester (wait, no, propyl). So, the substituent would have a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to O.

The NMR would show the vinyl Hs as well. So, substituent2 is CH3, which doesn't have any vinyl Hs. So where are the vinyl Hs coming from?

Ah, perhaps substituent1 has a vinyl group. Wait, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. That's an ester with a propyl group. But no double bond. So, the vinyl Hs must come from another substituent.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe substituent1 is a vinyl ester. Like, substituent1 is CH2=CHCOO-O-R.

Wait, but that would add more C and H. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent2 is a vinyl group. Wait, substituent2 is CH3, so no. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent structure.

Alternatively, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. So, substituent1 would have a double bond in the substituent.

In that case, substituent1 would contribute a vinyl group. So, the substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. So, that's 5 C: COO (2 C) + CH2CH=CH2 (3 C).

So, substituent1:5 C. Substituent2: CH3 (1 C). Total substituent C:6. Benzene:6. So, total C:12. So, formula is C12.

Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so 4 H left.

Substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2.

The CH2CH=CH2 group has 5 H: CH2 (2 H), CH (1 H), CH2 (2 H). So, substituent1 has 5 H.

Substituent2: CH3 → 3 H.

Total H:4 +5 +3=12. So, C12H12O2. Which is option C.

Now, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic H: two signals, each two H → two signals (likely two doublets or something else, but the data says two signals, each for aromatic H).

- Vinyl Hs: substituent1's CH2CH=CH2 group would have CH2 next to the double bond and CH next to that. The CH2 would split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH, which is split by the CH2. Wait, but in the substituent, the structure is CH2-CH=CH2. So the CH2 is adjacent to the double bond, and the CH is part of the double bond.

So, the CH2 group would be a quartet (coupled with the CH), and the CH would be a doublet (coupled with both adjacent CH2 groups). But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps the CH2 is split into a doublet of quartets, and the CH is a doublet. So, substituent1's CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH would be a doublet.

Wait, substituent1: structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

The CH2 group is attached to O, and next to a CH=CH2.

So, the CH2 would be a quartet? Or perhaps a doublet of quartets. Because it's adjacent to a CH that's part of a double bond, which might be coupled with two different Hs.

Alternatively, the CH2 group would be adjacent to the CH that's part of the double bond. So, each H in CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH. But CH is part of a double bond, so it's actually a CH2 group as well? No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the splitting.

In the substituent O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 is next to a CH=CH2 group. So, the CH2 group (let's call it CH2a) is attached to the ester oxygen. The next group is CH2b, which is double-bonded to CH2c.

So, the structure is:

O-CO-O-CH2a-CH2b=CH2c.

Wait, no. The structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the ester oxygen is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH group (from CH=CH2).

So, the CH2a (next to O) is attached to CHb, which is part of a double bond (CH=CH2).

So, the CH2a group would have each H coupling with the Hs on CHb. But CHb is part of a double bond, so it's a CH group which has two Hs? No, CH is a single H. Wait, CH=CH2 is actually CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. So, the structure is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two middle C's. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Wait, that's not correct. Let me clarify.

The substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the middle two CH2 groups. So, structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the second and third C. So, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 is not right. It should be O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the CH2 group is attached to the O, then a CH group (double bonded to another CH2).

So, the structure is:

O

|
CO-O-

CH2-CH=CH2.

So, the CH2 group (CH2a) is attached to the O. The next group is CH (CHb), which is double-bonded to CH2 (CHc).

Now, the CH2a group: each H in CH2a would couple with the H(s) on CHb. Since CHb is part of a double bond, it's a CH group with one H. So, each H in CH2a would couple with the single H on CHb. So, each H in CH2a would see one neighboring H, leading to a doublet.

But wait, the CH2a group has two Hs. So, each H would be a doublet, and the CH2a would have a triplet (if coupling with two Hs) but in this case, each H is coupled to one H. So, the CH2a would be a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coupling constants. The CH2a group is next to the CHb group, which has one H. So, each H in CH2a is coupled with the H in CHb.

So, the CH2a group would be a triplet because each H is coupled with two Hs from the CHb group? No, wait, CHb has only one H. So, each H in CH2a would be a doublet, because each is coupled with one H.

But because the CH2a has two Hs, each of which is coupled with the same H, the CH2a group would be a triplet? No, wait, the CH2a is a single group; each H is split by the same neighboring H. So, each H in CH2a would be a doublet. But since the CH2a group has two Hs, they would be a doublet of doublets? No, that's for two different coupling partners. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the CH2a group would be split into a triplet because each H is coupled with two Hs (the two Hs on the adjacent CHb group). But CHb is a single H. So, each H in CH2a is coupled with one H, leading to a doublet.

But both Hs in CH2a are equivalent, so the signal would be a doublet. Hmm.

The CHb group is part of a double bond, so it's a CH group. The H on CHb would be coupled with the Hs on CH2a and the Hs on CHc (if any). Wait, CHc is a CH2 group, which has two Hs.

So, the CHb H is coupled with two Hs from CH2a and two Hs from CHc. So, that's four Hs. So, the CHb H would be a quintet? Or perhaps a doublet of quartets.

Similarly, the CHc group (CH2) is next to CHb, so each H in CHc would be coupled with the H on CHb. So, each H in CHc would be a doublet.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the CHb H is the one that's a doublet of quartets (coupled with four Hs), and the CH2a and CHc Hs are the doublets.

So, in this structure, the substituent1 (O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2) would have:

- CH2a: each H is a doublet (coupled with CHb's H).
- CHb: each H is a doublet of quartets (coupled with CH2a's two Hs and CHc's two Hs).
- CHc: each H is a doublet (coupled with CHb's H).

So, the NMR would show three vinyl H signals. But the question says two vinyl H signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps this structure doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps substituent1 isn't a vinyl group but another group. I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the options. The correct answer must be one of the four options, so perhaps I can figure it out by elimination.

The FTIR shows an ester, so the compound has an ester group. The NMR shows two CH3 groups, two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals, and no CH2.

So, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group and a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. No, that would involve CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group, and another substituent that's a vinyl group attached to another methyl. But that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a propenyl group. Like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. But that would involve CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ester, and another substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl on the other end, like CH2=CHCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group, but that doesn't account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent that includes a vinyl group.

Like, substituent1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, substituent1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and the NMR data.

The correct formula must have:

Number of Hs: aromatic (4), vinyl (4), CH3 (6) → 4 +4 +6 =14 H. But looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 → 12 H.

Option B: C12H14O2 →14 H.

Option C: C12H12O2 →12 H.

Wait, wait. The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic H (each with two H → total 4), two vinyl H (each with two H → total 4?), and two CH3 (each with three H → total 6). So total H would be 4+4+6=14? But that would mean the molecular formula has 14 H. So, options A and B have 14 H.

But wait, the benzene ring has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H. So, substituent1 and substituent2 each take one H. So, 6 -2 =4 H left on the ring.

So, the substituent1 and substituent2 contribute their own H.

If substituent1 is an ester (O-CO-O-R) and substituent2 is a vinyl group with CH3, perhaps the total H would add up to 14.

Looking at the options, A is C11H14O2. So, 11 C, 14 H, 2 O.

So, let's compute:

Assuming substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester: 3 C, 5 H). Substituent2 is CH2=CHCH3 (3 C, 6 H). Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12. Option B is C12H14O2. So formula would be C12H14O2.

But wait, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (3 C, 5 H), substituent2 is CH2=CHCH3 (3 C,6 H). So, substituent1:5 H, substituent2:6 H. Benzene H:4. Total H:4 +5 +6=15. Which is more than option B's 14 H. So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps substituent2 is CH2=CH2 (2 C,4 H). Substituent1: O-CO-OCH2CH3 (3 C,5 H). So substituent1:5 H, substituent2:4 H. Benzene:4 H. Total H:13. Doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C,3 H) and substituent2 is CH2=CHCH3 (3 C,6 H). So substituent1:3 H, substituent2:6 H. Benzene:4 H. Total:13 H. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (4 C,7 H) and substituent2 is CH3 (1 C,3 H). So substituent1:7 H, substituent2:3 H. Benzene:4 H. Total H:14.

So, substituent1:4 C, substituent2:1 C. Benzene:6 C. Total C:11.

So, formula is C11H14O2. Which is option A.

That would fit:

- Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

- Substituent1:4 C (O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 is 3 C for COO and 3 for the propyl? Wait, no. O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 has 3 C in COO and 3 in propyl, but I'm not sure about the exact count.

Wait, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3: the COO is two C (O-C-O), and the propyl is three C. So substituent1 has 3 +3=6 C? No, O-CO-O is one C (the carbonyl C) and two O's. Wait, no, O-CO-O is O connected to C, connected to O. So, substituent1: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So, the COO part is two C (O-C-O), and the propyl is three C. So substituent1 is 2 +3=5 C.

Substituent2: CH3 →1 C.

Total C:6 (benzene) +5 +1=12 C. So, C12H14O2. Which is option B.

But earlier, the H count was 4 (benzene) +7 (substituent1: propyl) +3 (substituent2: CH3) =14 H. So, H14.

So, formula is C12H14O2, option B.

But earlier, I thought substituent1 was O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (5 C), substituent2 CH3 (1 C). So, substituent1:5 C, substituent2:1 C. Total C:6+5+1=12.

H:4 +7 +3=14.

So, formula is C12H14O2. Option B.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So substituent1 has a CH3 (from propyl group) and substituent2 has a CH3. So, two CH3 groups, which matches the NMR.

The aromatic Hs: two signals, each two H →4 H.

Vinyl Hs: substituent1 has a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to O. Wait, no, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So, that's a propyl group attached to O. No double bond. So, where are the vinyl Hs coming from?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake. Substituent1 must have a double bond as well. So, substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, substituent1 has a propenyl group.

In that case, substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, substituent1 contributes 5 C (COO is two C, propenyl is three C).

Substituent2: CH3 →1 C.

Total C:6+5+1=12. So, C12H14O2. Option B.

Hydrogens:

Benzene:4 H.

Substituent1: CH2-CH=CH2 group has 5 H (CH2:2 H, CH:1 H, CH2:2 H → total 5 H).

Substituent2: CH3 →3 H.

Total H:4+5+3=12. But option B is H14. So, missing 2 H.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester). So, substituent1 has 4 C (COO and butyl). Substituent2: CH3. So, substituent1:4 C, substituent2:1 C. Total C:6+4+1=11. H:

Substituent1: O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → the butyl group has 9 H (each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H. 3 CH2 groups: 2*3=6, plus CH3:3 → total 9 H).

Substituent2: CH3 →3 H.

Benzene:4 H.

Total H:4+9+3=16. But option A is H14. So, doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck again. Maybe I should look at the degrees of unsaturation. Option B is C12H14O2.

DoU: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

Benzene:3 DoU.

Ester:1 DoU.

Substituent1: perhaps a double bond (vinyl group) → 1 DoU.

Total:3+1+1+1=6. So that fits.

So, substituent1 is a vinyl group, substituent2 is a methyl group.

So, substituent1: CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent1 is CH2=CHCH3 (vinyl group with methyl). But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, but the NMR has no CH2 signals. So, substituent1 can't have CH2 groups. So, maybe substituent1 is a methyl group attached to the ester, and substituent2 is a vinyl group without any CH2.

But I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester), which has a CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't show any. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is really tricky. Maybe the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, for option D: C11H12O2.

DoU=6.

Benzene:3.

Ester:1.

Substituent1: a vinyl group (1). So, total 5, need another DoU. Maybe a ring in the substituent. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the substituent has another double bond.

But without more information, it's hard.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR data, the presence of two CH3 groups, and the ester, the molecular formula that fits is C11H14O2 (option A) or C12H14O2 (option B).

Wait, substituent1 as O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (5 C, 7 H), substituent2 as CH3 (1 C, 3 H). Benzene:6 C, 4 H. Total C:6+5+1=12. H:4+7+3=14. So, formula C12H14O2, option B.

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So, substituent must have a vinyl group, which would have a double bond, contributing another DoU.

But in this structure, substituent1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, no double bond.

Ah, so perhaps I'm wrong, and substituent1 has a double bond. So, substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So, substituent1:5 C, 5 H (CH2:2 H, CH:1 H, CH2:2 H). Substituent2: CH3:3 H.

Benzene:4 H.

Total H:4 +5 +3=12.

Total C:6 +5 +1=12.

So, formula C12H12O2. Which is option C.

But the option C has H12. So, that would fit.

Now, checking the NMR data:

- Aromatic H: two signals →4 H.

- Vinyl H: substituent1's CH2-CH=CH2 → CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with CH), and CH would be a doublet. But the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the CH is a doublet of quartets (coupled with four Hs?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH), and the CH would be a triplet (coupled with CH2 and adjacent Hs). Not sure.

But, the substituent1 would have two vinyl H signals.

So, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic H: two signals.

- Vinyl H: two signals (CH2 and CH).

- CH3: two signals (from substituent1's CH2CH=CH2 and substituent2's CH3).

Wait, substituent1's CH2CH=CH2 would have CH3? No, substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, no CH3 in substituent1. Substituent2 is CH3 → one CH3.

So, the NMR would have only one CH3 signal, but the question says two. So, that can't be.

Wait, substituent1 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which has a CH3? No. So, substituent1 has no CH3. Substituent2 is CH3 → one CH3.

So, the NMR shows two CH3 signals, but substituent2 only contributes one. So, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group (O-CO-O) means that the formula must include that. So, the ester contributes two O and two C (the COO part). Each substituent would add their own groups.

If the compound is an ester with two substituents, one being a methyl group and the other a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is phenyl acetate with a vinyl group.

Ph-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 and a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl ester and a vinyl group.

But without more info, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the NMR data, the formula that fits the number of H is option A or B. Given the substituents, I'll go with option D: C11H12O2.

The question involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and $^1$H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, while the $^1$H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl protons. There are no signals corresponding to methylene ($-CH_2$) groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group is confirmed by the strong absorption peak around 1700 cm$^{-1}$, characteristic of a carbonyl group in esters.

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:
   - **Two aromatic protons**: This suggests a di-substituted benzene ring with two distinct environments for the aromatic protons, likely due to a meta substitution pattern.
   - **Two vinyl protons**: The splitting patterns (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling interactions.
   - **Two methyl protons**: The absence of methylene signals suggests that all methyl groups are directly attached to the structure without intervening $-CH_2$ groups.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A: C$_{11}$H$_{14}$O$_2$**
   - **Option B: C$_{12}$H$_{14}$O$_2$**
   - **Option C: C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$**
   - **Option D: C$_{11}$H$_{12}$O$_2$**

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - For **Option A (C$_{11}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**:  
     $$ \text{DoU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 14}{2} = 6 $$  
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving 1 additional DoU, which could be satisfied by a double bond or ring.
   - For **Option B (C$_{12}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**:  
     $$ \text{DoU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 14}{2} = 6 $$  
     Similar to Option A, the benzene ring, ester, and vinyl group account for 5 DoU, leaving 1 additional DoU.
   - For **Option C (C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**:  
     $$ \text{DoU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 12}{2} = 7 $$  
     The benzene ring, ester, and vinyl group account for 5 DoU, leaving 2 additional DoU, which could indicate an additional double bond or ring.
   - For **Option D (C$_{11}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**:  
     $$ \text{DoU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 12}{2} = 6 $$  
     Similar to Options A and B, the benzene ring, ester, and vinyl group account for 5 DoU, leaving 1 additional DoU.

5. **Structure Consideration**:
   - The compound is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group. The ester group contributes to the molecular formula as $-O-CO-O-R$, and the vinyl group contributes $-CH=CH-$. The absence of $-CH_2$ signals in the NMR suggests that all methyl groups are directly attached to the structure.
   - For **Option A (C$_{11}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**: This formula matches a structure where the benzene ring has an ester group (e.g., $-O-CO-OCH_3$) and a vinyl group ($-CH=CH-CH_3$), with no additional rings or double bonds.
   - For **Option B (C$_{12}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)**: This formula corresponds to a larger ester group (e.g., $-O-CO-OCH_2CH_2CH_3$) and a vinyl group ($-CH=CH-CH_3$), with no additional rings or double bonds.
   - For **Option C (C$_{12}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**: This formula suggests a structure with an additional double bond or ring, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.
   - For **Option D (C$_{11}$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**: This formula matches a structure with a smaller ester group (e.g., $-O-CO-OCH_3$) and a vinyl group ($-CH=CH-CH_3$), with no additional double bonds or rings.

### Conclusion:
Based on the NMR data, the absence of $-CH_2$ signals, and the molecular formula analysis, **Option A (C$_{11}$H$_{14}$O$_2$)** is the most consistent with the given data. It accounts for the ester group, the vinyl group, and the two methyl groups without requiring additional double bonds or rings.
