Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atomic energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. Right, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, wait—wait, the specific energy levels are considered. So the ratio of excitation is given. Oh, the excitation is higher in star_1, so I think the ratio of the populations would be n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the population in star_1's level is twice that of star_2's level? Or is it the other way around? Let me read again.

Ah, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is higher. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, the excitation is higher, so maybe the population in the higher energy level is higher in star_1. So the ratio depends on the energy levels.

Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, that's a specific value. I think that's the delta E between the two energy levels in question.

So the Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Since the energy levels are different, the exponent would involve the temperature.

In this problem, I think the energy difference is E = E_i - E_j (assuming the higher energy level is i). So, since star_1 has higher excitation, perhaps the higher energy level has a higher population there.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem states that the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. So, the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

The ratio of the populations of the upper level (n_upper) to the lower level (n_lower) is given by:

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both levels (since for many atoms, the ground state has g=1, but sometimes higher levels have higher g. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps it's safe to assume g_upper/g_lower = 1? Or wait, maybe they're the same.

Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Let me see, 1.38 is about k (Boltzmann's constant) which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's exactly the value of k, so 1.38e-23 J equals k*T where T is 1 K. So ΔE = k*T when T is 1 K.

Hmm, interesting. So let's see. The ratio of the populations between the two stars would relate to their temperatures.

Given that in star 1, the excitation is higher, so the population in the upper level is higher than in the lower level. So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 (since it's twice as excited as star_2? Or wait, no, the question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps the ratio between the two stars is 2:1.

Wait, the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So their excitation level is twice as high. So the number of atoms in the upper level (excited state) in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, but the energy levels are the same, but each star's level has a different population. So for each star, their respective n_upper / n_lower depends on their T.

So, for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = same expression, but with T2.

But the question says that for a specific energy level, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excitation of star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. So maybe n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Wait no, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So perhaps the population in star_1's upper level compared to star_2's upper level is twice. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the upper level to the lower level in each star, and star_1's ratio is twice star_2's. Hmm, that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the excitation potential is twice as high? No, no, the energy difference is given.

Wait, perhaps I should model it this way. Let's denote for each star:

For star 1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is such that n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Wait, perhaps the ratio is that the population in the upper level of star_1 is twice that of the upper level of star_2, but I'm not sure. The question isn't entirely clear. Wait, it's about the excitation in a specific energy level.

Oh wait, no. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So for the same energy level, the population is higher. So for star_1, the number of atoms in that level is twice that of star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2, where n is the number density in that specific level.

Wait, no, because the specific energy level is the same for both, but each star's photosphere has a different temperature, so the population in that level depends on T.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the population in the upper level of star_1 is twice that of star_2's upper level. So n1_upper = 2 n2_upper.

But wait, the same energy level is being considered. So each star's upper level (for that specific ΔE) is being compared.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the excitation level for star_1 is such that the population in the upper level is twice that of the lower level in star_2. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is that (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower). Because star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is twice the ratio of n2_upper/n2_lower.

Wait, let me think. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So:

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

But using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is:

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE / (k T) )

Assuming that g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, since they are the same element and same energy levels, then:

n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

And according to the problem, the ratio for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So:

exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait, no. Because the problem says that star_1's ratio is twice as high as star_2's. So:

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

So substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

Wait, but ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So:

1 K [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) * 1 K

But wait, no. Wait, 1 K multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2). Let me make sure.

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) * 1 K^{-1} ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute:

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * T, where T is 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So, substituting back, we have:

1 K * [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Dividing both sides by K:

[ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2) / K ?

Wait, no. Wait, the left side is [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] and the right side is (ΔE/(k)) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

(ΔE)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But since ΔE/k is 1 K, so:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Dividing both sides by K:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / K ?

Wait, no, K is in J/(mol*K), but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me not get stuck on units but focus on the equation.

So, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k)) )

But since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, then:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1 K) )

Wait, no, because (ΔE/(k)) ) is 1 K, so (ΔE/(k)) )*(1/T2 - 1/T1) )= ln(2).

So, (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k)) )

But since ΔE/(k) =1 K, this becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) / 1 K

Which is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) )

Wait, but K is in units of Kelvin. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, let's factor out the 1/(k) from the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation again.

We have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

As before.

We know ΔE/(k) = 1 K, so:

1 K [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / 1 K

Which is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1 K)^{-1}

But 1 K^-1 is just 1/K, so:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / K

Wait, but K is 1 K, so 1/K is 1. So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, that can't be right because the units would be 1/K on the left and unitless on the right. Hmm, I must be messing up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express everything in terms of units that match.

Wait, Boltzmann's equation is unitless because the exponent must be dimensionless. So ΔE/(k T) must be unitless.

So, when I have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranged:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Because:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Since ΔE/(k) = 1 K, as earlier:

(1 K) * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So,

[ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2) / (1 K )

Which is,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1})

So, the equation becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / K

But wait, K is 1 K. So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But K is 1 K, so 1 K^{-1} is 1 per Kelvin.

Wait, perhaps the units are getting me stuck. Let me instead write the equation without units.

We have:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k)) )

But ΔE/(k) is 1 K, so:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) * [1/(1 K) ] )

Which is,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) / (1 K )

Hmm, but K is a unit of temperature, so 1 K is 1 Kelvin.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way:

The equation is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1 K) ) / (1 K )

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed algebraically.

Let me rearrange the equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k))

But ΔE/(k)=1 K, so this becomes:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) / (1 K )

Which is:

1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2) (1 K^-1 )

Hmm, this feels a bit off. Wait, perhaps I should instead write the equation as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (ΔE/(k)) )

Wait, but no, because when I rearranged earlier, it was (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (ΔE/(k)) )^{-1} ?

Wait, let me try again.

We have:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

So,

[1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k))

But ΔE/(k) is 1 K, so:

[1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2) / (1 K ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (1 K )

Which is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) / K

But K is 1 K, so:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2) * (1/1 K )

So,

1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

Hmm, but the options don't have 1/T2 -1/T1, but perhaps I can rearrange the equation.

Multiplying both sides by T1*T2 to eliminate denominators.

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2

Wait, let's see:

Take the equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) / K

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T1 - T2 = (ln(2)/K) * T1 T2

Then, rearranging:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/K

But since K=1 K, the right side is ln(2)/1 K = ln(2) * K^{-1}.

But K is 1 K, so 1/K is 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But this seems to complicate things with units. Alternatively, perhaps the units cancel because K is 1 K.

Wait, perhaps when K=1 K, the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which would match option D.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, no. Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but according to our equation,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So that's option D.

Wait, looking back, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's correct.

To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the populations of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Assuming the statistical weights \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the same for both stars, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star 1 and star 2, the populations in the upper and lower levels are related by the problem statement: the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches \( k \) (Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

To match the options, multiply through by \( T_1 T_2 \):

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \ln(2) \cdot T_1 T_2.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option **D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A**: Incorrect form; does not account for the temperature difference.
- **B**: Incorrect form; introduces an unnecessary sum in the numerator.
- **C**: Incorrect form; includes a squared term in the denominator that is not present in the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
