Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Oh right, di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, right? So the formula should include an ester functional group. Ester groups are usually O and O in the formula. Let me think, an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So the oxygen count would be from that.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Two are aromatic-Hs. That suggests that the aromatic protons are split into two sets. Maybe because the substituents are in a certain position, like para or ortho, but since it's di-substituted, it could be either. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, the ring's symmetry would determine the number of proton signals. For example, if the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be two sets: two equivalent sets maybe. But wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two groups, like maybe one substituent is electron-withdrawing and the other is something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are meta, which would cause different patterns.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while doublet of quartets is more complex. That might suggest a trans configuration or maybe a substituent adjacent to the double bond. Wait, vinyl groups in esters? Like maybe an ester with an adjacent double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester? Or perhaps a substituted vinyl group.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. So each –CH3 is a singlet? Or perhaps split into certain patterns. The absence of CH2 suggests that any CH2 groups in the molecule are either not present or their signals are not observed, perhaps due to symmetry or being split in a way that's hard to detect, but I think more likely that the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups. So maybe the substituents are either methyl groups or connected in a way that doesn't involve CH2.

So putting this together: the molecule has an aromatic ring with two substituents. One of the substituents is an ester group. Let's think about the structure. An ester would be something like O-CO-O, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. So perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like OAc (acetyl) or something else attached to the benzene.

Let me consider the possible structures. Maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group. Wait, but the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so maybe the substituents are a methyl ester and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. For example, a para-substituted benzene with an ester and a vinyl group. Or maybe meta.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So each substituent must have a –CH3. Or maybe one substituent has two CH3 groups. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester? Wait, no, an ester group is usually like R-O-CO-R', so if R is methyl, then it's a methyl ester. So if one substituent is a methyl ester, like OMe attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the two substituents could be an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl group. Let me think, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester (like -O-CO-OCH3, but that might not fit), or perhaps it's a more complex group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group. Wait, but then the aromatic protons would split into two signals. Let's think about the possible structures.

Wait, two substituents on the benzene ring. One is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R. But since the NMR shows no CH2 groups, maybe the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond, like a vinyl methyl group. Or perhaps it's a substituent that has a double bond and a methyl group.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. So the vinyl groups are split into two sets. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl proton is coupled with different numbers of adjacent protons. Maybe one is part of a trans configuration, and another is in a different environment.

Alternatively, think about the structure as having a conjugated diene. Or perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) attached to the benzene, and the other is an ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl methyl group. Like, one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3?), but wait, that would have more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (like OAc) and another group that has a vinyl and a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (like OMe attached to the benzene), and another group like a propenyl group. Or maybe the substituent is a substituent with a double bond and a methyl group, like a styryl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So two methyl groups are present. Let's think about the ester group. An ester group would be O-CO-O-R. If R is a methyl group, then that's a methyl ester. So that's one methyl group. Then, where's the other methyl group?

If the substituent is a vinyl group that has a methyl, like CH2CH2 would have a CH3, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So maybe one substituent is an ester (like OMe attached to the benzene), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached somewhere else with a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester and another substituent that has a vinyl group and a methyl group. Maybe a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2- attached? But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR says there are none. So perhaps it's not that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of the options. Let's check the possible degrees of unsaturation.

The formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N. So (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 DoU: which could be from the benzene ring (3 DoU), an ester group (which is a double bond in the carbonyl, so 1 DoU), and another double bond (like the vinyl group, so another DoU). That totals 5.

Option B: C12H14O2 → (2*12 +2 -14)/2 → (26-14)/2=6 DoU. So another DoU. Maybe another ring? Not sure.

Option C: C12H12O2 → (2*12 +2 -12)/2 → (26-12)/2=7 DoU. That's 7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → (2*11+2 -12)/2 → (24-12)/2=6 DoU.

So the DoU depends on the structure. The benzene ring is 3 DoU. The ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU). The vinyl group is another (1 DoU). So 3+1+1=5. So the correct formula would have 5 DoU, which points to option A (C11H14O2) with DoU 5, or option D (C11H12O2) which has 6. Wait, option A has C11H14O2. Let me recalculate. 2*11 is 22, plus 2 is 24. 24-14=10. 10/2=5. Yes, so 5 DoU.

So which formula gives 5 DoU? Option A: 5, option D:6.

So the unknown compound has 5 degrees of unsaturation, which would correspond to a benzene ring (3), an ester group (1), and a double bond (1, from the vinyl). So that fits with option A or D.

Wait, but the molecular formula is built from the substituents. Let's think about substituents. The ester group is O-CO-O-R. Let's say R is a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), which would add 3 carbons (from the ester: O, COO, and methyl). Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, so for R as CH3, it's O-CO-OCH3. So that's 4 oxygens? No, wait, the ester is O-CO-O-R, but the formula for ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the ester group adds O and COO. So for R=CH3 and R'=something else.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene are two groups. Let me think each substituent's contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH2. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like a group where the ester is part of a vinyl substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the two substituents are a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3. But wait, CH2=CH-CH3 has CH2 groups, which the NMR says there are none.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So two methyl groups. One might be from the ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other from another group, like a CH3 attached to a double bond.

Wait, but a CH3 attached to a double bond would be a vinyl methyl, which is like CH2=CH-CH3. But that has a CH2 group. Oh, but the NMR says no –CH2 groups. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a geminal di-substituent. Wait, but that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH3-O-CO-O-... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester substituent and another substituent that's a methyl group attached via a double bond. Like, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond adjacent to a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl, but without any CH2 groups. Like, maybe a group like CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which doesn't have a methyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond, but without any CH2. Like, maybe it's a substituent like CH2=CH-CH3. But that would have a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring and another substituent is an ester. But then, the aromatic protons would be... but the NMR shows two aromatic signals, so maybe the substituents are in para positions. So the benzene would have two substituents, each in para positions, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. That would make sense.

So, for example, substituents in para positions: one is an ester group, the other is a group that includes a vinyl and a methyl.

Wait, but the substituent that includes a vinyl and a methyl would be something like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that seems too complex.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group, and another substituent is an ester. Let's say the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) and CH2=CH2. But no, that doesn't add a methyl group. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester. Like, O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2... No, but that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the number of signals in the NMR. There are six signals in total. Let's break them down:

1. Two aromatic H: so perhaps two sets of protons on the benzene ring. That could be due to substituents in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets or something. For example, para substitution would give two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, in para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two sets: each pair of equivalent Hs. But in NMR, each set is a signal. So if the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would split into two signals, each a doublet. That matches the two signals described.

2. Two vinyl H: one as a doublet (maybe coupling with one neighboring H) and another as a doublet of quartets (coupling with two Hs, perhaps). This suggests that the vinyl groups are in different environments. Maybe one is part of a trans double bond and the other is cis, or perhaps one is attached to a substituent that causes different coupling.

3. Two CH3: each as a singlet or different multiplet. So each CH3 is in a different environment. So maybe one is from the ester (like OCH3) and the other is a methyl group attached to a double bond (like CH2=CH-CH3), but that can't be because it would have a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, what if the substituent is a group like a propenyl group attached to the ester? Like, substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that would have CH2 groups. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, again, that would have CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group where the methyl is attached directly to the double bond. Like CH2=C(CH3)-O-CO-OCH3. So that substituent would have a methyl group attached to the double bond, avoiding any CH2 groups. Let's see, the structure would be benzene ring with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=C(CH3)-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group without any CH2 in between.

Wait, another idea: perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a methyl group connected via a double bond to the ring. Like, CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent would be a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CMe.

But then, the structure would be benzene with two substituents: O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=C(CH3). Let me think about the NMR.

The aromatic protons would be two sets (as para substitution would cause two sets, each as doublets), so two signals.

The vinyl protons: the CH2=C(CH3) group would have protons on the CH2 and the CH3. Wait, no, CH2=C(CH3) would have two protons on the CH2, but wait, in that case, the CH2 is adjacent to the double bond. So the protons on the CH2 would be split into a doublet of quartets, perhaps, and the CH3 attached to the double bond would have its protons as a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group attached to a double bond in a way that doesn't have any CH2 groups. For example, the substituent is a group like CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene and doesn't have a methyl. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, but that again introduces CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the molecular formula again. Let's take option A: C11H14O2. That would have the molecular formula.

If the compound is a di-substituted benzene, with substituent groups that add up to C9H14O2 (since benzene is C6H6). Wait, no. Wait, di-substituted benzene is C6H4. So the substituents must add (R1 and R2) such that R1 + R2 + C6H4 = C11H14O2.

So, R1 and R2 together must be C5H10O2.

Wait, but each substituent is an ester group? No, only one substituent is an ester. Or maybe each substituent has parts of the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and another group that is an ester as well? No, that would complicate things, but let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group, and another is an ester group. Let's see:

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). So that's O-CO-OCH3, which is 5 atoms: O, C, O, O, CH3.

Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So that substituent adds 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH3 is 4 carbons? No, O-CO-OCH3 is O-CO-O-CH3: that's 4 carbons (the O doesn't count as a carbon). Wait, no, O-CO-OCH3 is O-C-O-C-OCH3? No, maybe I should count all the carbons. Benzene is C6. Each substituent is R and R', so:

If substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), that's 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH3 is O-CO-O-CH3: so the COO is two oxygen and two carbons, plus the methyl. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons: the COO is two carbons, and the methyl is one. So substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, adding 3 carbons.

Substituent 2: let's say it's a methyl group attached to a double bond. Like CH2=CH-CH3. Wait, but that has a CH2, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached via a double bond, like CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So substituent 2 would be CH2=C(CH3)-, which is a propenyl group, but that would have a CH2 group, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached directly to the benzene. But then, where is the vinyl group?

Wait, maybe one substituent is the ester (O-CO-OCH3) and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group without any CH2. So substituent 2 is CH2=C(CH3)-. But again, that has a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a geminal dimethyl group attached to a double bond. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acrylate group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2... No, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl group attached to an ester. Like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2... No, same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a double bond in such a way that there are no CH2 groups. Like, substituent 2 is CH2=C(CH3)-, but then the structure would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached directly to a double bond without any CH2, like CH2=C-CH3. Wait, that's CH2=CHCH3, which has a CH2 group. So that's not allowed.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the number of carbons in the formula. The options are C11H12O2, C12H12O2, etc.

Option A is C11H14O2. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 5 carbons (since 6 + 5 =11). But wait, substituents are two, so 5 carbons between two substituents. That would mean each substituent has something like 2 and 3 carbons.

Wait, substituent 1 could be a methyl ester: O-CO-OCH3. That's 3 carbons (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 would then have 2 carbons, but the substituent can't be just CH2 since that would be a CH2 group, which isn't allowed. Alternatively, substituent 2 is another group.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl. Wait, if substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, that's 2 carbons, but that doesn't have a methyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to another group. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (3 carbons) and a vinyl methyl group (2 carbons: CH2=C(CH3)), but that again would have a CH2 group.

Hmm... Maybe I should think about the NMR signals. Two vinyl Hs: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. Let me imagine the structure where substituent 2 is a CH2=CH- group attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl protons would be the two protons on the CH2 group, which would each be split by adjacent protons. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of protons. The 1H NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H signals: perhaps 2H each, so total of 4 aromatic H. Wait, benzene has six H. So if two substituents are para, each substituent would take two positions, leaving four H in two sets of two each. So four H in two signals: that's 2H each.

Then, the vinyl Hs: two signals. One doublet (maybe a trans coupling) and one doublet of quartets (maybe cis coupling with two Hs). So perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester. Wait, if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. Like, the substituent is a vinyl ester.

Wait, think about cinnamic acid ester. The structure would be benzene ring with a substituent like CH2=CHCOOCH3. So that's an ester group where the R is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, but that's a substituent with a vinyl group and an ester.

So substituent structure: O-CO-OCH2CH2COOCH3? No, perhaps it's O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

So, substituent would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's count the carbons: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is 6 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-CH3). Wait, no, wait: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is 5 carbons: CH2=CH- (2 carbons), COO (2 carbons), and CH3 (1 carbon). So that's 5 carbons in substituent. But benzene is 6, plus substituent 5 carbons: that would make 11 carbons total. But the substituent is attached as a single group, so the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 5 (substituent) =11. That's option A: C11H14O2. Let's check the formula.

CH2=CHCOOCH3 has the formula C5H8O2. Benzene is C6H6. So the total would be C11H8O2 plus H from substituents? Wait, no, the substituent is attached to benzene, so the overall formula would be C6H5-CH2=CHCOOCH3.

So the formula of the substituent is C5H8O2 (since CH2=CHCOOCH3 is 5 carbons, 8 H (CH2=CH-: 4 H, COOCH3: 4 H?), but wait, let me count:

CH2=CHCOOCH3: each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H, COO has no H, CH3 has 3 H.

So CH2=CH- is 3 H (CH2 has 2, CH has 1), and COOCH3 has 3 H. So total of 6 H in substituent. Benzene contributes 5 H (since it's di-substituted). So total H would be 5 (benzene) +6 (substituent) =11 H.

Wait, but substituent is di-substituted? No, benzene is di-substituted, so substituent is a single group. So the total formula is C11H10O2? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. Substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is C5H8O2 (since it's CH2=CH-CO-O-CH3: 5 C, 8 H (CH2: 2 H, CH:1 H, COO: O, O, and CH3:3 H. Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH3 has the formula C5H8O2.

So the molecule would be C6H5-CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the total formula is C6 + C5 = C11, H6-2 (since two H are replaced by substituents) plus H8 from substituent. So 6-2=4, plus 8 gives 12 H. Plus, the ester substituent has how many H? Wait, maybe this approach is getting too messy.

Alternatively, the molecular formula would be C6H5-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not matching the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. That would be a more complex structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molecular formula of the options again. Let's take option A: C11H14O2. Degrees of unsaturation are 5. Benzene (3), ester (1), and vinyl (1), so 5. That fits.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: an ester group and a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So if one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group, perhaps the vinyl group has two types of H. Like, in a trans configuration, the two vinyl H would be different, giving two signals.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). Substituent 2: CH2=CH2. But that doesn't add a methyl group.

Wait, another idea: substituent 2 is a CH3 attached to a double bond. Like CH2=CH-CH3. But that would have a CH2 group, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. But that has CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond to the ester.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of signals in the NMR.

The NMR shows six signals:

- 2 aromatic H signals.

- 2 vinyl H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets).

- 2 CH3 signals.

So, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), which has a CH3 (so that's one of the two CH3 signals).

Substituent 2 must have another CH3 and some vinyl Hs.

What if substituent 2 is a CH2=CH-CH3 group attached to the benzene? So substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3. Then, the substituent would have two vinyl Hs (on the CH2 group) and a CH3 group. But this substituent has a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. No, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond, but without any CH2. How? Like, substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached directly to the double bond. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=C(CH3)-. But that would have a CH2 group.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a geminal di-substituted group, like C(CH3)=CH2. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group where the methyl is attached to the double bond without any CH2 groups. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the benzene. But that substituent would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The correct formula must have an ester group, two substituents on the benzene, and the NMR signals as described.

Let me think about the ester group. An ester has the formula O-CO-O-R. R could be a methyl group, which would add one carbon. But if the substituent is a larger group, more carbons are added.

Another approach: the number of signals in the NMR.

Two signals for aromatic H: suggests that the substituents are para to each other, causing the aromatic protons to split into two sets. Each set would be two Hs, as para substitution leads to equivalent Hs on either side.

Two signals for vinyl H: perhaps each vinyl group is in a different environment. One is a doublet (coupled with one H), the other is a doublet of quartets (coupled with two Hs). So maybe the substituent has a CH2=CH group, where the CH2 is adjacent to another group.

Wait, if substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, that would have a vinyl group and an ester. But substituent 2 would then have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring and another substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both esters, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester and a vinyl methyl group, but without any CH2 groups. Maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH3-O-CO-O-CH2=CH2. No, that has CH2 groups.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the possible structures.

Another approach: the absence of CH2 groups in NMR suggests that any CH2 groups in the molecule are either not present or not visible. So the structure must not have any CH2 groups except possibly those in the ester or other functional groups.

Wait, the ester group O-CO-O-R: if R is a methyl group, then no CH2. But if R is ethyl, then there would be CH2 groups, which are not present.

So the ester must be a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), as any longer chain would introduce CH2 groups.

So substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3.

Substituent 2 must be a group that doesn't have any CH2 groups and includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl methyl group attached directly to the ring, such as CH2=C(CH3)-. But that would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond in a way that doesn't have any CH2. Like, substituent 2 is C(CH3)=CH2, but that would have a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a geminal dimethyl group attached to a double bond, like C(CH3)2=CH-. But that's not possible because geminal dimethyl would make the double bond impossible.

Hmm. Maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH2=C=O, but that's a ketone, which doesn't fit the ester part.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH3-C=CH2, but that's a CH2 group again.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure.

The NMR has two –CH3 groups. One is from the ester (OCH3). The other must come from a substituent that includes a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a methyl group attached to a double bond, but somehow without any CH2 groups. Like, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond in a way that doesn't have CH2.

But how? Maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH2=C(CH3)- attached, but that has a CH2 group.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH3-C≡C- attached to the ring. But that's an alkyne, not a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl Hs, so the substituent must have a double bond.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH3-C=O, which is an acetyl group. But that would be a ketone, not a vinyl.

Hmm. Maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH3-O-CO-O-CH=CH2. But that would have a vinyl group without any CH2 in between.

Wait, structure would be benzene ring with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and O-CO-O-CH=CH2.

But that would make two ester groups, which might not fit the initial problem. Plus, the formula would have more oxygen.

But the original problem only mentions an ester group in the FTIR. So maybe only one ester group is present.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is an allyl group attached to a methyl. But again, that would have a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring, and substituent 1 is the ester group. But then the vinyl signals would not be accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the number of protons in each group.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H: probably 2H each, so 4 aromatic H in total. Benzene has 6 H, so two substituents would take up two H each, leaving four.

- Two vinyl H: perhaps 2H each, but the signals are different.

- Two CH3: perhaps 3H each, so 6 H total.

Total H in the molecule: 4 + 2*(2) + 2*(3) = 4 +4 +6=14 H.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 → 12 H.

So the molecular formula should have 14 H. So the correct option is A, which has 14 H.

Therefore, the formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectral data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 signals, with no –CH2 signals. The options provided are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group (O-CO-O) confirms the presence of a carbonyl group, which contributes to the molecular formula.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic-H Signals**: Two signals suggest that the aromatic protons are split into two sets due to the substituents' positions on the benzene ring. This is consistent with a para-substitution pattern.
   - **Vinyl-H Signals**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a vinyl group with two distinct environments for the protons.
   - **CH3 Signals**: Two signals confirm the presence of two methyl groups, each in a different environment. The absence of CH2 signals suggests that no CH2 groups are present in the molecule.

3. **Molecular Formula**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens. The two substituents must account for the remaining carbons and hydrogens.
   - The ester group (O-CO-OCH3) contributes 3 carbons and 3 hydrogens. The second substituent must contribute the remaining carbons and hydrogens without introducing CH2 groups.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 3 degrees of unsaturation (DoU).
   - The ester group contributes 1 DoU (from the carbonyl group).
   - The vinyl group contributes 1 DoU (from the double bond).
   - Total DoU = 5, which matches the formula C11H14O2.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **C11H14O2 (Option A)**: Matches the molecular formula with 11 carbons, 14 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. The degrees of unsaturation (5) align with the structure described.
   - **C11H12O2 (Option D)**: Has 12 hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the NMR data showing 14 hydrogens.
   - **C12H14O2 (Option B)**: Contains 12 carbons, which is inconsistent with the structure described.
   - **C12H12O2 (Option C)**: Contains 12 carbons and 12 hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that satisfies all the spectral data and structural requirements is **C11H14O2**, corresponding to **Option A**.
