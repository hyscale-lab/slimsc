Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to think through each step carefully.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's see: position 1 is ethoxy (OEt), position 2 is tert-butyl (t-Bu), and position 3 is nitro (NO2). Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be different. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are ortho to each other, or how?

Wait, the numbering in benzene derivatives goes in such a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if I have substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Let me try to imagine that structure.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So if benzene is the base ring, the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are all adjacent to each other: ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro in a row.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. I need to figure out the order of reactions to add these substituents. Each reaction step is probably a substitution (like electrophilic substitution) or another type.

Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups of the substituents. So, the order in which substituents are added will determine the positions where subsequent groups attach.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (OEt): This is an activating group, ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl group (t-Bu): Also an activating group, since it's an alkyl group. It's a strong activating, para/ortho director. But tert-butyl is bulky, so maybe it's more like para when possible.
- Nitro group (NO2): A deactivating, meta director.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3. Hmm. Let me think about the order in which these substituents are introduced.

Since nitro is a meta director, it would direct incoming substituents to meta positions. But if it's introduced early, it could complicate the substitution positions for the other groups.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is introduced last because it's a strong deactivating group. Once nitro is on the ring, the ring becomes deactivated, making further substitutions harder. So perhaps nitro should be introduced last, after the activating groups.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2, nitro in 3. So the substituents are in adjacent positions. How can that happen?

Wait, perhaps the order of substitution is ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Or maybe nitro is introduced after ethoxy and before tert-butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a nitration reaction after another group is in place. Let's think step by step.

First, the starting material is benzene. The first substitution could be introducing ethoxy. But wait, benzene doesn't directly react with ethanol. So to introduce an ethoxy group, we probably need a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or something else. Wait, Friedel-Crafts isn't good for introducing oxygen-containing groups. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups, but for introducing groups like methoxy, we need a different method.

Ah, right, to introduce an ether group into benzene, we can perform an etherification. One method is the Schollkopf method, but more commonly, we can use a two-step process: first, a nitration followed by a reduction, but wait, that's for amines. Alternatively, perhaps using a diazonium salt.

Wait, another approach: benzene can be nitrated, then reduced to an amine, then undergo an alkylation, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps introducing the ethoxy group via alkylation.

Wait, no. Wait, benzene can't directly react with ethanol under Friedel-Crafts conditions because ethanol is a weak electrophile. So maybe it's better to first introduce an activating group that directs the incoming substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually difficult unless the ring is activated.

Wait, another method is the use of a benzene ring that's already activated. So perhaps first adding a group that activates the ring, like a methyl group, but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, another approach: to use a directing group. Let me think: if I want to add an ethoxy group, perhaps I can first introduce a nitro group, then reduce it, but that doesn't seem directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution after another group has been added. Or perhaps the ethoxy is added via a meta director.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is the first substituent. How? Let me think. Benzene can't directly react with ethanol. Wait, but using a nucleophilic substitution? Probably not. Alternatively, using a directing group.

Wait, another approach: use a Grignard reagent or something else. No, that doesn't fit here. Wait, perhaps using a substitution where a good leaving group is attached. But benzene is stable and doesn't usually have leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced as a side chain via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's tricky. Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl groups, not for introducing oxygen-containing groups like ethers. Or maybe through an alkoxy group.

Wait, perhaps I can use a chloro group as an intermediate. For example, benzene can be chlorinated (Cl), then converted to a diazonium chloride, and then treated with a solution of ethanol and H2SO4 to substitute the Cl with OEt. But that's a possibility.

So, benzene to chlorobenzene (Cl), then diazonium salt, then replace Cl with OEt. That would give me ethoxybenzene. Then, from there, introduce other substituents.

But let's see: if I have ethoxybenzene, where would the next substituent go? Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. So the next substituent would go ortho or para to the ethoxy.

But the target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So let me imagine the benzene ring with ethoxy at position 1. Now, the next substituent could be tert-butyl, which would be at position 2 or 4 (ortho or para to OEt). But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho to OEt. So after adding OEt, adding t-Bu ortho to it.

But how?

After OEt is attached, the ring is activated. So next, perhaps a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is difficult with bulky groups because the carbocation tends to rearrange. Alternatively, maybe use a more controlled alkylation.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an alkyl chloride or similar. So if I have ethoxybenzene, and I try to do a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, would that add t-Bu to the ring? The problem is that Friedel-Crafts tends to give more para substitution, but with bulky groups, perhaps it favors para or ortho? Also, the ethoxy group is a strong activating group, so the next substitution would be ortho or para to it.

Wait, but in the target, the t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1). So, if the next substituent is t-Bu, it would enter ortho to ethoxy.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts conditions may not work because AlCl3 is a strong Lewis acid and could deprotonate the ethoxy group, which is an activating group. Maybe that would deactivate the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let's think about introducing t-Bu first, then OEt, then nitro.

But the target has OEt at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So maybe after OEt is introduced, the next substituent is t-Bu in the ortho position, then nitro in the meta position relative to the OEt.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group. So once nitro is added, the ring would be less reactive. So perhaps nitro needs to be added last.

Alternatively, perhaps OEt is added first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But wait, let me think about the directing effects. After OEt is added, the ring is activated, so next substituents go ortho or para. If t-Bu is added ortho to OEt, then the next substituent (nitro) would have to be in a position that's directed by the existing groups.

Wait, if I have OEt at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2, then the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 2. Now, adding a nitro group. The existing substituents are OEt (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para). So where would the nitro group enter?

The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Wait, but when adding the nitro group, the ring is activated because OEt and t-Bu are activating. Or wait, no: the ring is still activated by OEt and t-Bu, which are activating groups. So the nitration would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but when adding a nitro group, the position would be influenced by the directing groups already present. Since the ring has OEt and t-Bu, which are both activating, the incoming nitro group (which is a strong deactivating group) would go into a position where it's directed by the dominant group.

Alternatively, the nitro group would be directed by the existing substituents. Let me imagine the substituents: OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2. The ring is activated, so nitration would be directed to ortho or para positions.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is meta to position 1 (OEt) and adjacent to position 2 (t-Bu). Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order in which substituents are added. Let's outline possible sequences.

Option 1: Add OEt first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

After OEt, the ring is activated. Adding t-Bu ortho to OEt. Now, the ring has OEt at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Now, where would nitro go?

The existing substituents are OEt (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para). Nitration would occur where the majority of the activating groups direct. So OEt directs to para (position 4) and ortho (position 2 or 6?), but t-Bu is at position 2, so perhaps the para position for OEt is position 4, which is meta to t-Bu (position 2). Alternatively, maybe the nitro would go into position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to OEt (position 1). Hmm, that could happen.

Wait, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (t-Bu) and next to position 4 (if any). Wait, in a benzene ring, position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 2 is next to 1 and 3. So if OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2, the next substituent (nitro) would be at 3 or 4.

Wait, but if I add nitro at position 4, that's para to OEt and meta to t-Bu. But in the target, nitro is at 3. So position 3 is meta to OEt (if OEt is at 1, positions 3 and 5 are meta). Hmm, position 3 is next to position 2 (t-Bu) and position 4.

If the ring has OEt at 1 and t-Bu at 2, then the next nitration would be where? The OEt directs to its ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). However, position 2 is already occupied by t-Bu, so the available ortho positions are 2 and 6. 2 is taken, so perhaps nitro would go to position 6? Or para to OEt would be position 4.

But wait, let me think again. The positions are 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), and the question is where would the nitro group go next. The ring is activated, so nitration is possible. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after it's added, the ring becomes less reactive. But for now, the ring's activation is high because of OEt and t-Bu.

The directing effect is a bit tricky when multiple substituents are present. The most activating group would dominate. OEt and t-Bu are both activating, but OEt is an electron-donating group through the O-atom, while t-Bu is donating through alkyl groups. OEt is a stronger activating group than t-Bu, perhaps, so it would dominate the directing.

So, the nitro group would be directed to ortho or para to OEt. OEt is at 1. So para would be position 4. Ortho would be positions 2 and 6. Position 2 is already taken by t-Bu, so positions 4 and 6 are available.

Wait, but the target molecule has nitro at 3, which is meta to OEt and adjacent to t-Bu. So if I added nitro in position 4, the substituents would be 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), 4 (NO2). But the target has nitro at 3. So that wouldn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the ethoxy group. Let's try that.

So, first, nitrate benzene to give nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps introduce ethoxy and t-Bu groups. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after nitration, the ring is less reactive towards further electrophilic substitution. So substituents added after nitro would have a harder time entering the ring. So perhaps this isn't the best approach.

Wait, but maybe I can introduce another group after nitration. Let me think: if I have nitrobenzene, and then I try to add ethoxy, but the ring is deactivated. Maybe I can't do Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, nitro groups are meta directors. So if I have nitro at position 1, the next substituent would go to position 3 or 5 (meta to nitro). But in the target, the nitro is at 3, OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2. So if the nitro is at 3, then OEt would have to be at position 1, which is meta to nitro?

Wait, no. Let me think about the target structure again. Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So positions 1: OEt, 2: t-Bu, 3: NO2. So nitro is at 3, OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2. So nitro is meta to OEt (since 1 and 3 are meta), and adjacent to t-Bu.

Wait, in that case, maybe the nitro group is added after the OEt and t-Bu are in place. But then the ring is activated, so nitration would be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy group. Because, if I add nitro first, then OEt, but since nitro is deactivating, adding OEt afterward may not be possible via electrophilic substitution. So that might not work.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which isn't usually the case unless strong activating groups are present, like -NH2. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps after introducing a nitro group, the ring is so deactivated that adding OEt is not feasible. So that sequence might not be viable.

Hmm, perhaps the order is OEt, then nitro, then t-Bu. Let me see.

Wait, if I have OEt at position 1, then nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to OEt). Then, adding t-Bu at position 2. But would that be possible?

Wait, after OEt and nitro (positions 1 and 3), the ring now has OEt (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So the ring is somewhat deactivated. The remaining positions are 2,4,5,6.

The t-Bu addition would require the ring to be activated, which is tricky after nitro is present. Because nitro is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult.

So perhaps the nitro should be added last, after the ethoxy and t-Bu are in place.

Wait, but after ethoxy and t-Bu are added, the ring is highly activated. Then, adding nitro via nitration would position it based on the existing groups.

So, let's suppose the order is OEt first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

OEt at 1: add ethoxy to benzene. Then, add t-Bu ortho to OEt (position 2). Then, nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu and meta to OEt.

But how would the nitrations direct in that case? Let's imagine the substituents are OEt at 1 and t-Bu at 2.

So, when adding nitro, which is an electrophilic substitution, the nitro group would be directed by the OEt and t-Bu. OEt is a strong activating group, so it directs to ortho and para. t-Bu is activating, ortho/para.

The available positions are 3,4,5,6.

OEt at 1: para is 4, ortho are 2 and 6. 2 is already occupied by t-Bu. So nitro could go to 4 or 6.

t-Bu at 2: para is 6, ortho are 1 and 3. 1 is taken by OEt, so t-Bu directs to 3 and 6.

So, the available positions where nitro can go are 3,4,6.

Positions 3 and 6 are ortho to t-Bu and OEt, respectively. So, perhaps the nitro group would go to position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to OEt (position 1). That fits the target.

So, adding nitro would result in position 3.

So the order of substitution is OEt, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Now, how to carry out these reactions.

First step: introduce OEt group into benzene.

As I thought earlier, perhaps via a diazonium salt. Benzene can be nitrated, then reduced to an amine, then undergo alkylation to introduce OEt.

Wait, but that's a three-step process. Let me think.

Alternative approach:

Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Nitrobenzene → reduction (H2/Pd, perhaps) → aniline.

Aniline → alkylation (e.g., with ethyl bromide and NaOH) → ethyl group attached to the amine.

But wait, if I have aniline, and I alkylate it, I would get N-ethyl aniline. Then, how to convert that into ethoxy?

Alternatively, perhaps after reduction, I have an amine, which can then undergo a substitution reaction. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different method to introduce OEt. Another method is to use an alkoxy group via a substitution reaction. For example, if I have a chlorobenzene, I can substitute Cl with OEt using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be strongly activated, which isn't the case with benzene.

Wait, perhaps I can first introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then perform a nucleophilic substitution.

So, step 1: benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: reduce nitrobenzene to aniline (using H2 and a catalyst, maybe).

Step 3: treat aniline with ethyl bromide in a base to alkylate the amine, giving N-ethyl aniline.

But that introduces an ethyl group on the amine, not on the ring.

Wait, that's not helpful for adding an OEt group on the ring.

Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Another way to add an OEt group is through the use of a directing group. For example, introduce a nitro group, then a substituent that can be converted into OEt.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first, OEt is added, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to add OEt.

Wait, perhaps I can use a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that adds an acyl group, not an OEt.

Alternatively, perhaps using a diethyl sulfate or some other ethoxy group source. But I'm not familiar with a direct method.

Wait, perhaps using the method of converting a benzene to a phenol, then making it into an ether. But that would require introducing a hydroxyl group first.

Benzene can be nitrated, then reduced to an amine (aniline), which can then be oxidized to a phenol (but I'm not sure about that step).

Alternatively, using a side chain method. For example, benzene can be ethylated via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that adds an ethyl group directly, not an OEt.

Wait, maybe using a benzene ring with a leaving group, like Cl, and then substituting with OEt. But benzene doesn't have a Cl unless we first chlorinate it.

So, here's a possible sequence:

1. Chlorinate benzene → chlorobenzene (using Cl2, FeCl3).

2. React chlorobenzene with a strong base and ethanol to perform an aromatic nucleophilic substitution. But this is challenging unless the ring is activated.

Wait, but chlorobenzene isn't activated enough for nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps using a directed metallation.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the options provided and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each one has a series of steps. Let me try to parse each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation?

Wait, option A's steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

Wait, but wait, option A seems to have steps beyond that. Hmm, perhaps I need to list all the steps.

But the target molecule has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and nitro. So the reaction sequence must involve adding three groups.

Wait, looking at each option:

Option A: Steps i, ii, iv, v, vi, vii, viii, ix.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about when each substituent is added.

Another approach: the desired product has OEt, t-Bu, and nitro. So the reactions would involve Friedel-Crafts for t-Bu and OEt (if possible), and nitration. Alternatively, perhaps the OEt is introduced via a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add OEt to benzene.

2. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Nitrate the compound.

But how to add OEt.

Alternatively, perhaps OEt is added via a nucleophilic substitution: benzene is first chlorinated, then the Cl is replaced with OEt. But benzene isn't reactive enough for that unless activated.

Wait, another way: Using a benzene ring with a strong activating group, like t-Bu, to direct the incoming OEt.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

Add t-Bu first, then OEt, then nitro.

But how?

Let me think: First, benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

Then, add OEt. But Friedel-Crafts alkylation may not be feasible after adding t-Bu because the ring is activated, but maybe it's possible with OEt.

Wait, no, OEt isn't an alkylating agent. Alternatively, maybe OEt is added via a substitution. Once t-Bu is attached, the ring is activated, so perhaps another substitution can occur.

Alternatively, perhaps OEt is added via an etherification reaction, such as a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky unless the ring is activated.

Wait, perhaps first add t-Bu, then nitrate, then substitute a group for OEt. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the OEt group is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the OEt is added via a coupling reaction, but that’s beyond basic synthesis steps.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine → aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add t-Bu to aniline? But aniline is very activating, so it's easy to add substituents.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts would require that the ring is activated. Aniline is strongly activating, so adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would be possible.

But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add in the para position relative to the amine.

But the target has OEt at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So if we have nitro at 3, OEt at 1, and t-Bu at 2, perhaps this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps the order in option D is: nitrate first, then reduce, then add t-Bu, then nitrate again, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is OEt, then t-Bu, then nitro.

So the reactions would be:

1. Introduce OEt to benzene.

2. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Nitrate the ring to add NO2.

But again, the problem is step 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct order involves adding the ethoxy group via a substitution, and then the other groups.

Another thought: Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Alkylate amine with ethyl group to get N-ethyl aniline.

4. Then, perform a substitution to replace the amino group with OEt.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to convert an amino group into ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Hofmann elimination or some other method, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps after getting aniline, perform a substitution with OEt.

But I'm not sure about the exact reagents.

Hmm, maybe I should look for a reaction sequence that allows adding OEt, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. But that would add an acyl group, which upon reduction would become a CH2OEt group. Not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can first introduce a methyl group, then a nitro group, then perform a substitution. But this seems like a stretch.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituents' activating and deactivating effects and the order of adding them.

Since nitro is deactivating, it's best added last. So the steps should be OEt and t-Bu first, then nitro.

So, which options have nitration as the last step?

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → make diazonium.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure. Probably not.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Not sure.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, this seems to involve multiple nitrations, reductions, etc.

Wait, the target molecule has one nitro group. So any sequence that has multiple nitration steps might be introducing more nitro groups, which isn't desired. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option B.

Wait, perhaps option C's steps are:

i) Add t-Bu.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Reduce.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Nitrate again.

vii) Hydrolyze.

viii) Dilute H2SO4.

ix) Substitute with OEt.

But I'm getting lost here.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after adding a leaving group. For example, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via replacing a nitro group.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think: Suppose we nitrate first, then reduce to an amine, then substitute the amine with OEt.

But how?

Wait, aniline can be treated with EtBr in a basic condition to form N-Et aniline, but that would replace H on amine with Et, not OEt.

Wait, perhaps after nitration and reduction to amine, the amine can be converted into an ethoxy group via some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution where the amine acts as a leaving group, but that's not straightforward.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options again.

The target molecule has OEt, t-Bu, nitro in positions 1,2,3 respectively.

So, the substituent order is such that each new group is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Perhaps another approach is to consider the directing effects step by step.

First, adding ethoxy. Suppose we have OEt at position 1. Then, the next group (t-Bu) would be added ortho or para to OEt. It's added at position 2 (ortho). Now, the third group (nitro) is added meta to OEt and adjacent to t-Bu, which would be position 3.

So, the order is OEt, t-Bu, nitro.

Now, how to introduce OEt. Let's think about a possible method.

One method is to use the ethyl group as a directing group. Wait, perhaps first add a tert-butyl group, then OEt, then nitro.

But how to add OEt after t-Bu.

Wait, after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated. Then, introduce OEt via Friedel-Crafts? No, because OEt is not an alkylating agent for Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, maybe via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps we can first introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then substitute with OEt.

Let me outline:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Introduce OEt group via a substitution. Wait, aniline can be treated with ethyl bromide in NaOH to form N-Et aniline, but that's an alkylation, not an ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps converting the amine into a diazonium salt, then performing a coupling reaction, but that's for introducing aryl groups, not OEt.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using a benzene ring with a good leaving group, like a tosyl group, and then substituting it with OEt. But how to get the leaving group in place.

Alternatively, perhaps using a two-step process where a group is first added, then another group, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps using a coupling reaction to add the ethoxy group, but that's beyond my current knowledge.

This is getting too time-consuming, and I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, each one has a series of steps. Let me consider each step in the options.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate (introduce a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong activating, meta director).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe of a nitro group to amine?).

viii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution, perhaps introducing OEt via SN2.

Wait, this seems to involve adding multiple nitro groups and reducing them, which might not lead to the desired product.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

This also seems complicated, with multiple nitrations and reductions.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Again, multiple nitrations and reductions, which may not be correct.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) SO3 → sulfonate.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

This also seems to involve too many steps and possibly adding multiple nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B or C.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate → add nitro group meta to t-Bu.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Substitute amine with OEt.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps after nitrating, the nitro group is in position 3. Then, reduce it to amine, then substitute with OEt.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

After adding t-Bu, nitrate to introduce nitro group at position 3 (meta to t-Bu). Then, perform a substitution reaction to replace the nitro group with OEt.

Wait, but nitro groups are not easily replaceable. Alternatively, perhaps reduce the nitro group to an amine, then substitute the amine with OEt.

Wait, that might be possible. Let's think:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro group added at position 3 (meta to t-Bu).

3. Reduce nitro to amine → amine at position 3.

4. Substitute amine with OEt.

But how to substitute an amine with OEt.

Wait, perhaps using a diazonium salt and then substituting with OEt.

Aniline can be converted into a diazonium salt, which can undergo a coupling reaction, but that typically requires a strongly activated aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps treating the diazonium salt with a nucleophile like OEt in a substitution reaction.

Wait, in this case, the ring has a t-Bu group and an amine (from nitro reduction). So the steps would be:

After step 4, the compound is 3-amino-2-t-Bu benzene.

Then, reacting with ethyl bromide in a basic condition might alkylate the amine, but that would add an ethyl group, not OEt.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution where the amino group is replaced by OEt. But I don't recall a straightforward reaction for that.

Wait, perhaps using a Hofmann degradation or some other method to convert the amine into an ether.

Hofmann degradation converts an amine into an amide, which upon treatment with Br2 and NaOH gives an alkylated product, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Mitsunobu reaction, but that's more advanced and I'm not sure if it's applicable here.

Hmm, perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the OEt is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, after adding t-Bu and nitro, the ring would have t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). The ring's overall activation is questionable, making substitution difficult.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D: Steps are nitrate, reduce, add t-Bu, nitrate again, then some other steps.

But I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about the substituent positions again.

The target molecule has substituents at 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2). So in terms of their positions, they're all adjacent (1,2,3). So perhaps the substituents are added in a way that each is ortho to the previous.

So, first add OEt, then add t-Bu ortho to OEt, then add nitro ortho to t-Bu, but that would make nitro at position 3.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Add OEt to benzene.

2. Add t-Bu ortho to OEt.

3. Add nitro ortho to t-Bu.

But how to add OEt.

Wait, perhaps the OEt is added via a nucleophilic substitution. Let me think: benzene can't undergo that, but perhaps benzene is first converted into a chloride, then the Cl is replaced with OEt.

So:

1. Benzene → chlorinate → chlorobenzene.

2. Chlorobenzene → substitute Cl with OEt using a strong base and ethanol. But as I thought earlier, chlorobenzene isn't reactive enough for nucleophilic substitution without a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group to position the OEt.

Wait, perhaps another approach: use a diethyl sulfate to perform a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

If all else fails, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, looking at option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu to aniline.

Aniline is a strong activating group, so when you perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the t-Bu would add in the para position relative to the amino group.

So, after step iii, the structure would be 4-t-Bu-aniline.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

The nitro group would add in the meta position relative to the amino group, which is position 2 or 6. But how does this fit into the target structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine:

Aniline has NH2 at position 1. After adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (step iii), t-Bu is at position 4. Then, nitration (step iv) would add nitro group at position 3 (meta to NH2) or perhaps position 6 (ortho to t-Bu).

Wait, but if the amino group is at 1, t-Bu at 4, then nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to amino) or position 2 or 6 (ortho to t-Bu).

Assuming nitro adds at position 3, which is meta to amino and adjacent to position 2 (if any substituent).

But the target has OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So this may not fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration and other steps, the substituents are rearranged.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The correct sequence likely involves adding ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro. Among the options, perhaps option D is correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but option D starts with nitration, which would lead to nitro as the first substituent, making the ring less reactive. Then, subsequent reactions would be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

This seems complicated, but perhaps after adding t-Bu and nitro, followed by reduction, substitution, etc., the OEt would be introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate (add a strong activating group).

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, perhaps after adding t-Bu and sulfonic acid (SO3), which is a strong activating group, then nitrating.

Wait, but after sulfonation, the ring is strongly activated, making nitration easier. After nitration, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position directed by the sulfonic acid group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Given all that, I think the correct option is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, considering that in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to OEt and adjacent to t-Bu, perhaps the nitro is added last.

So, the correct sequence is OEt first, t-Bu second, nitro third.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B or C or D might have this sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

But I'm not making progress. I'll have to make a guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl (t-Bu) at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reaction sequences provided in the options.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Ethoxy (OEt) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - Tert-butyl (t-Bu) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - Nitro (NO2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
   - The nitro group should ideally be introduced last because it deactivates the ring, making further substitutions difficult.

2. **Target Structure**:
   - The substituents are positioned as follows: OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, and NO2 at 3. This suggests that OEt and t-Bu are introduced first, and NO2 is added last.

3. **Reaction Sequences**:
   - The order of substitution is critical. OEt and t-Bu are added first, followed by NO2. The challenge lies in determining how to introduce OEt, as benzene cannot directly react with ethanol under typical electrophilic substitution conditions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**:
  - Begins with tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl) via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by nitration and sulfonation. However, this sequence does not clearly account for the introduction of the ethoxy group, which is essential for the target molecule. This option is unlikely to yield the desired product.

- **Option B**:
  - Starts with t-BuCl/AlCl3 for Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by nitration and reduction. However, the sequence becomes convoluted with multiple nitrations and reductions, which may not align with the desired substitution pattern. The introduction of OEt is unclear, making this option less plausible.

- **Option C**:
  - Begins with t-BuCl/AlCl3, followed by sulfonation and nitration. While sulfonation activates the ring, the sequence involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which complicates the synthesis. The introduction of OEt is also ambiguous, making this option less likely.

- **Option D**:
  - Starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl. This sequence introduces nitro first, which deactivates the ring, making subsequent substitutions difficult. While t-Bu can be added, the introduction of OEt is unclear, and the sequence does not align well with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired substitution pattern and the introduction of the ethoxy group. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** appears to come closest to the required steps, despite its complexity and the ambiguity in introducing OEt.
