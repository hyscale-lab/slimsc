Okay, I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think. So the researchers have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting. Transits happen when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, blocking some light. The probability of this depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital distances, I think.

Wait, both planets have the same mass, right? But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—it's three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. Also, the host stars have the same radii but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host.

Wait, but what determines the transit probability? Oh right, the transit probability (p) is given by the formula p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ), but wait, that's maybe more detailed than needed. Alternatively, the probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's orbital speed around the barycenter or something else? Or maybe it's the other way.

Wait, no, maybe the transit probability is approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but wait, I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1/a) but that doesn't sound right. Or maybe it's the other way around—larger planets, smaller stars, and closer-in planets have higher transit probabilities.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), but adjusted by the orbital distance. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital distance and the size of the star. Let me think again.

The transit probability (p) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is higher for planets that are closer to their star because the orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach. The probability of transit depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. But wait, actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is calculated as the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk, but that's just the geometric probability. But wait, that's not considering the orbital distance. Hmm. Wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, right? But that's just the chance that the planet's path in front of the star, without considering the orbital plane orientation.

Wait, I'm confusing a few factors here. Let me look this up in my mind. The formula for the transit probability is p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) / R_s )) ). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, I think I'm getting tangled up here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The chance that a planet transits is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on. So if two planets are at different distances, the closer one has a higher probability. But in this case, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, so it's closer to its star. So if they are both at different distances, their transits' probabilities would vary.

Wait, but the host stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2. So that part remains the same. So the probability of transit would be (R_p1 / R_s)^2 multiplied by some function of their orbital distances. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is given by the formula: p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a^2 (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ))), but maybe that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about Kepler's third law. The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a³. Since the planets' masses are much smaller than their stars, we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So P² ∝ a³ / M_s. 

Given that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's, so P1 = (1/3) P2. So (P1)^2 = (1/9) (P2)^2. So for the two planets, (a1^3) / M1 = (a2^3) / M2. Because M1 = 2 * M2 (since the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host), let's write that.

So a1³ / (2 M2) = ( (3 P1)^2 ) / (since P2 = 3 P1, so P2 = 3 P1, so (P2)^2 = 9 (P1)^2, but I think I need to set up the proportion correctly.

Wait, let me put this more clearly. For each planet:

For Planet_1: P1² = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³

For Planet_2: P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³

Given that M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2 / 3.

So substituting M1 as 2 M2 into the equation for Planet_1:

P1² = (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1³

And for Planet_2: P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³

We can take the ratio of P2² to P1²: (P2²)/(P1²) = [ (4π²/(G M2) a2³ ) ] / [ (4π²/(G 2 M2)) a1³ ) ] = (2 M2 a2³) / (M2 a1³) ) * (G M2 cancels out properly) Wait, let me compute this ratio.

So (P2²)/(P1²) = ( [ (4π²/(G M2)) a2³ ] ) / ( [ (4π²/(G 2 M2)) a1³ ] )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (a2³) / (M2) ) ] / [ (a1³) / (2 M2) ) ]

= [ a2³ / M2 ] * [ 2 M2 / a1³ ]

= (2 a2³) / a1³

Since P2 = 3 P1, (P2²)/(P1²) = (9 P1²)/(P1²) )=9. So:

9 = (2 a2³) / a1³

So 2 a2³ =9 a1³ → a2³ = (9/2) a1³ → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Wait, (9/2) is 4.5, cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So Planet_2 is farther away from its star than Planet_1 is from its.

Now, transit probability. The formula for the transit probability (p) is approximately:

p ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (R_s * (1 + M_p / M_s)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is a function of the planet's orbital distance and the star's radius. Let me clarify.

The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet is in front of the star as seen from Earth. It's given by the formula:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a * sin i) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)) ) )

But since both planets have circular orbits (e=0), and the inclination i is a parameter we don't know, but the probability depends on the distribution of inclinations. The probability of transit is highest when the planet's orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), and it's zero otherwise, but on average, considering all possible inclinations, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ) ? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability (assuming circular orbit and randomly oriented) is:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / (a (1 - M_p / M_s)^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's velocity around the barycenter to the orbital velocity. Alternatively, I think that the transit probability is given by:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a (1 - e²))^(1/2) )) )

But since e=0, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a )

Wait, but both stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2. So R_s is the same for both.

So p1 ∝ (R_p1 / R_s)^2 * (1 / a1 )

Similarly, p2 ∝ (R_p2 / R_s)^2 * (1 / a2 )

But wait, the planets have the same mass, but transit probability depends on the planet's radius. Wait, the question says they have the same masses, but what about their radii? Wait, the problem statement doesn't give any information about the planets' radii. Oh wait, no, the question says 'Earth-like' planets, so perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, the problem says both have the same mass, but their radii may differ. But the question doesn't give their radii, so perhaps in this problem, we can assume that their radii are the same because they're Earth-like. Or maybe we don't need to consider their radii because the problem states that they have the same mass, but maybe their radii are different. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, but the transit probability depends on R_p, the planet's radius, and R_s, the star's radius. But the problem states that both planets have the same mass, but it doesn't say anything about their radii. So maybe we should assume R_p1 = R_p2, but that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses R_p as the same for both since they're Earth-like. But the question doesn't specify, which is a problem. Wait, maybe I didn't read the question correctly. Let me read again.

The question says: "two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2." So perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's. But without specific data, perhaps in the calculation, the R_p terms cancel out. Wait, but if R_p1 = R_p2, then the (R_p/R_s)^2 terms are the same because R_s is the same for both stars. So the only difference would be the 1/a term.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each planet is around a different star, so R_s is the same for both, according to the problem. Both host stars have the same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, if R_p1 = R_p2, then the (R_p / R_s)^2 is the same for both. So the transit probability would be higher for the planet with a smaller a, because 1/a is larger. So Planet_1 is closer (since its period is shorter), so a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, wait, in the earlier calculation, I found that a2 is about 1.65 times a1. Because a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2. So p is proportional to 1/a. So p1 is larger than p2.

Wait, but I thought p is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (something involving a). If that something is 1/a, then yes, higher a gives lower p. So if a1 is smaller, p1 is bigger.

So if Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

But wait, let me make sure. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The geometric probability (ignoring the star's motion) is (R_p / R_s)^2. But the overall probability also depends on the orbital distance. Wait, or is it that the transit probability is just the geometric probability? Because if the orbit is edge-on, then the planet transits. So the probability is the fraction of the orbit where it's transiting, which depends on the alignment. The chance of an edge-on orbit is 1/(a/(R_s)) ) * (R_p/R_s)^2. Hmm, no, I think that might not be right.

Alternatively, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on is (R_s / a). So the probability of transit is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a). So p = (R_p²)/(R_s a).

So in that case, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a, and depends on R_p and R_s.

In this problem, R_p is the same for both planets? Because the problem says both have the same mass, but if they are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are similar. But the problem doesn't give their radii. Hmm. Oh, but the problem doesn't mention R_p, so perhaps we're to assume that both have the same R_p. Because if they don't, there's no way to compare.

Assuming R_p1 = R_p2, then p1 = (R_p^2) / (R_s a1), and p2 = (R_p^2) / (R_s a2). So the ratio p1/p2 is a2/a1.

From earlier, a2 ≈ 1.65 a1. So p1/p2 = 1.65. So p1 is 1.65 times p2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options, option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit." Option C says 1.65 times higher, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check. Assume R_p1 = R_p2, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

p1 = (R_p^2) / (R_s a1 )

p2 = (R_p^2) / (R_s a2 )

p1/p2 = (a2)/(a1)

Earlier, a2 = (9/2)^(1/3) a1 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So p1/p2 = 1.65, so p1 is 1.65 times p2. So Planet_1's probability is higher.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, 2.7 is much larger. How did I get 1.65?

Wait, my earlier calculation: a2³ = (9/2) a1³.

So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

Compute (9/2)^(1/3): 9 is 3², 2 is 2^1. 9/2 is 4.5.

cube root of 4.5: approximately 1.6506 because 1.65³ is approximately 4.49, which is close to 4.5. So yes, a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So p1 = (R_p^2)/(R_s a1) = (R_p^2)/(R_s a1)

p2 = (R_p^2)/(R_s a2) = (R_p^2)/(R_s * 1.65 a1 )

So p1/p2 = a2/a1 = 1.65.

So p1 is 1.65 times p2. Therefore, Planet_1 has higher probability, so they observe Planet_1.

Looking again at the options, option C says 1.65 times higher. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, wait a minute—am I certain about the transit probability formula? Let me think again. Another source I recall says that the transit probability is roughly (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. So p ≈ (R_p²/R_s²) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p²/(R_s a). So yes, that's what I used earlier.

So the ratio of p1 to p2 is a2/a1 = 1.65.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would choose Planet_1.

So the correct option is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( p \) is approximately proportional to:

\[
p \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the planet's orbital distance. Both planets have the same mass and Earth-like characteristics, but their orbital periods and host stars' masses differ. The host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), and Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star.

### Step 1: Orbital distances
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) and the star's mass \( M_s \). For circular orbits, the formula simplifies to:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

Given that Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} P_2 \)) and Planet_1's host star is twice as massive (\( M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2} \)), we solve for the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{s1}}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} P_2 \), \( M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2} \), and simplifying:

\[
\frac{(1/3)^2}{1} = \frac{a_1^3 / 2 M_{s2}}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 a_2^3}
\]

\[
2 a_2^3 = 9 a_1^3
\]

\[
a_2 = a_1 \cdot \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65 \cdot a_1
\]

Thus, Planet_2's orbital distance is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_1.

### Step 2: Transit probability ratio
Assuming both planets have the same radius (\( R_p1 = R_p2 \)) and the host stars have the same radius (\( R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s \)), the transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{\frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a_1}}{\frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_2 \approx 1.65 \cdot a_1 \):

\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers will prefer to observe Planet_1. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
