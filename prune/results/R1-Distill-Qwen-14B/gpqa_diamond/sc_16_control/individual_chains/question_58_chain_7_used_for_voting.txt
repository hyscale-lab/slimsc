Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, which aren't physical. So you need to regularize the theory, which means you find a way to make the infinities manageable so you can renormalize them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, incorporating gravity and quantum mechanics. But I'm not too sure about regularization here. Strings are extended objects, so maybe they don't have the same divergences as point particles? Or do they? But wait, I think string theory requires a background with a certain amount of structure, but perhaps it doesn't have the same types of divergences as, say, QCD or QED. Or maybe it does? I'm a bit vague on that.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? And with things like asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. Wait, but I also remember that QCD has a property called confinement, which is why we don't see free quarks. But about regularization: I think QCD calculations often require regularization because of loop divergences. Like, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences that need to be handled. So QCD would need regularization. So option B would require regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-established quantum field theory. I know that QED does require renormalization because of the divergences in loop diagrams—like the electron self-energy, photon vacuum polarization, etc. So without regularization, these infinities would be a problem, but through renormalization, we can absorb them. So QED definitely needs regularization. So option C isn't the right answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical means no quantum mechanics involved. So in classical ED, you just have Maxwell's equations, right? Maxwell's theory is a classical field theory and doesn't involve the renormalization process because it doesn't have the concept of virtual particles or loops. So in classical ED, you don't get the same type of divergences as in quantum theories because those come from quantum fluctuations. So in classical ED, you don't need regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. Therefore, this theory never requires regularization.

Wait, but wait—does classical ED have any divergences? For instance, things like the infinite self-energy of a charged shell or something? Oh right, there are issues in classical ED too. Like, the electric field of a point charge has a divergence at the origin. But how is that handled? I think in classical theory, you might use methods like the method of images or other techniques, but you don't regularize in the same sense as in quantum field theory. Because regularization is a way to deal with infinities that come from loop integrals in QFT. So in classical theories, you don't have these loop divergences because there's no such thing as particles going on-shell and off-shell in the same way.

So putting it all together, the only theory among the options that doesn't require regularization is classical electrodynamics. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the given options:

1. **Superstring Theory (Option A):** Superstring Theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, incorporating quantum mechanics and gravity. While it is an advanced framework, it still involves divergences that require regularization, particularly in calculations involving loop diagrams. Thus, it does require regularization.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (Option B):** QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and involves non-abelian gauge fields. It exhibits asymptotic freedom, where the coupling becomes weaker at high energies. However, QCD calculations often encounter divergences in loop diagrams, necessitating regularization techniques. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (Option C):** QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-established quantum field theory. It is known to require renormalization due to divergences in loop diagrams, such as the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. Regularization is a critical step in handling these divergences, so QED also requires regularization.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (Option D):** Classical Electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations) is a classical field theory and does not involve quantum mechanics or virtual particles. While it may have issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge, these are handled using classical techniques, not regularization. Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

The only theory among the options that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
