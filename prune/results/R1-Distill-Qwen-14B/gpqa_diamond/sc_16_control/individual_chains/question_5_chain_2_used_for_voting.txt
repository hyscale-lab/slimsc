Okay, let's try to work through this quantum mechanics problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each defined by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So first, I remember that a quantum mechanical operator for spin, like the Pauli matrices, often involves these 2x2 matrices. The operator P here probably represents the spin operator in some direction. The eigenvector corresponds to the spin-up state along that direction.

Wait, the operator given is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, so ny=0.

The general form of a spin operator for a direction n is given by the vector of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) = ( (ħ/2) σ_x, (ħ/2) σ_y, (ħ/2) σ_z ), where σ are the Pauli matrices.

The matrix for P along direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, right? So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the operator in terms of the given components. Let me write out each component's matrix.

Given:
P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator for direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute that. Let's denote n_x as a and n_z as b. Since n is a unit vector, a² + b² = 1.

So P = a*(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + b*(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which simplifies to:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [b, a], [a, -b] ]

Because the diagonal terms are from P_z: a term is (b)*(ħ/2) on (1,1) and -(b)*(ħ/2) on (2,2). And the off-diagonal comes from a*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]].

So P = (ħ/2) * [ [b, a], [a, -b] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

Here, λ is +ħ/2.

So the matrix for (P - λ I) would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [b, a], [a, -b] ] - (ħ/2) * I

Which equals (ħ/2) [ [b - 1, a], [a, -b - 1] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (b - 1) ħ/2 , a ħ/2 ],
  [ a ħ/2 , ( -b - 1 ) ħ/2 ] ]

To find the eigenvectors, this matrix must be singular, so its determinant is zero.

But wait, we're already considering the eigenvalue equation, so the eigenvectors are found by solving (P - λ I) v = 0.

So let me set up the system of equations.

Let the eigenvector be |v> = [v1; v2].

The equations are:

[( (b - 1) ħ/2 ) v1 + (a ħ/2 ) v2 ] = 0
[ (a ħ/2 ) v1 + ( (-b - 1 ) ħ/2 ) v2 ] = 0

We can factor out ħ/2 from each equation:

(b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0
a v1 + (-b -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0 → (b -1) v1 = -a v2 → v2 = [ (1 - b)/a ] v1

So that's the relation between v1 and v2.

Now, let's substitute v2 into the second equation:

a v1 + (-b -1) v2 = 0

Substituting v2:

a v1 + (-b -1) [ (1 - b)/a ] v1 = 0

Factor out v1:

[ a + ( (-b -1)(1 - b) ) / a ] v1 = 0

Since v1 can't be zero (unless v is zero, which is trivial), the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

a + [ (-b -1)(1 - b) ) / a ] = 0 → multiply both sides by a:

a² + (-b -1)(1 - b) ) = 0

Expand the second term:

(-b -1)(1 - b) = (-b)(1) + (-b)(-b) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-b)
= -b + b² -1 + b
Simplify: the -b and +b cancel, so it's (b² -1)

So,

a² + (b² -1) =0 → a² + b² =1

Which holds because a and b are components of a unit vector (n_x and n_z).

So the equation reduces to 0=0, which means the two equations are dependent, and we only have one condition: v2 = [ (1 - b)/a ] v1

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of v1. Let's choose v1 = a, then v2 = (1 - b).

Wait, no, because if v1 is arbitrary, we can set it to a, but perhaps it's better to parametrize.

Wait, perhaps to make it normalized, we can write the eigenvector as:

v = [ (1 - b), a ]

Or perhaps another multiple. Wait, let's see. Let me check the normalization.

Wait, perhaps I went wrong when I set v1 = a. Let me think again.

Wait, in the equation, v2 = (1 - b) v1 / a. Because from earlier:

v2 = [ (1 - b) / a ] v1.

So let me write the vector as [v1; (1 - b)/a v1]. Let me factor v1:

v1 [ 1; (1 - b)/a ]

To make it a unit vector, the magnitude squared must be 1.

So the magnitude squared is |v1|^2 [ 1^2 + ( (1 - b)/a )^2 ] = 1.

Assuming v1 is real, for simplicity.

So |v1|^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - b)^2 ) / a^2 ] = 1.

So v1 = 1 / sqrt( 1 + ( (1 - b)^2 ) / a^2 )

But let me compute that denominator.

Denominator inside sqrt:

[ a^2 + (1 - b)^2 ] / a^2.

So sqrt( [ a^2 + (1 - b)^2 ] / a^2 ) )= sqrt( a^2 + (1 - b)^2 ) / |a|

So v1 is 1 / [ sqrt( a^2 + (1 - b)^2 ) / |a| ) ]

Which is |a| / sqrt( a^2 + (1 - b)^2 )

But since a can be positive or negative, but we'll take it positive for simplicity.

So v1 = a / sqrt( a^2 + (1 - b)^2 )

And v2 = (1 - b)/a * v1 = (1 - b)/a * [ a / sqrt(...) ] = (1 - b)/ sqrt( ... )

So the vector is:

[ a / D, (1 - b)/ D ]

where D = sqrt( a^2 + (1 - b)^2 )

Hmm, but perhaps there's a better way to express this.

Alternative approach: Since the operator is along direction (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenvector for spin-up would be in terms of the spherical coordinates. For example, in the standard basis, the spin-up state along (n_x, 0, n_z) would be expressed as a combination of the spin-up and spin-down states.

Wait, another thought: The eigenstates for spin in an arbitrary direction (θ, φ) can be written using Euler angles. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or φ=π?

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so φ is zero or π, depending on the direction. Let me think, perhaps θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, the direction vector can be written as (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ). But since it's in the x-z plane, sin θ sin phi is zero. So phi is zero, and the direction is (sin theta, 0, cos theta). So the state would be expressed in terms of theta.

The general spin-up state along (θ, 0) would be:

|+> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>

But since phi is zero, it's cos(theta/2)|0> + sin(theta/2)|1>.

Wait, but that's for the direction along (theta, 0) in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let me check.

Wait, the spin-up state in the z-direction is |↑z> = [1; 0].

In the x-direction, it's (|↑z> + |↓z>)/√2, which is [1/√2, 1/√2].

In an arbitrary direction (theta, 0), it's cos(theta/2) |↑z> + sin(theta/2) e^{i phi} |↓z>. Since phi=0, it's cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) |1>.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

Wait, but let me think about the problem again. The operator P is given with components P_x, P_y, and P_z as defined. So when the direction is arbitrary in x-z, the operator is a combination of P_x and P_z.

Wait, but earlier, when I set up the matrix, I found that the eigenvector has components [a, 1 - b] up to normalization. But a is n_x, which is sin(theta) cos(phi), but phi is zero here, so a = sin(theta).

Wait, in this case, since direction is in x-z plane, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). So a = sin(theta), b = cos(theta).

So let's plug these into the earlier expression for the eigenvector.

Earlier, the vector components are [ a / D, (1 - b)/D ], where D is sqrt(a^2 + (1 - b)^2).

So a is sin(theta), b is cos(theta).

So (1 - b) = 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2).

a = sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So let's compute D:

D = sqrt( [ sin^2(theta) + (1 - cos(theta))^2 ] )

= sqrt( sin^2(theta) + (2 sin^2(theta/2))^2 )

Wait, 1 - cos(theta) is 2 sin^2(theta/2), right? So (1 - b) is 2 sin^2(theta/2).

So expanding:

D = sqrt( [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2))^2 ) + (2 sin^2(theta/2))^2 ] )

= sqrt( 4 sin^2(theta/2)^2 cos^2(theta/2) + 4 sin^4(theta/2) )

Factor out 4 sin^2(theta/2):

= sqrt(4 sin^2(theta/2) [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] )

= sqrt(4 sin^2(theta/2) (1) )

= 2 |sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so D=2 sin(theta/2).

So the components become:

v1 = a / D = sin(theta) / (2 sin(theta/2)).

Using the identity sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2):

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2).

v2 = (1 - b)/D = [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ] 

= [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ) ] = sin(theta/2).

So the components of the eigenvector are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is option C.

Wait, but what about normalization? Because the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] has a magnitude of sqrt( cos^2 + sin^2 )=1, so it's already normalized.

So option C is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. So the correct answer is C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each defined as $\hbar/2$ times specific 2x2 matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator along direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, which simplifies to:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
n_z & n_x \\ 
n_x & -n_z 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $(P - \lambda I)|\psi\rangle = 0$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$. Substituting $\lambda$ into the matrix, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
n_z - 1 & n_x \\ 
n_x & -n_z - 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 
v_1 \\ 
v_2 
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 + (-n_z - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, $v_2 = \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} v_1$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms consistency, and the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
v = v_1 \begin{bmatrix} 
1 \\ 
\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, $|v|^2 = 1$. The normalization factor is:

\[
D = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}\right)^2}.
\]

Using $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis), the eigenvector becomes:

\[
v = \frac{1}{D} \begin{bmatrix} 
\sin\theta \\ 
1 - \cos\theta 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Simplifying using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the normalization factor $D$ is found to be $2|\sin(\theta/2)|$. Substituting back, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} 
\cos(\theta/2) \\ 
\sin(\theta/2) 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: Incorrect normalization and dependence on $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: Involves $e^{i\phi}$, which is unnecessary since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane ($\phi = 0$).
- **Option D**: Incorrect normalization and dependence on $\hbar$.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\left(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)\right).
\]

**Answer: C**
