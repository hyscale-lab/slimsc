Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about determining the correct starting materials for two different reactions that produce a specific ketone. Let's break it down.

First, the problem says a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, both reactions produce the same product structure but with different stereochemistry: one is R and the other is S. Hmm, that's interesting.

The reactions are:
- Reaction 1: Compound A is treated with LiBH4 and then H+.
- Reaction 2: Compound B is treated with BH3 and then H+.

Wait, no—the products are the same compound but enantiomers, right? Because R and S are mirror images.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the reactions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used for hydroboration reactions, which are used in the reduction of ketones or aldehydes but with anti-Markovnikov addition. Or wait, no—BH3 is actually used in hydroboration-oxidation, which adds boron to the less substituted carbon in alkenes, then oxidizes to OH.

Wait, but in this case, the products are ketones. So perhaps the starting materials are something else. Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that structure must be a cyclic ketone. Let me visualize that. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, similar to pyrone. So the structure would have a ketone group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, so the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar? Or perhaps a cyclic ketone with a ring. Let me think. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran means a six-membered ring with one oxygen and five carbons, and the double bond is in the 2H position. So, the structure has a ring where one of the positions is a ketone. So, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but both reactions produce this same ketone but with R and S configurations. So the configuration of the product depends on the starting material's configuration.

But wait, the reactions are reductions. So the starting materials must have a carbonyl group that is being reduced. LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically for carbonyl compounds, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides. But BH3 is more commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which are additions to alkenes. Hmm, but maybe in this case, the starting materials are something else.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds. Let me think about the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with O, a ketone at C2, and an ethyl at C4. So the structure is:

O
||
C2 is the carbonyl, then the ring is connected. So, the ring is four carbons, but wait, no, pyran is a six-membered ring—five carbons and one oxygen. So the product is a cyclic ketone.

So to form this, the starting material might be a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that can be reduced to form this ketone.

Wait, another approach: think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reductant, more likely to reduce esters or other carbonyls. BH3, on the other hand, is used in hydroboration reactions, which typically add to double bonds. So maybe one of the starting materials is an ester and the other is an alcohol. Wait, but the products are the same ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals or something similar. Because upon reduction, the acetal would break down. Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reactions.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic ketone, which could come from the reduction of a cyclic ester (lactone) or a cyclic ketal. Wait, but LiBH4 can reduce esters to diols, but that's not directly leading to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone that's part of a larger structure, and the reduction forms the cyclic product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides? No, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe they're hemiacetals or acetals.

Wait, let me think about the product. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Let me think about how to form this. Maybe it's the result of a Claisen or Aldol condensation followed by reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's formed via a ketone undergoing some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ketone, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms the cyclic product.

Wait, another approach: the product has an ethyl group and a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an acyloxy compound, like an ester. For example, if the starting material is an ester with a structure that upon reduction can form a ring.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is used for reductions, like reducing esters to alcohols. But BH3 is used for hydroboration, which is an addition to alkenes. So perhaps one reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, and the other is a hydroboration leading to the same product.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. That's confusing. Because LiBH4 is a reductant, it would typically reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, but the product here is a ketone. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters or other carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and the reducing agents break them open.

Wait, another possibility is that the product is a cyclic hemiacetal that's formed from an aldose. No, maybe not. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a reduction of an epoxide. But that's not directly leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with substituents that can form the ketone upon reaction.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options for A and B.

The options give A and B as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations (S or R).

So both A and B are the same compound, but with R and S configurations. Wait, no. Let me look.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So the starting materials are enantiomers of each other.

Wait, why would the starting materials be enantiomers? Because the reagents are different, and maybe the reaction conditions lead to different stereochemistry.

Wait, the product is (R) when treated with LiBH4, and (S) when treated with BH3? Or vice versa.

Wait, but the product is a ketone in both cases. That's a bit confusing. So the product is a cyclic ketone, maybe from a starting material with a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or cyclic ethers, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reagents are reducing them to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product structure. It's 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has five carbons and an oxygen, making a six-membered ring. The ketone is at position 2, ethyl at 4.

So the ring is O connected to C2 (which has the ketone) and the ring has five other atoms. So the structure is:

O
||
C2 connected to C1 and C3. C4 is connected to C3 and C5, and so on, with an ethyl group on C4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal. When the acetal is treated with a reducing agent, it breaks down. But wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. If the starting material is a ketone protected as an acetal, LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but that would break the acetal. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization. Hmm, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are butyrolactones (cyclic esters) that upon reduction form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-ketoglutaric acid derivatives. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a six-membered ring. The starting material might be a ketone that can undergo cyclization under certain conditions. But the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3, which are reducing agents.

Wait, no, perhaps the starting materials are ketones, and the reagents are adding something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alkenes, and the reagents are adding across the double bond.

Wait, let's think about the reagents again. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, amides, nitriles, etc., to alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration, which adds to alkenes in a way that the boron attaches to the less substituted carbon (anti-Markovnikov).

So, if the starting materials are alkenes, then BH3 would add across the double bond. Then, upon oxidation, it would form an alcohol. But how would that form a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone, and the reagents are doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the ester would be reduced to a diol. But how does that form a ketone?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible starting materials given in the options.

The options for A and B are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, varying in their configuration (R or S). So, these are chiral centers. Let's break down the structure.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid has five carbons. The substituents are:

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (keto) groups.

Wait, numbering the pentanoic acid chain:

1   2   3   4   5
COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O-isobutoxy? Wait, no, the substituents at position 5. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carboxylic acid is at position 1, then position 3 is ethyl, position 5 has isobutoxy and oxo groups. Wait, in pentanoic acid, position 5 would be the methyl adjacent to the COOH. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it out.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the positions are from COOH as 1, then CH2 as 2, CH2 as 3, CH2 as 4, and CH3 as 5. Wait, no, actually, the numbering is from the COOH end. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: CH2
5: CH3

So, for 3-ethyl, that's at position 3. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but wait, the substituents are at position 5. Let me think again.

Wait, 5-oxo would mean a ketone at position 5. But in a pentanoic acid, position 5 is the end. So perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O?

Wait, no, wait. Let me look at the IUPAC name.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid: 5 carbons, with COOH on C1.

At C3: ethyl group.

At C5: isobutoxy and oxo groups.

Wait, so C5 is the fifth carbon, but since it's an acid, the chain is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) (C3) - CH2 (C4) - C(O) (C5) ?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the oxo is at C5, which would be the terminal carbon, but the acid is already at C1. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) (C3) - C(O) (C4) - O-isobutyl (C5)?

Wait, but that would make it a five-carbon chain, with substituents on C3, C4, and C5.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about how the starting material would form the product.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at C2 and an ethyl at C4.

If the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, perhaps upon reduction, the ester or another functional group is reduced, leading to the formation of the ring.

Wait, but the starting materials are the same except for configuration. So, how does the configuration affect the product?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester or something similar. For example, if the starting material is a beta-keto acid, then upon reduction, it could form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. Let's think about their effects. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which add boron to the less substituted carbon in alkenes, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition.

So, perhaps the starting materials are alkenes, and the reagents perform hydroboration to form alcohols, which then undergo some cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). When treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to a diol. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, the diol cyclizes to form a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and the reagents break the acetal to form a carbonyl group. But LiBH4 is a reducing agent, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. The product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting materials are diethyl ketals. When treated with a reducing agent, the ketal is cleaved, and the ketone is formed. But how about that?

Wait, if the starting material is a diethyl acetal (like a protected ketone), then upon treatment with a reductant, the acetal would break, and the ketone would be formed. But how would that form the cyclic structure?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone, and when the acetal is cleaved, the ketone forms and undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and upon reduction, the acetal breaks to form a diol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me try to think about the reaction conditions and the possible products.

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is typically used in hydroboration. So, perhaps in the first reaction, the starting material is an ester, which is reduced to an alcohol. Then, in the second reaction, the starting material is an alkene, which undergoes hydroboration to form an alcohol. Then, both alcohols cyclize to form the pyranone.

But then, how does the stereochemistry come into play? The starting materials A and B have different configurations, leading to different stereoisomers of the product.

Wait, considering that, maybe the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reaction conditions cause the product to form with opposite configurations.

But why would the same starting material with opposite configurations lead to different products with R and S configurations?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diastereomers, and the reaction conditions (different reagents) affect the product's configuration.

Wait, but the options say that A and B are either the same (options A and B) or enantiomers (options C and D).

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, which implies that the starting material must have a structure that upon reduction forms this ring. Let's imagine that the starting material is a beta-keto ester or something similar. When reduced, it could form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reactions. LiBH4 would reduce esters to alcohols, while BH3 would add to double bonds.

So, perhaps one reaction is a reduction of an ester to form a diol, and the other is a hydroboration of an alkene to form an alcohol, which then cyclizes.

But that would require the starting materials to be different in their functional groups, which they're not. Because in the options, A and B are the same compound, either the same configuration or enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting material must have a structure that can form this upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. For example, a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. When treated with a reducing agent, the acetal is cleaved, and the ketone is released.

But again, the product is a cyclic ketone, not a straight-chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals of a ketone. When reduced, the acetal opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a reductant. So perhaps the acetal is cleaved to form the ketone, but that doesn't fit because the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, it forms a diol. Then, the diol cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, for example, a five-membered lactone. Upon reduction with LiBH4, it would form a diol, which can then form a six-membered ring via cyclization.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like ethyl acetoacetate. Upon reduction with a strong reducing agent, the ester is reduced to a diol, which can cyclize to form the ring.

Wait, but ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester. If reduced with LiBH4, it would reduce the ester to a secondary alcohol, but the beta-keto group might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (as in the options). So, that's a five-carbon compound with a ketone at C5.

Wait, but that's confusing because the acid is at C1, and the ketone is at C5. So, the structure would be:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - CH2 - C(O) - O-isobutyl?

Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-isobutyl?

Wait, that would be 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the ketone is at position 5, which is also substituted with isobutoxy. The ethyl is at position 3.

So, upon treatment with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester group (if present) is reduced. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but LiBH4 doesn't typically reduce carboxylic acids. They're generally not reduced by LiBH4.

Wait, but the starting material in the options is a carboxylic acid, which may not be directly reducible by LiBH4 or BH3. So that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the acid is just part of the structure. But the options state that the starting materials are the pentanoic acid derivatives.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester, and the acid is formed after reduction. But that doesn't make sense with the given reagents.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. When treated with a reducing agent, the hemiacetal breaks down to form a ketone and an alcohol. But again, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an acetal group. Upon reduction, the ester is opened, and the acetal is cleaved to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the stereochemistry.

The product is (R) and (S) configurations depending on the reagent. The starting materials are enantiomers in options C and D.

So, if A is R and B is S, or vice versa, then the products would have different configurations.

Wait, but why would the configuration of the starting material influence the configuration of the product?

Ah! Because the starting material's configuration determines the approach of the reducing agent, leading to different stereoselectivity in the product.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically doesn't provide stereoselectivity because it's a hydride source that attacks from the less hindered side, but in some cases, such as in epoxide reductions, it can lead to specific stereochemistry.

Alternatively, BH3, which is used in hydroboration, is stereospecific. The hydroboration follows anti-Markovnikov addition and the boron attaches to the less substituted carbon. The stereochemistry of the addition depends on the structure of the starting alkene.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a different mechanism. For example, the starting material could be a cyclic ether with a ketone group, and the reduction breaks the ether, leading to the formation of the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to focus on the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is (S), B is (R)

Option D: A is (R), B is (S)

So, the starting materials are enantiomers, leading to different stereoisomers of the product.

So, when A is (S) and treated with LiBH4, it forms (R) product. When B is (R) and treated with BH3, it forms (S) product.

So, the reagents must cause the product to have the opposite configuration.

But why? Because the reducing agents approach the carbonyl group from a certain face, which would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, when LiBH4 reduces a ketone, it typically leads to the formation of an alcohol by adding hydride from the less hindered side, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde, and the reduction forms an alcohol, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide. When reduced, the epoxide opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ketone. But how would that lead to different stereoisomers?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and upon reduction, the hemiacetal breaks, leading to a diol that cyclizes into the pyranone.

But I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

For the product to be a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting material is an ester group in a ring structure. When the ester is reduced, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetate ester in a cyclic structure. When reduced, the ester becomes a diol, which then forms the ring upon elimination of water, leading to a ketone.

But how would the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexenone derivative. When treated with LiBH4, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. But that would form a secondary alcohol, not a ketone.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen or aldol condensation from the starting material, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ether group, and the reducing agents break the ether, leading to the desired product.

Wait, maybe I should look for the mechanism where the product is a cyclic ketone formed from a chiral starting material.

Wait, another angle: the product is a cyclic ketone with a specific configuration. The starting materials are chiral, so their configuration influences the face where the reduction occurs, thereby determining the configuration of the product.

So, for example, if the starting material is (R), when treated with LiBH4, the hydride attacks from a certain face, leading to (R) product. But if the starting material is (S), the attack would be from the opposite face, leading to (S) product.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so the reduction must be forming a new chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a chiral center. When reduced, the ester becomes a diol, leading to a new chiral center.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Let me think about the possible answer.

The options are about the configuration of A and B. If the starting materials are enantiomers, then treating them with different reductants would lead to products with opposite configurations.

So, if A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, it produces (R) product. And B is (S) and treated with BH3, it produces (S) product. So, the correct option would be D: A is (R), B is (S).

But wait, why would the same starting material with opposite configurations lead to opposite products when treated with different reagents?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents' approach leads to opposite configurations because the reducing agents approach from opposite faces.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may approach from a different face than BH3, leading to opposite stereoselectivity. So, if the starting material is (R), LiBH4 would form (R) product, and BH3 would form (S) product.

Wait, but that depends on the reaction's mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the reduction to occur with different stereochemistry.

So, for example, in the case where the starting material is (R), when LiBH4 reduces it, the hydride attacks from a certain face, leading to (R) product. Similarly, when BH3 is used, the approach is from the opposite face, leading to (S) product.

But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a cyclic transition state that depends on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option D: A is (R), B is (S).

Because when using different reducing agents, the approach of the hydride would be from different faces, leading to opposite configurations in the product. Therefore, the starting materials must be enantiomers so that each reagent produces the opposite product.

So, the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric cyclic ketones, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to understand how the stereochemistry of the starting materials influences the stereochemistry of the products.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the stereochemical course of the reduction.

The starting materials provided in the options are enantiomers: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These compounds differ in the configuration of their chiral center, which influences the approach of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry of the product.

LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. While LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which involve anti-Markovnikov addition to alkenes. In this case, the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the configuration of the starting material and the stereochemical outcome of the reduction.

When the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and treated with LiBH4, the reduction occurs in a way that produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Conversely, when the starting material is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and treated with BH3, the reduction occurs with a different stereochemical outcome, producing (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This relationship between the starting materials and the products is consistent with the enantiomeric nature of the starting materials and the stereochemical specificity of the reactions.

Thus, the correct pairing of starting materials is:

- A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (treated with LiBH4 to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one)
- B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (treated with BH3 to produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one)

This matches the description in option D.

Answer: D
