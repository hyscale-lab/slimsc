Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what I can remember from my studies.

Alright, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass greater than our Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But wait, I'm not sure if the mass plays a direct role here, maybe just context. The main focus is on their elemental abundances.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Hmm, I've heard that these brackets denote logarithmic abundances relative to the Sun. 

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So, I think that means nFe/nH is 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^-4.5? Wait no, wait. Because the formula is [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So the 12 + log(nX/nH) for the Sun is 7.5 for Fe. Which would mean log(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^-4.5.

Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 -12 = -5, so nMg/nH_sun is 10^-5.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], maybe? Or perhaps the ratio [n_Si1 / n_Si2]?

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so n_Si1 / n_Si2.

But to get that, I think I need to figure out [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio.

Let me think about how to get [Si/H] for each star.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So that means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the solar value. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If it's zero, then nFe/nH for Star_1 is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3. So, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But since nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun (because [Fe/H] is 0), let's express nFe1 in terms of H: nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of [X/H], which is the logarithm of (nX / nH) relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But since nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Then, nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^(0.3) * nFe1.

Wait, let's write that in terms of [X/H].

Alternatively, let me think in terms of [X/H] for each element.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance relative to H is solar.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 = 0.3 → So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 → which means nSi1/nH1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Wait, because [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun / nH_sun).

So yes, Star_1's [Si/H] is 0.3.

So for Star_1, the abundance of Si relative to H is higher than the Sun by 0.3 dex.

Similarly, let's look at Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → same as Star_1's [Fe/H], the Mg abundance relative to H is solar.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → which is log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) = 0.3 → So nMg2/nSi2 = 10^(0.3) * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun).

But since [Mg/H]_2 is 0, nMg2 / nH2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2.

Putting that into the previous equation:

nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2 / nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun).

Hmm, so rearranging:

(nH2 / nSi2) = (10^0.3) * (nH_sun / nSi_sun) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun) * (nMg_sun / nH_sun) )? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's try again.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2.

So substituting:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH2 ) / nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Multiply both sides by nSi2 and divide by (nMg_sun /nH_sun):

nH2 = [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) ] * (nH_sun /nMg_sun) ) * nSi2.

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me think differently.

We can express [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So, substituting nMg2 from earlier:

(nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2 / nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

We can cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

(1/nH_sun) * nH2 / nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (1/nSi_sun).

Multiply both sides by nH_sun * nSi2:

nH2 = 10^0.3 * (nH_sun / nSi_sun) * nSi2.

But nH2 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star 2, and nSi2 is the number of silicon atoms. So we can write nSi2 = (nH2) * (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 * nH_sun )) )

Alternatively, nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3).

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio nSi1 / nSi2.

Let me express nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2, respectively.

For Star 1:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) * 10^0.3 * nH1.

For Star 2:

nSi2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) * (nH2 / 10^0.3 ) ? Hmm, wait, I might have to re-examine.

Wait, earlier, for Star 1:

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → which means [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So, nSi1 = nH1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star 2, what's [Si/H]_2?

Wait, the given data is [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 =0. So perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2 using the given [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Since [Mg/H]_2 =0, that's nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So combining these two:

nMg2 = nH2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) → substituting into the next equation:

(nH2 * nMg_sun /nH_sun) ) / nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Multiply both sides by nSi2:

nH2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * nSi2.

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

nH2 / nH_sun = 10^0.3 * (1/nSi_sun) * nSi2.

Rearranging for nSi2:

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

So nSi2 = nH2 * (nSi_sun / (nH_sun * 10^0.3 )) )

Similarly, for Star 1, nSi1 = nH1 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Now, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 would be [nH1 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3 ] / [nH2 * (nSi_sun / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: nH1 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) * 10^0.3

Denominator: nH2 * (nSi_sun / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )) )

So ratio is [ (nH1 /nH2) ) * ( (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) ] divided by [ (nSi_sun / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )) ) * nH2 ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out terms.

Let me write it as:

(nSi1/nSi2) = (nH1 * a * b) / (nH2 * c * d) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let's factor all the terms:

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nH1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nH2) * (nSi_sun / (nH_sun * 10^0.3 )) ) ]

Simplify each part:

The (nSi_sun) in numerator and denominator cancel.

nH1 / nH2.

(nH_sun) in denominator of numerator and denominator: denominator has (nH_sun) in denominator, so in numerator, (nH_sun) is in denominator.

Wait, perhaps inverting:

The numerator has (nH1) * (1/nH_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

The denominator has (nH2) * (nH_sun) /10^0.3 → because denominator is (nH2) * (1/(nH_sun * 10^0.3 )) ), which is (nH2) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nH1) * (1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nH2 / (nH_sun *10^0.3 )) ) ]

Which becomes:

[ (nH1) / nH_sun * 10^0.3 ] * [ nH_sun *10^0.3 / nH2 ]

Simplify: nH1 *10^0.3 *10^0.3 / nH2.

Because (nH1 /nH2) ) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3) )

10^0.3 is about 2, but let's calculate 10^0.3 = approx 2, but more accurately, 10^0.3 ≈ 1.995 ≈ 2.

So 10^0.3 *10^0.3 =10^0.6 ≈3.98 ≈4.

So (nH1 /nH2) ) * 4.

But wait, do we know nH1 and nH2? Because the stars have different masses, but hydrogen abundance could vary. But unless told otherwise, I think we can assume that each star has the same hydrogen content relative to their own total, but wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give [H/Fe] or anything else about the hydrogen. So perhaps I should assume that the number of hydrogen atoms is the same for both stars? Or perhaps that the total number of atoms is the same? I don't think that's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the star isn't directly relevant here because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms per photosphere. So the ratio would be independent of the total number of atoms, as long as abundances are given.

Wait, but in the problem, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, which relates to the abundance of Fe and Mg relative to H. So if [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, then Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. But H may not be the same.

Wait, but in stellar atmospheres, the number of hydrogen atoms can vary based on metallicity, but in this case, perhaps the fraction of H is considered as 1 in the denominator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think differently.

Since the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, perhaps it's (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 /nH2), multiplied by (nH1 /nH2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi1 / nH1 ) * (nH2 / nSi2 ), but no, that's the ratio of (Si/H) in Star 1 over (Si/H) in Star 2.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is simply nSi1 / nSi2.

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, we can't compute the absolute number. But if the problem refers to the ratio of their abundances, perhaps it's the ratio of [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, no, because the problem says 'ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres', which is nSi1/nSi2. But without knowing the total number of atoms in each photosphere, which depends on their size, which isn't given, perhaps the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ), which would be [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but the [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, and I need to find [Si/H]_2 to compute the ratio.

So let's find [Si/H]_2.

For Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

We can relate [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H] to find [Si/H].

We have:

[Mg/H]_2 = log(nMg2 /nH2) - log(nMg_sun /nH_sun ) = 0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

Substituting nMg2 from above:

log( (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) /nSi2 ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

This can be rewritten as:

log( (nMg_sun * nH2 )/(nH_sun * nSi2) ) - log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) =0.3.

Using log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b), so:

log( (nMg_sun * nH2 )/(nH_sun * nSi2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) ) =0.3.

Simplify the argument inside log:

( (nMg_sun * nH2) / (nH_sun * nSi2) ) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun) ) = (nH2 * nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * nSi2 )

So, log( (nH2 * nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * nSi2) ) ) =0.3 → 

(nH2 * nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * nSi2) ) = 10^0.3.

Rearranging:

nSi2 = (nH2 * nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * 10^0.3 )

So from this, nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 )

Now, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So nSi1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nH1.

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

[ (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nH1 ] / [ (nH2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ) ]

Simplify:

The (nSi_sun) cancels.

nH1 /nH2 * (10^0.3 ) / (1/(10^0.3 )) )

Which is:

nH1/nH2 * (10^0.3 )^2.

So 10^0.3 squared is 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 ≈ 4.

So nSi1/nSi2 ≈ (nH1 /nH2) *4.

But wait, I don't know nH1 and nH2. How can I proceed?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which would be nSi1 / nSi2.

But without knowing the ratio of hydrogen nuclei (nH1/nH2), I can't compute this unless it cancels out, which I don't see happening.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the total number of atoms is the same for both stars? Or that each star has the same number of hydrogen atoms?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the photospheres have the same number of hydrogen atoms, but I don't think that's given.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.

Wait, the problem gives the photospheric composition of the Sun as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So the Sun's nFe/nH =10^(-4.5), nMg/nH=10^(-5).

But for the stars, we have [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But how does that help with nH1 and nH2? Maybe it doesn't, unless the stars have same nH. But that's not given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of silicon in the photospheres, meaning the ratio of their silicon abundance relative to hydrogen.

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2."

Wait, the ratio could be (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1 / nH1 ) * (nH2 /n_Si2 ) * (nH1 /nH2 )

Hmm, but unless I can find (n_Si1 /nH1 ) and (n_Si2/nH2 ), then their ratio would be [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2.

Wait, wait, because [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

If I can find [Si/H]_2, then I can compute the ratio.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

For Star_2, let's find [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

[Mg/Si]_2 is log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) =0.3.

We also have [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun )=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

Substituting into [Mg/Si]_2:

log( (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2) / (nSi2) ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) =0.3.

Which is log( (nMg_sun *nH2 )/(nH_sun * nSi2) ) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )) ) =0.3.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as log( (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *nSi2) ) ) =0.3.

Wait, because (nMg_sun *nH2 )/(nH_sun * nSi2) ) divided by (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) equals (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *nSi2 ).

So that's inside the log being 10^0.3.

Which gives (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *nSi2 ) )=10^0.3.

Rearranging:

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

So nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 )

Then, the [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi2/nH2 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Substituting nSi2 from above:

nSi2/nH2 = (nH2 /nH_sun * nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ) / nH2 = (1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 )

So nSi2/nH2 = nSi_sun/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

Which is log( nSi_sun/(nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun )

= log( 1/(10^0.3) ) → because the nSi_sun/nH_sun terms cancel.

So log(10^-0.3 ) → which is -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So now, I have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

The ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) = 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 )

Because [X/H]_a - [X/H]_b = log(nXa/nH_a) - log(nXb/nHb) ) = log( (nXa/nH_a) / (nXb/nHb) )

So (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) =10^(0.3 - (-0.3 )) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 ≈4.

But wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms, which is nSi1 /nSi2. However, (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) ) is actually (nSi1 *nH2 )/(nSi2 *nH1 ), which would be [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, that term remains. So I can't directly get nSi1/nSi2 unless the H counts are the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of (nSi1 / nH1 ) to (nSi2 /nH2 ), which would be the ratio of their [Si/H], which is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3 )) =10^0.6≈4.

But the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." Which I think refers to nSi1 /nSi2.

But without knowing the ratio of H, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars, i.e., nH1 =nH2. Then, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 would be 10^0.6 ≈4. Which would match option A (~3.9).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says the total number of atoms is the same. But I don't think that's given.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is [nSi1/nH1 ]/[nSi2/nH2 ] multiplied by (nH1/nH2 ). So, unless the (nH1/nH2 ) is accounted for, but I don't think we can get that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is set such that the ratio is [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So their ratio is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3 ))=10^0.6= approx3.98, so about 4.

Which would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1 )*(nH2/nSi2 ) → which is (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ) * (nH2/nH1 )

If nH1 =nH2, then the ratio is 10^0.6, which is ~4. So option A.

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, the problem must assume that nH1/nH2 =1.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass isn't needed because we're dealing with abundance ratios, and the absolute number of H isn't relevant.

Wait, the question says, "elemental abundances", which are usually abundance ratios. So the ratio of Si atoms would be determined by their [Si/H], assuming same H, which might not be the case, but perhaps the problem expects us to proceed as if H is the same.

Thus, the ratio would be 10^0.6 → ~3.98, which is ~4. So option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance relative to H is solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 (since [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg abundance relative to H is solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 (derived from [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]).

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH)_sun = -5.

### Analysis:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\left([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2\right)}.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 = 0.3\),
- \([{\text{Si/H}}]_2 = -0.3\),

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{(0.3 - (-0.3))} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **4**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is closest to **3.9**.
