Okay, so I've got this question here about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm supposed to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric tensor, I think.

Wait, the gamma matrices have mass dimension, right? Let me recall: the gamma matrices γ^μ are dimensionless in four-dimensional spacetime because they're just matrices, not operators with derivatives. So each γ is [γ^μ] = 0.

Now, looking at the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. Let's break that down. ψ is a Dirac spinor, so its mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is (∂ / + m)ψ = 0, so ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄, being the adjoint, also has dimension 3/2.

The σ_{μν} involves [γ_μ, γ_ν], each γ has dimension 0, so σ_{μν} is dimension 0 as well. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimensions 3/2 + 3/2 = 3? Wait, because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is 0, so adding them gives 3.

Now, the F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I believe. F^{μν} has mass dimension 2. Because F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. So ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ gives each term a dimension of 1 + 1 = 2.

So putting it all together, the term L_int is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. The dimensions of (ψ̄ σ ψ) F would be 3 (from the fermion part) plus 2 (from F) equals 5. So the whole Lagrangian term has dimension 5, and since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (because in four dimensions, action is dimensionless, and integral of Lagrangian density is action, so Lagrangian density has dimension 4), we can find the dimension of κ.

So [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1. Because [L] = [κ] + [ψ̄σψ F] = [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Wait, but wait, the Lagrangian term is L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the term itself is part of the Lagrangian, so its dimension must be 4. So indeed, [κ] + [ψ̄σψ F] =4 → [κ]=4-5= -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? To check that, we need to see the dimension of κ. Renormalizability depends on the interaction term's dimension. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has positive mass dimension. Because in four dimensions, if the coupling has positive mass dimension, the interaction term is "marginal" or less relevant, making the theory renormalizable.

Wait, wait: the condition for renormalizability is that the coupling constant has [g] ≥ 0. Because the dimension of the coupling must be such that the interaction term doesn't become irrelevant at higher energies.

Wait, no, I think it's that the dimension of the coupling must be such that the interaction term has a dimension less than or equal to 4. Because in the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension 4. So for the term L = g φ^n, the dimension of g would be [g] =4 - n [φ]. If [g] is positive, then the coupling becomes stronger at higher energies, which may lead to problems, but wait, no: I think the condition is that the coupling is dimensionless or has positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait: In four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction requires that the coupling has dimension ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, the interaction becomes irrelevant at high energies, meaning the theory isn't renormalizable.

So in this case, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. Because when you have a coupling with negative dimension, it's like the term is non-renormalizable. So the theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So that's the correct option.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from $\gamma_\mu$ and $\gamma_\nu$, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, as it is derived from the derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$ (which has $[A_\mu] = 1$).
- The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension:
  \[
  [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
  \]
- Including $F^{\mu\nu}$, the full term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension:
  \[
  [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 3 + 2 = 5.
  \]
- The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = 4$ in four spacetime dimensions. Therefore, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is:
  \[
  [\kappa] = [\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] - [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 4 - 5 = -1.
  \]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has non-negative mass dimension ($[g] \geq 0$). In this case, $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. Since the coupling constant has negative mass dimension, the interaction term becomes irrelevant at high energies, and the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
