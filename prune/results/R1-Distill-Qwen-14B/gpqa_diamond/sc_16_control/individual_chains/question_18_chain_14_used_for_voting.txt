Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, let me start by understanding what each piece of information means and what I need to calculate.

First, the problem gives me the masses of the stars. Star_1 is 1.5 times the mass of the Sun, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. But I'm not sure if the masses are directly relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances, which are ratios, so maybe the mass affects other factors, but perhaps not the abundance ratios themselves. I'll keep that in mind and see if it comes into play later.

Next, the elemental abundances determined via the EW method are provided. The notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms relative to the Sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, so magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times the solar ratio.

Then, the [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so magnesium relative to hydrogen in Star_2 is solar. 

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, subtracting 12 gives log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) → which is about 3.16 x 10^-5. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5) → 1e-5.

So, now I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. That is, [nSi/Star1] / [nSi/Star2]. 

Wait, no. Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So, maybe it's the ratio [nSi_1 / nSi_2] or [nSi_1 / nH_1] divided by [nSi_2 / nH_2]? Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." Hmm. So, I think it's (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2). Because that would give (nSi_1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2) ) = (nSi1 * nH2) / (nSi2 * nH1). Alternatively, sometimes ratios are presented as [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. 

But perhaps another approach is to compute the [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

Wait, let's see. Let me outline the steps.

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = Fe/Sun * Sun/H → but wait, [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H/Fe_Sun/H_Sun) )=0 → Fe/H = Fe_Sun / H_Sun → same as solar.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun) → because [X/Y] = log( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

Wait, so [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun ) = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

Similarly for Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H = Mg_Sun / H_Sun.

So, I can compute [Si/H] for each star, then find the ratio.

Wait, because the question is about the ratio of silicon in each star, perhaps I need to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take their ratio: ([Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2) = (nSi_1 /nH1) / (nSi_2 /nH2) ) → which is (nSi_1 * nH2) / (nH1 * nSi_2 ).

Wait, but nH is the number of hydrogen atoms, which should be the same in each star's photosphere if they're in LTE and the same temperature? Wait, not necessarily, but perhaps the H abundance is the same as solar? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_1 is zero, which means Fe/H is the same as solar. So, if [Fe/H] is zero, then Fe/Sun = H/Sun → Fe/H = (Fe/Sun) / (H/Sun) = 1 → same as Sun. So, the ratio Fe/H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is zero → Mg/H same as Sun.

But I'm not sure about the H abundance in each star. Wait, in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ionization balance and other factors are considered. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen number density is the same in each star as in the Sun? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives us the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are zero, so Fe and Mg are at solar abundance. But how about other elements like Si?

Wait, let me think about how to get [Si/H] for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → so Fe/H is solar. So, Fe/H = Fe_Sun / H_Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun).

So, let me compute Si/H in Star_1.

(Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun)
→ (Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe/H)_1

But (Fe/H)_1 is solar, so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe_Sun / H_Sun).

So,

(Si/H)_1 = [10^0.3 * (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun)] * (Fe_Sun / H_Sun) ) 
= 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun / H_Sun) )

Because (Fe_Sun cancels out.)

But (Si_Sun / H_Sun) is the solar ratio. So, (Si_Sun / H_Sun) = 10^(-4.5) → because Sun's log(nFe/nH) is 7.5, but wait, what about Si?

Wait, I don't have the solar abundance for Si. The Sun's composition gives nFe and nMg, but not Si. Hmm.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? I don't have that. So I can't compute [Si/H] directly. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find [Si/H] using the given [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] values.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

And [Fe/H]_1 =0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe_Sun)/(H_Sun).

So, (Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe/H)_1 = [10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun] * [Fe_Sun / H_Sun] 

= 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun * (Fe_Sun / H_Sun)

But (Si/Fe)_sun = (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun)

So,

(Si/H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun) * (Fe_Sun / H_Sun ) 

= 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun / H_Sun )

Which is 10^0.3 times the solar Si/H ratio.

Wait, but I don't know the solar Si/H ratio. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe we can express it in terms of Mg, which we have.

Wait, perhaps using the [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the [Si/H] for each star in terms of the Sun's values.

But without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], how can I proceed? Because I only have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the Sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H] using the given data for Star_2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can relate the two stars through their abundances.

Wait, let me think about Star_2 first.

For Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg_Sun / H_Sun).

So,

(Si/H)_2 = (Mg/Si)_2^{-1} * (Mg/H)_2

= [10^(-0.3) * (Mg_Sun/Si_Sun)] * [Mg_Sun / H_Sun ]

Wait, wait. Let's compute that step by step.

(Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg_Sun/Si_Sun) → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg_Sun/Si_Sun) → so (Si/Mg)_2 = 10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun/Mg_Sun).

But to find (Si/H)_2, perhaps it's better to write (Si/Mg)_2 * (Mg/H)_2.

Because (Si/H)_2 = (Si/Mg) * (Mg/H).

So,

(Si/H)_2 = (Si/Mg)_2 * (Mg/H)_2

= [10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun/Mg_Sun)] * [Mg_Sun / H_Sun ]

= 10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun / Mg_Sun) * (Mg_Sun / H_Sun )

= 10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun / H_Sun )

So, (Si/H)_2 is 10^(-0.3) times the solar Si/H ratio.

Wait, but (Si_Sun / H_Sun) is the same as [Si/H]_sun.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = 10^0.3 * [Si/H]_sun.

Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = 10^(-0.3) * [Si/H]_sun.

So the ratio [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2 = [10^0.3 * [Si/H]_sun ] / [10^(-0.3) * [Si/H]_sun ] = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which rounds to about 3.98, so approximately 4. So the ratio is around 4.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2.

So, the ratio is about 4, which is option A) ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent signs.

Wait, let me recheck. For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 =10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

So,

(Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe/H)_1.

But (Fe/H)_1 is 0, so same as Sun → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe_Sun / H_Sun).

So,

(Si/Fe)_sun = (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun).

Thus,

(Si/H)_1 = (10^0.3 * (Si_Sun/Fe_Sun)) ) * (Fe_Sun / H_Sun )

= 10^0.3 * (Si_Sun / H_Sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg_Sun/Si_Sun).

We can write (Si/Mg)_2 =10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun/Mg_Sun).

Then,

(Si/H)_2 = (Si/Mg)_2 * (Mg/H)_2.

(Mg/H)_2 is solar → (Mg_Sun / H_Sun).

So,

(Si/H)_2 = (10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun/Mg_Sun)) ) * (Mg_Sun / H_Sun )

= 10^(-0.3) * (Si_Sun / H_Sun )

So, [Si/H]_1 is 10^0.3 times the solar value, and [Si/H]_2 is 10^(-0.3) times solar.

So, their ratio is [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2 = (10^0.3 * solar) / (10^(-0.3) * solar) ) = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, so about 4. So the ratio is ~3.9, which is option A.

So the answer should be A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = Solar ratio.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = \(10^{0.3} \times (\text{Si/Fe})_{\odot}\).

   Using \( (\text{Si/H})_1 = (\text{Si/Fe})_1 \times (\text{Fe/H})_1 \), and since \( (\text{Fe/H})_1 = (\text{Fe/H})_{\odot} \), we find:
   \[
   (\text{Si/H})_1 = 10^{0.3} \times (\text{Si/H})_{\odot}.
   \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H = Solar ratio.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( (\text{Mg/Si})_2 = 10^{0.3} \times (\text{Mg/Si})_{\odot} \).

   Using \( (\text{Si/H})_2 = (\text{Si/Mg})_2 \times (\text{Mg/H})_2 \), and since \( (\text{Mg/H})_2 = (\text{Mg/H})_{\odot} \), we find:
   \[
   (\text{Si/H})_2 = 10^{-0.3} \times (\text{Si/H})_{\odot}.
   \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
   \[
   \frac{(\text{Si/H})_1}{(\text{Si/H})_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \times (\text{Si/H})_{\odot}}{10^{-0.3} \times (\text{Si/H})_{\odot}} = 10^{0.3 + 0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Approximating \( 10^{0.6} \), we get \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), or approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
