Okay, let's see. I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator and also calculate the average value of that operator. Hmm, the question seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.

So, the state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means we might have to normalize it. Because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes, right?

First, I should probably write the state vector properly. The state |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, which I know are the standard basis states for spin-½ systems. So, |up> is (1, 0) and |down> is (0, 1) in the computational basis.

Let me write |alpha> as a vector. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i), but since it's proportional, I need to normalize it. The normalization factor is the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So, the coefficients are c1 = 1 + i and c2 = 2 - i. Let me compute their magnitudes.

|c1|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
|c2|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so I think that's correct.

Next, the operator whose matrix is given by A_ij. The elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, that would make the diagonal zeros and the off-diagonal elements hbar/2.

So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0     ]

Is that right? Because for i not equal j, the elements are hbar/2.

So this operator is actually (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, maybe? Because the Pauli X swaps the basis states. Wait, the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, our A is (hbar/2) σ_x.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of eigenstates. Because the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of this operator. So, if I can find the eigenstates of A, then the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the components when the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of those eigenstates.

Alternatively, another approach is to diagonalize the operator A. Because then, the eigenstates are the basis where measurements are straightforward.

So, let me diagonalize matrix A.

The matrix A is:

[0 hbar/2]
[hbar/2 0 ]

This is a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

To find the eigenvalues, let's solve the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So, the determinant of [ -λ    hbar/2 ]
                [ hbar/2  -λ ]

Which is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

So, λ² = (hbar²/4), so λ = hbar/2 and λ = -hbar/2.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar^2/4) = 0. So, λ² = hbar²/4 ⇒ λ = ± hbar/2.

Hmm, so the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the initial matrix isn't diagonal because it's off-diagonal elements are non-zero. So, the eigenstates are the states that are either |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X operator.

Wait, because the Pauli X has eigenvalues +1 and -1 with eigenstates |+x> and |-x>. So, since our operator A is (hbar/2)σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, and the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ± hbar/2.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are given by (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, let me confirm that. The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2)

But wait, in our case, the basis is |up> (which is like |0>) and |down> (like |1>), so yes, the eigenstates would be as I wrote.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, now I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Once I have the coefficients, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes.

So, let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

To find a and b, we can express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>, then substitute.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But from earlier, |alpha> is (1+i)|up>/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)|down>/sqrt(7).

So, equating coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i ) / sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i ) / sqrt(7)

So, we have two equations:

1. (a + b) = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
2. (a - b) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Let me write these as:

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

I can add and subtract these equations to find a and b.

Adding the two equations:

2a = [ (1 + i ) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7)
= (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, adding: (a + b) + (a - b) = 2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
So numerator: 1+ i + 2 -i = 3. So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the first:

(a + b) - (a - b) = 2b = [ (1 + i ) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7)
So 2b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7)
Therefore, b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) / 2

So, now we have a and b.

Now, the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

Compute |a|²:

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7))
So |a|² = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7) ) = (18) / (28) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 0.61, which is 0.61, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computation.

Wait,

Wait a is (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|² = [ (3^2) * (sqrt(2))^2 ) ] / [ (2^2) * (sqrt(7))^2 ) ]
= (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7)
= 18 / 28 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Which is approximately 0.643. So about 0.64.

Similarly, let's compute |b|².

b = ( (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ) / 2.

So |b|² is [ | -1 + 2i |² * (2/7) ] / (4 )

Wait, let me compute | -1 + 2i |²: that's (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

So |b|² = (5 * (2/7)) ) /4 = (10/7) /4 = 10/(28) =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 5/14, which is approximately 0.357. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. Wait 0.64 +0.36 =1, but 9/14 is about 0.642, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So option A's first two would be 0.64 and 0.36, which is close.

But let me check other options. Option D gives 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't sum to 1. Wait, no, wait, no, wait, the other options are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

But wait, the sum of 0.64 and 0.36 is 1, so that's acceptable. But our calculation gives a 9/14 and 5/14, which are 0.642857 and 0.357.

So, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

But looking at the options, only option A has 0.64 as the first probability. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but 5/14 is 0.357, which is approximately 0.36, so option A's first two match.

Wait, but let me double-check whether the probabilities are correctly computed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I expanded the state |alpha>.

Alternative approach: Since the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, the probabilities are the square of the projections of |alpha> onto these states.

So, the probability P(+x) is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for P(-x).

So, compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is ( ⟨ up | + ⟨ down | ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * ⟨ up | up ⟩ + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * ⟨ down | up ⟩ ] * 1/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait, better to compute it as:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ⟨ up | alpha ⟩ + ⟨ down | alpha ⟩ ]

⟨ up | alpha ⟩ = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
⟨ down | alpha ⟩ = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Simplify numerator: (1+i + 2 -i ) = 3.

So, < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability P(+x) is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

< -x | is ( ⟨ up | - ⟨ down | ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< -x | alpha > = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Compute numerator: (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So, < -x | alpha > = (-1 +2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is | (-1 +2i) |^2 /14.

| -1 +2i |^2 = 1 +4 =5.

So P(-x)=5/14 ≈0.357.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking back at the options, option A: 0.64, 0.36, etc.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Next, find the average value of the operator A. The expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

But since A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2 with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, the expectation value would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

So,

= (9/14)(hbar/2) - (5/14)(hbar/2)
= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2)
= (4/14) * (hbar/2)
= (2/7) (hbar/2 )
Wait, wait, 4/14 is 2/7. So,

= (2/7) * (hbar/2) ) = (2 hbar) / (14 ) ) = hbar /7.

Wait, that's the expectation value.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So option A's third part matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct option should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches.

But wait, what about the other options? Let me check.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46. That sums to 1, but that's not matching our probabilities.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72. No, that's opposite.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29. Doesn't sum to 1.

Wait, wait, 0.61 + 0.29 is 0.9, which is less than 1. So that can't be correct.

Wait, but in our calculation, the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.642857) and 5/14 (≈0.357).

Which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which matches, and the average is hbar/7. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but looking back, let me recheck the expectation value calculation.

Alternative approach: expectation value of A is the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So,

E = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [9/14 -5/14 ] * hbar/2
= (4/14) * hbar/2
= (2/7) * hbar/2
= (2 * hbar) / (14 )
= hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. So in the options, the closest is option A, which lists 0.64 and 0.36.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, the total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), and the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle.
\]

Expanding \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) in the \( |\uparrow\rangle, |\downarrow\rangle \) basis, we substitute into the expression for \( |\alpha\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + a \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle + b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle - b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Equating coefficients with \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle \), we solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
a + b = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \sqrt{2}, \quad a - b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \sqrt{2}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations:

\[
2a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad a = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

\[
2b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) with probabilities \( \frac{9}{14} \) and \( \frac{5}{14} \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \) match **Option A**.
