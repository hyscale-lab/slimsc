Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves the scattering of particles where they don't lose any kinetic energy, right? But wait, the question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, which can be expressed in terms of phase shifts.

The given phase shifts are δ_0 = 90°, δ_1 = 67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, and δ_4=13°. And the rest are ignored. So, I think phase shifts are important in partial wave expansions. Each phase shift corresponds to a different angular momentum state, like l=0,1,2,3,4...

The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) in the partial wave expansion is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cos θ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That would be when θ=0 degrees. So cos θ is 1, right?

Wait, but wait, for θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l. Because P_l(1)=1 for any l. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are all 1. So the sum simplifies because each term's P_l(1) is 1.

So the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) would be (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] * 1. Then, the sum is over l=0 to 4, since higher phase shifts are ignored.

Wait, but I need to find the imaginary part of f(θ=0). Let me denote f = f_real + i f_imaginary. So, the imaginary part of f would be the coefficient of i in the expression.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Let me compute this term for each l.

Wait, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when I multiply e^{i δ_l} by sin δ_l, I get [cos δ_l * sin δ_l] + i [sin^2 δ_l]. So each term contributes a real part and an imaginary part.

But since f is (1/k) times the sum of all these terms, the imaginary part of f (f_imag) is (1/k) times the sum over l of (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l.

Because the imaginary part comes from the i sin^2 δ_l term.

So f_imag = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

But wait, what is k? k is the wave number, which is sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, E is given as 50 MeV. Hmm, but I think in particle physics, the expression for k might be in terms of the wavelength or using natural units.

Wait, let me think. The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But E is 50 MeV, which is a large energy. To compute k in units compatible with femtometers, I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, since we're dealing with scattering in nuclear physics, the target is a nucleus, and electrons are being scattered. The mass m is the mass of the electron, right? Because the electrons are the ones moving and being scattered. So m = mass of electron.

So m_e = 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg.

But let's think about E. E is 50 MeV. To convert that into joules, 1 eV is 1.602176634 ×10^-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV, so 50e6 eV. So E = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01088e-13 J.

But wait, the units for k would be in m^-1. So let's compute k.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ

Wait, ħ is hbar, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's compute numerator first: sqrt(2 * m_e * E).

m_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg

E = 50 MeV = 8.01088e-13 J

So 2 * m_e * E = 2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-13 J.

Calculating that: 2 * 9.10938356e-31 = 1.8218767e-30

Multiply by 8.01088e-13: 1.8218767e-30 * 8.01088e-13 = approx 1.46e-42 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so kg * J is kg² m² / s². Hmm, taking square root would give kg m / s.

Which is (kg m/s) = N s / m (since N = kg m/s², so N s = kg m/s), but I'm not sure, perhaps better to see units for k.

Wait, k has units of 1/m. Let me think again.

We have k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

Wait, m_e is in kg, E is in joules.

2 m_e E has units kg * (kg m²/s²) ) = kg² m²/s².

Taking the square root gives kg m/s.

Divide by ħ (unit J s = kg m²/s), so (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = 1/(m) → so k is indeed 1/m.

So now compute the numerical value.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-13 J)

Let me compute 2 m_e E:

2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-13 J = 2 * 9.10938e-31 * 8.01088e-13.

Calculating 9.10938e-31 * 8.01088e-13 ≈ 7.298e-43.

Multiply by 2: 1.4596e-43.

Take sqrt: sqrt(1.4596e-43) ≈ 3.823e-21.5? Wait, because sqrt(1e-43) is 1e-21.5.

Wait 1e-43 is (1e-21.5)^2. So sqrt(1.4596e-43) ≈ 3.823e-21.5 meters^−1? Wait, no, wait, because kg*m/s gives sqrt(kg^2 m^2/s^2) → kg m/s, but when we take the sqrt(2 m_e E), which has units kg m/s, divided by ħ (kg m²/s), the units are (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = 1/m.

So the value is approximately 3.823e-22 m^-1? Wait, no, wait: 2 m_e E is in kg^2 m²/s², sqrt is kg m/s. Then dividing by ħ (kg m²/s), gives (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = 1/(m). So yes, the units are in 1/m.

Wait, let me compute the exact value.

Compute 2 m_e E:

2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-13 J.

= 2 * 9.10938356e-31 * 8.01088e-13

= 2 * (9.10938356 * 8.01088) * 1e-44

9.10938356 * 8.01088 ≈ 72.999 (approximately 73).

So 2 * 73 ≈ 146.

So 146e-44 → 1.46e-42.

Wait, no, wait: 9.10938356e-31 * 8.01088e-13 = let's compute 9.10938356 * 8.01088 ≈72.9999.

So 72.9999 * 1e-31-13 = 72.9999e-44 = 7.29999e-43.

Multiply by 2: 14.59998e-43 → 1.459998e-42.

So sqrt(1.459998e-42) = sqrt(1.459998) * 1e-21.

√1.459998 is about 1.208 (since 1.2^2=1.44, 1.208^2 ≈1.459)).

So sqrt ≈ 1.208e-21 m^-1.

Divide by ħ: ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (1.208e-21 m^-1) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) )? Wait, no, wait, the numerator is sqrt(2 m_e E) which is in kg m/s, and denominator is ħ in J s (kg m²/s). So the units are (kg m/s)/(kg m²/s) )= 1/m, which is correct.

Wait, but the numerator was sqrt(2 m_e E) = 1.208e-21 m/s, and the denominator is ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = (1.208e-21 m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s) )

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the units would be (m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = 1/(kg m) ), which is not correct. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Since E is given in MeV, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers, using natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, because in particle physics, the relation ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm is often used. So, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum k in inverse femtometers.

The energy E is related to the momentum by E = (ħ c k )^2 / (2 m_e c^2).

Wait, but let me think again. The relativistic energy relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. For non-relativistic speeds, E ≈ p^2/(2m) + m c^2. But since the electron is moving at 50 MeV, which is much higher than its rest mass (about 0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, maybe I should use the relativistic relation.

But perhaps for the given problem, they're expecting me to use the non-relativistic approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the relation k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ, E in Joules.

Alternatively, since the energy is 50 MeV, and the mass of the electron is about 0.5 MeV/c², so E is about 100 times the rest mass. So relativistic effects are important, but perhaps the question is expecting a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute k in terms of inverse femtometers, given that 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

But perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute k in units of inverse femtometers.

We can use the formula:

k (fm^{-1}) = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ

But since E is in MeV, and ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm, perhaps I can express k in terms of E.

Wait, let's compute k in terms of MeV and ħ c.

We have:

E = (ħ c k)^2 / (2 m_e c^2 )

Wait, solving for k:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E c^2) / (ħ c )

But perhaps a better approach is to use natural units where ħ = c = 1.

In natural units, E (MeV) = (k (fm^{-1}))^2 * (197.33 MeV fm)^2 / (2 m_e c^2) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to compute k in terms of 1/fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (1/(2k)) times the sum of (2l+1) sin 2δ_l, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, earlier I thought f_imag is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, let me think again. The partial wave expansion is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

But e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l )

= i sin² δ_l + i sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Wait, no: e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ.

So, e^{i δ} sin δ = (cos δ + i sin δ) * sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So when you multiply by (2l+1) and sum over l, the real part comes from the first term, and the imaginary part comes from the second term.

Therefore, the imaginary part of f is (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ].

Yes, that's what I concluded earlier.

So, the imaginary part f_imag = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So, I need to compute this sum, then multiply by 1/k.

So first, compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Let's list the l values from 0 to 4.

l=0: δ_0=90°, which is π/2 radians.

sin(90°)=1, so sin²(90)=1.

(2*0 +1)=1.

So term is 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: δ_1=67°, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205; sin²≈0.8473.

(2*1+1)=3.

Term: 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: δ_2=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192; sin²≈0.6710.

(2*2+1)=5.

Term: 5 * 0.6710 = 3.355.

l=3: δ_3=30°, sin(30)=0.5; sin²=0.25.

(2*3+1)=7.

Term:7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4: δ_4=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495; sin²≈0.05058.

(2*4+1)=9.

Term: 9 * 0.05058 ≈ 0.4552.

Now sum all these terms:

1 (l=0) 

+2.5419 (l=1) → 3.5419

+3.355 (l=2) → 6.8969

+1.75 (l=3) → 8.6469

+0.4552 (l=4) → 9.1021.

So the sum S ≈ 9.1021.

So f_imag = (1/k) * 9.1021.

Now, compute k.

As I tried earlier, perhaps using the natural unit approach would be easier.

The relation is:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

But E is 50 MeV. But to compute this, I'll need to convert E into Joules, as earlier, but perhaps there's a more straightforward way.

Wait, another approach: in particle physics, the relation between the momentum (k) and the energy (E) is given by E = (ħ c k)^2 / (2 m_e c^2) + m_e c^2.

But since E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c^2 (0.511 MeV), we can approximate E ≈ (ħ c k)^2/(2 m_e c^2).

So,

k = sqrt(2 m_e c^2 E) / ħ c.

But let's compute this.

We can plug in the constants:

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

m_e c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV.

E =50 MeV.

So,

k (fm^{-1}) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV *50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV·fm )

Compute numerator inside sqrt: 2 * 0.511 *50 = 2 *25.55 =51.1.

So sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 (since 7^2=49, 7.15^2 ≈51.12).

Thus, k ≈7.15 /197.33 fm^{-1}.

Compute 7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because 1/fm is 1e15 m^{-1}, but the units here are in fm^{-1}.

Wait, but let me think again. The units for k should be in inverse femtometers (fm^{-1}).

So k ≈ 7.15 / 197.33 → 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈ 27.617 fm.

Wait, 1/0.0362 is approximately 27.617.

So then f_imag = 9.1021 * 27.617 fm.

Wait, wait, no. Because f_imag is (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

But 1/k is (fm) because k is in fm^{-1}.

So f_imag = (9.1021) * (1/k) → 9.1021 * 27.617 fm ≈ 251.8 fm.

Wait, 9.1021 * 27.617:

Let me compute 9 *27.617 = 248.553.

0.1021 * 27.617 ≈ 2.825.

Total ≈251.378 fm.

Looking at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, so option D is 251.271 fm, which is very close to my approximate calculation of 251.378 fm. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations of the sine terms and the exact value of k.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of the sum S.

Let me recalculate each term with more precise sine values.

Compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l:

l=0: δ=90°, sin^2=1. Term: 1*1=1.

l=1: δ=67°, sin(67) ≈ 0.92050485345, so sin^2≈0.847323785. (2+1)=3 → 3 * 0.847323785 ≈2.541971356.

l=2: δ=55°, sin(55)=0.81915204428, sin^2≈0.671022294. (2*2+1)=5 →5 * 0.671022294≈3.35511147.

l=3: δ=30°, sin(30)=0.5, sin^2=0.25. Term:7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ=13°, sin(13)=0.22495105430, sin^2≈0.050583831. (2*4+1)=9 →9 * 0.050583831≈0.455254479.

Sum all terms:

1 + 2.541971356 = 3.541971356.

+3.35511147 →6.897082826.

+1.75 →8.647082826.

+0.455254479 →9.102337305.

So sum S ≈9.102337305.

Compute k again more accurately.

Using the formula:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c )

But since E =50 MeV, and using ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express E in terms of (ħ c)^2/(m_e c^2) unit.

Wait, perhaps the formula can be written as:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But E must be in Joules for SI units.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute k in terms of 1/fm using the formula:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E (MeV)) / (197.33 MeV·fm) )

Wait, let me think in terms of units.

E in MeV,

ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm,

m_e in MeV/c² (since m_e c²=0.511 MeV).

So,

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c )

But m_e in units of MeV/c², E in MeV.

So,

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²,

So,

sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV ) = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50) MeV^(3/2)/c.

Wait, units are getting a bit messy. Let me compute the numerical value.

Compute 2 *0.511 *50 = 2*0.511=1.022, *50=51.1.

So sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15.

So,

k = 7.15 MeV^(3/2) / (c * (197.33 MeV·fm) )

Wait, but units need to cancel. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't the best. Let me try another way.

Alternatively, using the formula:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV.

But m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e = (0.511 MeV)/(c²).

Putting it into the equation:

k = sqrt(2 * (0.511 MeV/c²) * 50 MeV) ) / ħ.

= sqrt( 2 * 0.511 *50 * (MeV)^2 / c² ) / ħ.

= sqrt( 51.1 (MeV)^2 / c² ) / ħ.

= (sqrt(51.1) MeV / c ) / ħ.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV^{1/2}.

So,

k = (7.15 MeV^{1/2} / c ) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm) / (c) )

Wait, because ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c.

Wait, I think this is getting too tangled. Perhaps it's easier to compute k using the relation:

k (fm⁻¹) = ( sqrt(2 m_e E) ) / (ħ c )

But using units where E is in MeV, m_e in MeV/c², and ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

m_e c² =0.511 MeV → m_e =0.511 MeV/c².

So,

2 m_e E = 2 * (0.511 MeV/c²) *50 MeV = 51.1 (MeV)^2 / c².

sqrt(51.1) MeV^(1) / c → 7.15 MeV / c.

Then,

k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) 

Because ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm → ħ c = (197.33 MeV fm) 

So,

k = (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (c / fm )

Wait, perhaps the unit analysis is getting too complicated. Let me just compute the numerical value.

So,

k = 7.15 / 197.33 → approximately 0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈27.62 fm.

So f_imag = 9.102337305 * 27.62 fm ≈ approx 251.3 fm.

Looking at the options, D is 251.271 fm, which matches closely.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i \delta_l} \sin \delta_l P_l(\cos \theta),
\]

where \(k\) is the wave number, \(\delta_l\) are the phase shifts, and \(P_l(\cos \theta)\) are the Legendre polynomials. For \(\theta = 0\), \(P_l(1) = 1\) for all \(l\), simplifying the expression to:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i \delta_l} \sin \delta_l.
\]

The imaginary part of \(f(0)\), denoted as \(f_{\text{imag}}(0)\), is given by:

\[
f_{\text{imag}}(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum \(\sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l\)
The phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), compute \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l\):

- \(l=0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
- \(l=1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419\),
- \(l=2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355\),
- \(l=3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
- \(l=4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.05058 = 0.4552\).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4552 \approx 9.1021.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is given by:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2 m_e E}}{\hbar},
\]

where \(m_e\) is the electron mass, \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\). Using natural units and approximations, \(k\) is calculated as:

\[
k \approx \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \cdot 50 \, \text{MeV}}}{197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}} \approx \frac{\sqrt{51.1}}{197.33} \approx \frac{7.15}{197.33} \approx 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, \(1/k \approx 27.62 \, \text{fm}\).

### Step 3: Compute \(f_{\text{imag}}(0)\)
Using the formula \(f_{\text{imag}}(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l\):

\[
f_{\text{imag}}(0) = 9.1021 \cdot 27.62 \, \text{fm} \approx 251.3 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated value is:

**D) 251.271 fm**

Answer: D
