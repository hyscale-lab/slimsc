Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what symmetries are those?

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. I need to figure out which ones must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, let me think. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're effective for. The Standard Model (SM) has certain symmetries, so SMEFT should respect those as well. But what are those?

I remember that the SM respects Lorentz symmetry. Because all the particles are described in a Lorentz-invariant way, right? So any operators in SMEFT must also be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, wait, but in a field theory, all the interactions are local, so they should respect Poincare. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it should include all the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincare. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, must also be respected. So both 1 and 2 would be correct.

Wait, but wait! I think some people might confuse Lorentz and Poincare. Poincare is bigger, including translations. But in the SMEFT, all operators must form a Lorentz-invariant theory, and since it's a field theory, it must also respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Then, what about CP and CPT symmetries? I'm a bit fuzzy here. The SM isn't invariant under CP, right? For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either. So option 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily respected. So any choice that includes 3 might be incorrect.

CPT symmetry is a bit different. I remember that the SM respects CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I think that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because of the way the Lorentz group acts on the fields, and the requirement of unitarity, CPT symmetry is automatically enforced. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4), because they respect Lorentz symmetry.

So putting it all together: SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries, and CPT (4). But wait, does Poincare symmetry include Lorentz? Because Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators". Do I have to include both 1 and 2? Or is 2 implying 1?

Wait, the question lists them as separate points. So the question is which of the four must be respected. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. Also, since they're Lorentz-invariant, they must respect CPT. So, which ones are correct?

So looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → Lorentz and Poincare. But CPT is also required, so this can't be the correct answer.

B)3,4 → CP and CPT. No, because Lorentz is needed.

C)1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Oh wait, but does SMEFT require Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations. Well, in field theories, operators are local, so yes, they should respect Poincare. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory, so perhaps the Poincare symmetry is included, but I'm not 100% sure if it's a separate requirement. Alternatively, maybe Lorentz is included in Poincare, so if you have Poincare, you don't need to state Lorentz separately. Hmm, but the question lists them as separate options.

Wait, but the question says, which must be respected by all operators. So I think that the SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But I'm a bit confused because Poincare includes Lorentz. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering "Lorentz symmetry" as a separate symmetry, and Poincare as another. So if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is whether the SMEFT must respect all four, so if the answer includes both 1 and 2, that's correct, but perhaps the SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect Poincare, but only Lorentz. Hmm, no, because field theories are Poincare-invariant.

Wait, another approach: SMEFT is built from all possible operators consistent with the symmetries of the SM. The SM includes Poincare symmetry. So SMEFT must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. So both 1 and 2 are correct. Additionally, CPT is also required because of Lorentz symmetry. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait again. I thought the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, so SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP. So 3 is not a must. So option C is 1,2,4. That makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry as well. This symmetry is automatically included in the structure of field theories.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry either.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry is automatically enforced. Thus, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis:
- Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincaré symmetry (2) are both required, as SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant field theory.
- CPT symmetry (4) is also required due to the Lorentz-invariance of the theory.
- CP symmetry (3) is not required, as the SM already violates CP symmetry.

The correct combination of symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT is **1, 2, and 4**.
