Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about photometric observations of a star with some dark spots and how it's similar to the presence of an exoplanet. I need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots. 

Alright, let's break this down. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The problem says that one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, so the filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Oh, right, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. 

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing the observed brightness to vary. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about the exoplanet's radius relative to the star that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots.

So, I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots and then find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same change.

First, let's think about the star's brightness. The star emits energy according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when parts of the star are cooler (spots), the total emitted light changes as the spots rotate in and out of view.

The brightness variation due to spots is a bit tricky. The spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and then goes away. But since it's only one hemisphere, the maximum effect would be when the spots are fully facing us, and the minimum when they're on the far side. 

Wait, but how does the rotation affect the observed brightness? Let's model it. The change in flux (ΔF) can be found by considering the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. When spots are present, part of the star's surface emits less. The filling factor (f) is 0.2, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4πR²)/2, because it's a hemisphere. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered. So the area of the hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is f * 2πR² = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot has a smaller T, so the flux emitted from spots is F_spot = σT_spot^4. The normal flux from the star's surface (non-spots) is F_star = σTeff^4.

The change in flux when the spots are visible is the difference between the normal flux and the spot flux times the area of the spots. But wait, when spots are on the hemisphere facing us, their contribution is lower. So the total flux when spots are visible is: F_total = F0 - (F0 - F_spot) * (area of spots / area of hemisphere). 

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the difference in the star's flux when the spots are on the visible side versus when they're not. So the maximum dip in brightness would occur when the maximum area of spots is blocking our view.

But wait, the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view. Since the spots cover one hemisphere, when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux. But when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is normal.

Wait no, actually, the star is being observed from the side. When the star rotates, the spots on one hemisphere come into and out of view. So the maximum change in brightness occurs when the spotted side is fully visible. So the dip in brightness would be maximum when the spots are fully in view. 

But wait, the star's total emitted flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is F = F_unspotted_area + F_spotted_area.

The unspotted area is the other hemisphere, which has an area of 2πR². The spotted area is 0.2 of the hemisphere, which is 0.4πR²? Wait, no: the spotted hemisphere has area 2πR², and the filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible surface is the spotted area plus the other hemisphere (unspotted). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, when the star is viewed from the side, the hemisphere that's facing us is either the spotted one or the unspotted one, depending on rotation.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation where the spots are on one hemisphere. The maximum effect on the brightness is when that hemisphere is facing us. Then, the flux would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted hemisphere (which is 2πR² area at Teff) and the spotted area (0.4πR² at T_spot) plus the rest of the hemisphere which is unspotted (1.6πR² at Teff? No, wait, the spotted hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.4πR² is spots, and 1.6πR² is normal. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = (unspotted part of the hemisphere) + (spotted part). Wait, no, the entire spotted hemisphere is 2πR², so when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F = (flux from unspotted part of this hemisphere) + (flux from spotted part of this hemisphere) 

Plus, the flux from the other hemisphere? No, wait, when we look at the star, only the hemisphere facing us is visible. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = (unspotted area on this hemisphere)*F_unspotted + (spotted area on this hemisphere)*F_spotted

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, F_unspotted = (2πR²) * F_unspotted.

Wait, no, the unspotted hemisphere is entirely at Teff. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is (2πR² - 0.4πR²) * F_unspotted + 0.4πR² * F_spotted.

Wait, let's think again. The spotted hemisphere has area 2πR². 20% of this area is spots, so 0.4πR². So when this hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F = (2πR² - 0.4πR²) * (σ * Teff^4) + 0.4πR² * (σ * T_spot^4)

And when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is:

F = 2πR² * (σ * Teff^4)

So the difference in flux (ΔF) between these two cases is:

ΔF = [ (2πR² - 0.4πR²) * σTeff^4 + 0.4πR² σ T_spot^4 ] - [ 2πR² σ Teff^4 ]

Simplify this:

= ( (1.6 π R²) σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 ) - 2 π R² σ Teff^4 )

= (1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 ) - 2 π R² σ Teff^4

= ( -0.4 π R² σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 )

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ ( -Teff^4 + T_spot^4 )

So ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )

But wait, that's the change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the change in brightness (the dip) is proportional to this ΔF.

Wait, but in reality, the star's brightness when the spots are visible is lower than when they're not. So the dip in brightness is the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted.

Wait, no, the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, no, when the spots are visible (the spotted hemisphere is facing us), F_spotted is less than F_unspotted (when the other hemisphere is facing us). So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, but in the calculation above, F_spotted = F when the spotted hemisphere is visible. And F_unspotted is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

So the dip would be F_unspotted - F_spotted = ΔF.

Wait, earlier I calculated ΔF as F_spotted - F_unspotted, but that would be negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value. Let me recast.

Let me compute F_unspotted and F_spotted and find the difference.

F_unspotted = 2πR² * σ Teff^4

F_spotted (when the spotted hemisphere is visible) = [ (2πR² - 0.4πR²) * σ Teff^4 ] + [ 0.4πR² * σ T_spot^4 ]

= 1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted = (2πR² σ Teff^4) - (1.6πR² σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 )

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 

= 0.4 π R² σ Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 

= 0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the dip is proportional to this. Now, the relative change in brightness (ΔF / F0 ), where F0 is the normal flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, F0 is F_unspotted, which is 2πR² σ Teff^4. 

So relative dip is (ΔF) / F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [2 Teff^4 ]

= (0.4 / 2) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

= 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Calculating (5000/6000)^4: 5/6 is approx 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about (0.8333)^2 = ~0.6944, then squared again, ~0.48225. So 1 - 0.48225 is 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355. So about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but wait, that's the maximum dip. However, because the star is rotating, the spots would cause a variation in brightness over time, but the total variation would have an amplitude of about 10% dip. Hmm, but wait, no, the question says the photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotation. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, no, actually, when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower than when it's the unspotted hemisphere. So the variation would be from F_unspotted to F_spotted, which is a dip of approximately 10.35% (as calculated above). The amplitude of the variation is this dip.

Wait, but the star is only showing spots on one hemisphere, so when it rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) comes into view. So the brightness goes from F_spotted to F_unspotted. So the amplitude of the variation is the dip when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the dip is 10.35% of the total brightness. So the amplitude of the light curve is ΔF = 0.1035 F0.

Now, the question is, what radius exoplanet would create the same amplitude in the light curve? So when the exoplanet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light. The dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but the planet would cause a dip of (R_p / R_star)^2. So the dip's amplitude is (R_p / R_star)^2.

We want this dip to be equal to 0.1035 (in terms of F0), so:

(R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, wait, but the star's radius is R_sun, and exoplanets are usually much smaller. Wait, 0.32 R_sun is a very large planet. Jupiter is about 0.1 R_sun. So that would suggest a planet larger than Jupiter, which is possible, but given the options, I need to see what the closest option is.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39 R_sun is even larger than my calculation.

B) ~0.07 → 0.07 R_sun, which is about Earth-sized (Earth is ~0.009 R_sun, so 0.07 is bigger than Earth, maybe a Neptune-like).

C) ~0.11 → ~0.11 R_sun, which is about 11% of the Sun's radius.

D) ~0.32 → around 0.32 R_sun, which is about the same as my calculation.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Oh wait! The spots cause a dip of about 10%, but the planet would cause a dip equal to (R_p / R_star)^2. So in the problem statement, it says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So if the star wasn't spotted, what planet would cause the same dip as the spots do. 

Wait, but the dip caused by the spots is about 10% of the star's brightness. So the planet's dip needs to be 10% too.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So the planet's radius would be ~0.32 times the star's radius.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation of the dip. Because I might have made a mistake in the initial step.

The flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = (1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 )

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ Teff^4.

The dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

F0 is F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ Teff^4.

So the relative dip is (0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 π R² σ Teff^4 ) = (0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 Teff^4 )

= 0.2 * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Teff =6000, T_spot=5000.

(5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(0.8333)^4: let me calculate accurately.

0.8333^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈0.6944.

0.6944^2 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225=0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.10355, so ~10.355% dip.

So the amplitude (dip) is about 0.10355 in relative terms.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 ≈ 0.32. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the dip calculation. Because when the star has spots on one hemisphere, and it's rotating, the brightness variation is between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So the delta is about 10.3%, as we found.

But wait, the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet. But exoplanets cause a dip only when they transit in front of the star, which is a brief event. In the case of spots, the variation is due to rotation, so the brightness oscillates between higher (unspotted) and lower (spotted) values as the star rotates, but the amplitude is the difference between the two.

But in the case of a planet, the dip is only when the planet transits, which is a single dip each orbital period, not a continuous variation.

But the problem says that the photometric time-series would show periodic variations (like spots) that resemble an exoplanet's transit. So we're supposed to match the amplitude, not the shape or duration.

So the dip's amplitude is 10.3%, so the planet's dip should be the same.

So planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1035) R_star ≈ 0.32 R_star.

So option D, which is ~0.32, is the correct answer.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \), and a temperature of \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \). One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. The spots are cooler, with a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots
The star's total flux without spots is given by \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = \left( 1.6 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right) + \left( 0.4 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right),
\]

where \( 1.6 \pi R^2 \) is the unspotted area of the hemisphere, and \( 0.4 \pi R^2 \) is the spotted area. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

\[
F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
\]

The difference in flux between these two cases is:

\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}} = 0.4 \pi R^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right).
\]

The relative brightness variation (amplitude) is:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \pi R^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)}{2 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.482 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.518 \approx 0.1036 \, \text{(or 10.36%)}.
\]

### Step 2: Relate the brightness variation to the exoplanet's radius
An exoplanet transiting in front of the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the square of the radius ratio:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
\]

Setting the exoplanet's amplitude equal to the spotted star's amplitude:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 0.322 \) is **D) ~0.32**.

Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately 0.32.

Answer: D
