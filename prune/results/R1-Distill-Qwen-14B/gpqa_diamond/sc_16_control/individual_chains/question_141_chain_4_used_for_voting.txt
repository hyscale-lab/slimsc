Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to determine how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait. Wait, benzene rings with substituents. Oh, wait, 1-bromo would be at position 1, and 2-d... Wait, maybe that's 2-dimethylamino? Or maybe it's 2-diethylamino? Wait, the formula isn't clear. Wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe the "d" stands for something else. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Oh wait, I think the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes the numbering can be off, but wait, the original is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe I should think of it as 2-dimethylamino? Or maybe it's 2-dimethyl substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so perhaps it's 2-dimethylamino. Wait, no, maybe the "d" is a typo and it's 2-dimethyl, like two methyl groups on the benzene ring at position 2. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So the substituents are at positions 1 (bromo) and 2 (maybe another group). Wait, but in the name, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Maybe the "d" is a mistake, and it's 2-dimethylamino, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Wait, no, that would require more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Or maybe it's a typo and the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for something else, like a deuterium or another substituent. Wait, but in the context of this reaction, perhaps it's more about the substituents directing the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on what NaNH2 in ammonia does. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation (elimination reactions), especially for vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. But wait, in the case of benzene rings, perhaps it's about dehydrohalogenation to form a benzyn intermediate, which can undergo various reactions.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromo-something-benzene. If we have a bromine on the benzene ring, and another substituent that is activating or deactivating, then the reaction with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia might lead to elimination, forming a benzyn (aryne) intermediate. Benzynes are highly strained and can undergo various reactions, like cycloadditions or rearrangements.

Wait, but wait, benzene rings with two substituents, especially in positions that can allow the formation of a triple bond (like adjacent positions), can undergo elimination to form benzyne. For example, 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene, upon treatment with strong base, can lose HCl and form benzyne. But in this case, the substituent is perhaps a strong activating group that allows the elimination.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, perhaps the "d" is a typo and it's 2,4-dimethyl. Or maybe it's 2-methyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-diethylamino, which is a strong activating group, like in the case of aniline. Wait, but diethylamino is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. So if the substituent is a strong activating group at position 2, and the bromine is at position 1, then perhaps the base will abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination and forming a triple bond.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. Benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a substituent (let's say, an amino group) at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, the base could abstract a proton that's alpha to the bromine. So perhaps the hydrogen at position 2 (if it's an activating group) could be abstracted.

Wait no, if the substituent at position 2 is a strong activating group, like OMe or NH2, then the hydrogen adjacent to the Br (positions 1 and 2) would be acidic. So the base would abstract a proton from position 2 (if possible), leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, that would require a good leaving group and a proton that's acidic enough to be abstracted.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a methyl group (like in toluene), then the acidity of the adjacent protons is not very high. So perhaps the reaction would not proceed. But wait, methyl is an activating group, but not as strong as -NH2 or -OH. So under NaNH2 conditions, which is a strong base, perhaps the reaction would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group at position 2. So the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Treating this with NaNH2 in ammonia would lead to elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. That would form benzyne, but only if the substituents are in positions that allow that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me think again. The name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the d could stand for another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Let's assume that, for the sake of moving forward.

If the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then positions 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me) are occupied. Now, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the base will abstract a proton that's adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br- and forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, or 1 and 6 (since it's a ring). Wait, but in benzene, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and so are 1 and 6. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 2 or 1 and 6? Or perhaps this leads to a benzyn intermediate.

Wait, benzynes are usually generated when two adjacent substituents (like X and H) are present, and upon elimination, a triple bond forms. But in this case, if the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the Br is at position 1, and Me groups are at 2 and 4. So, the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. If either of these positions has a substituent that can be eliminated, then elimination could occur.

Wait, but the Me groups are in positions 2 and 4. So, in position 2, we have a Me group and the Br is at position 1. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (which is adjacent to Br at 1), then the Me at position 2 might not be involved in that elimination, but wait, the Me is at position 2. Alternatively, perhaps the Me is in position 2 and 4, which are not adjacent to Br, but wait, the Br is at position 1, so position 2 is adjacent, and position 4 is across from it.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents influence the direction of any possible reaction. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so elimination is likely.

Wait, let's think about another approach. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and we treat it with NaNH2, which is a strong base. Then, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's alpha to the Br. The possible positions for such a proton would be positions 2, 3, 5, or 6. But in this case, position 2 has a methyl group, and position 6 is a CH group.

Wait, but methyl groups are not very acidic; they have a pKa around 45-50. NaNH2 is a very strong base, with a pKa around 35 for the conjugate acid (NH2^- + H+ = NH3, which has a pKa around 35). So, the base is strong enough to abstract protons with pKa lower than ~35. Methylprotons are around 45, which is higher than the base's strength, so the base may not abstract them. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in position 2 is something more acidic. Wait, perhaps it's not a methyl group. Let's think again about the starting material name: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The "d" might be a typo. Maybe it's 2-dimethylamino. So the substituent is -N(CH2CH3)2. A dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, with a lone pair that can donate electrons into the ring. Such a group is ortho/para-directing.

So, if the substituent is a dimethylamino group at position 2, then the structure is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. Now, the substituent is a strong activating group, so the ring is activated. Under strong base conditions, NaNH2, perhaps the base will abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a triple bond (benzyne).

But wait, the dimethylamino group is at position 2, adjacent to the Br at position 1. So, the H adjacent to Br would be at position 2, but that's where the substituent is. Wait, no. The substituent is at position 2, so the adjacent positions are 1 (Br), 3. Hmm, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or position 6.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2, then the possible positions for elimination would be position 1 (Br) and position 2. Wait, but for elimination to occur, the base would abstract a proton that's adjacent to Br, perhaps position 6. Because position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1). So if the base abstracts the proton at position 6, adjacent to Br, then elimination would occur, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

But wait, the substituent is at position 2, so perhaps the ring's structure is such that elimination is possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent in position 2 is a strong activating group, making the ring electron-rich, which may facilitate elimination.

Wait, but if elimination forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, then the benzene ring would have a triple bond there. Then, that benzyne can undergo various reactions, such as cycloadditions or rearrangements. But wait, the question is about the products formed in this reaction, so perhaps the main products are the elimination products.

Wait, but in this scenario, elimination would occur once, forming a single triple bond. But wait, maybe there are multiple sites where elimination can occur, leading to different products. Let me think again.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the Br is at position 1, and there are methyl groups at 2 and 4. So, the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. But in this case, position 2 has a methyl group. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br but not substituted, then elimination would occur between positions 1 and 6, forming a triple bond. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are in positions that don't interfere with the elimination.

Wait, but if elimination occurs between positions 1 and 6, the substituents on positions 2 and 4 would be on the same side of the ring. So, perhaps the product would be a triple bond between 1 and 6, with methyl groups at 2 and 4. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6 would result in a benzene ring with a triple bond between those positions, which is a benzyne structure.

But wait, perhaps the ring isn't flat anymore. Benzynes are typically antiaromatic and highly strained, so they tend to undergo reactions quickly. So, perhaps the reaction forms this benzyne intermediate, which can then react further.

But the question is about the products formed in this reaction. So, if the reaction stops at the benzyne intermediate, that's one product. But if the reaction leads to other products via the benzyne, like dimerization or other cycloadditions, then what happens?

Wait, but the question is simply asking about the number of possible organic products. So perhaps the benzyne is the only product, but that would lead to option B (1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but undergoes some other transformation. Let me think differently. Oh, wait, NaNH2 is also used in dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps in this case, it's a meta director. Wait, but I think the main reaction is elimination to form benzyne.

But perhaps the substituents in positions 2 and 4 (if they are methyl groups) would influence the positions where elimination occurs. Or maybe the substituents are strong enough to prevent elimination in some positions, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in position 2 is a strong activating group, allowing for multiple elimination sites. Wait, but in this case, if the substituent is at position 2, and the Br is at position 1, perhaps the only possible elimination is between positions 1 and 2, but wait, position 2 has the substituent.

Wait, no. Elimination usually occurs when two adjacent atoms have leaving groups or when a base can abstract a proton that's adjacent to a leaving group. So, if the substituent is a methyl group at position 2, then the Br is at position 1. The only adjacent position to Br is position 2 and 6. If position 2 has a methyl, then perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

But wait, that would leave the substituent at position 2 as a methyl group, so the structure after elimination would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, and methyl at 2. But wait, in this case, the base might have abstracted a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br (position 1) and maybe has a hydrogen that's acidic enough. But methyl groups are not very acidic, so maybe the base can abstract that proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a strong activating group, such as a NH2 group, making the adjacent protons more acidic.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's say the substituent is a methyl group at position 2. So the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

When treated with NaNH2, a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br. The possible positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl group; methyl protons are not very acidic. So the base may not abstract those. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 4, but that's not adjacent to Br.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is something else. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So substitution is less likely. So elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms the benzyn intermediate, which can then undergo various additions. But the question is about the products of the reaction, which would be the benzyn and any possible products from its reactions. But if the reaction stops at the elimination step, then only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can undergo different additions, leading to multiple products. For example, benzynes can undergo dimerization to form biphenylene, but that's a separate reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can undergo ring expansion or other rearrangements, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but perhaps the main product is just the benzyn (the aryne), which is one product. So the number of products is 1, which is option B.

But wait, the starting material might have multiple sites for elimination, leading to multiple benzyne structures. For example, if the substituents are such that elimination can occur in more than one position, then multiple products would form.

Wait, but in the structure I'm considering (1-bromo-2-methylbenzene), elimination can only occur in one position, leading to a single benzyne product.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to two different aryne structures, then the number of products would be 2.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the structure. I think I'm stuck on the structure. Let me look up how 1-bromobenzene-2-d is named. Oh wait, perhaps the "d" is a typo, and it's 2-dimethylamino, making the substituent a strong activating group.

If substituent is 2-dimethylamino, then the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Then, the adjacent positions to Br are 2 and 6. Position 2 has the dimethylamino group. So, the base could abstract a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. Alternatively, perhaps the base could abstract a proton from position 2, but the substituent is already a group, so that's unlikely.

Wait, but dimethylamino groups are quite bulky. Would the base have enough access to abstract a proton from position 2? Maybe not. So perhaps the only possible elimination is between positions 1 and 6, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4 as well, making 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylaminobenzene. Then, elimination could occur in more than one position.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck trying to figure out the exact structure. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that elimination leads to a single product.

So, if the reaction leads to the formation of only one product (the benzyn), then the number of products is 1. So the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility is that the benzyn can undergo further reactions, like dimerization, but I think that's a separate step and may not be part of the main reaction conditions. So perhaps the main product is just the benzyn.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely as NaNH2 is a strong base, and elimination is feasible.

Wait, but maybe the reaction doesn't just stop at the benzyn. Benzynes can undergo various cycloadditions, like the Diels-Alder reaction with dienes, but without a diene present, this might not happen. So perhaps only the benzyn is formed, making one product.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent in position 2 allows for more than one site of elimination. For example, if the substituent is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1, perhaps elimination can occur either between 1 and 2 or between 1 and 6, leading to two different benzynes.

Wait, but position 2 has the substituent, so elimination between 1 and 2 would require the substituent to be a leaving group, which it isn't. So only elimination between 1 and 6 is possible, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in position 4, making elimination possible at 1 and 2, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the substituent is such that the benzene ring has more than one possible site for elimination, leading to multiple products. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then Br is at 1, and substituent at 4. Then, elimination could occur between 1 and 2 or between 1 and 6, leading to two different benzynes. So the number of products would be 2, which is option C.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent at position 4 would be meta to the Br. So, perhaps elimination is possible at two different positions, leading to two different products.

So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the substituents are at positions 2 and 4. The Br is at position 1. So, elimination can occur between 1 and 2 (if position 2 has a substituent that can be eliminated; but in this case, it's methyl, which is not a good leaving group), or between 1 and 6. Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to Br, so elimination between 1 and 6 would form a triple bond.

But wait, the substituent at position 4 is a methyl group. So, perhaps the ring is symmetric, leading to the same product regardless of where the elimination occurs. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination can occur between 1 and 2, but that's adjacent to the substituent at 2. If the substituent is a methyl, then perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2's methyl group. Wait, but position 3 is not adjacent to Br, so elimination wouldn't occur there.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the possible products. If the reaction forms a benzyn, how many different structures can form? Each different position of the triple bond would count as a different product.

So, in the case where the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, and the Br is at position 1, elimination could occur between 1 and 2, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 2. Alternatively, elimination could occur between 1 and 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6. Wait, but how would that be possible?

Wait, in benzene, each position is adjacent to two others. So, for elimination to form a triple bond, the substituents must be adjacent to the Br. So, if the Br is at position 1, and substituents are at positions 2 and 4, then elimination can occur between 1 and 2, and between 1 and 6.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2, then the base can abstract a proton from position 2 (but that's where the substituent is), which is unlikely. Or from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. So, elimination between 1 and 6 would form a triple bond, making a benzyn structure. But in that case, the substituent at position 2 would be a methyl group, which would not interfere.

Wait, but benzynes are typically formed when two adjacent substituents are present (like X and H), allowing elimination. In this case, if the substituents are at 2 and 4, which are meta to each other, and Br is at 1, perhaps elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to two different benzynes. Thus, the number of products would be 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 and 4 are such that elimination can only happen in one position, leading to one product.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of the possible products. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and elimination occurs at position 6 (adjacent to Br at 1), then the triple bond forms between 1 and 6. But the substituents are at 2 and 4, which are on the same side of the ring. So the product would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, with methyl groups at 2 and 4.

But if the substituent is at position 2 only, then elimination between 1 and 6 would be the only possibility, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at positions 2 and 6, but that's not indicated in the name. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because the substituent allows for elimination in multiple positions. For example, if the substituent is at position 2 and 4, and Br is at position 1, elimination could occur at position 6 (adjacent to Br) and perhaps at another position, leading to two different products.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for another angle. Let me think about the number of possible products.

If the reaction produces two different benzynes, then the answer would be C) 2. If only one benzyne is formed, then B)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product, but that's unlikely as NaNH2 is a strong base.

Wait, but considering the structure, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a strong activating group, like -NH2, which makes the adjacent position's protons more acidic. So, the base could abstract a proton from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between 1 and 2. But wait, the substituent is at position 2; if the base abstracts a proton from position 2, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 2, but the substituent is already present at position 2.

Hmm, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, the substituent may not allow elimination in that position, so only elimination at position 6 is possible, leading to one product.

Another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a bulky group that prevents elimination in one direction, leading to only one product.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given the options and the context, I'm leaning towards the reaction producing only one product, the benzyn, so the answer is B)1.

But wait, perhaps the reaction forms two different products because of different sites of elimination.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, elimination can occur between positions 1 and 2 (if substituent is at 2) but that's unlikely. Or between 1 and 6, leading to one product. So, one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at positions 2 and 6, making elimination possible at two different positions, leading to two products.

Wait, but the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which doesn't include a substituent at 6. So, perhaps elimination occurs only once, leading to one product.

I think I'm going to have to go with the assumption that the reaction leads to one product, the benzyn. So the answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. The key is to determine how many possible organic products are formed.

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The name "1-bromobenzene-2-d" is ambiguous, but it is assumed to represent a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a substituent at position 2. A plausible interpretation is that the substituent at position 2 is a methyl group, making the structure 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

2. **Reaction with NaNH₂**:  
   NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation (elimination reactions). In this case, the base can abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine atom at position 1, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2 or 1 and 6. This forms a benzyne (aryne) intermediate.

3. **Analysis of Possible Products**:  
   - The bromine atom is at position 1, and the methyl group is at position 2.  
   - The base can abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to the bromine atom at position 1, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.  
   - Elimination between positions 1 and 2 is unlikely because the methyl group at position 2 is not a good leaving group.  
   - There are no other positions on the ring that allow for elimination under these conditions.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The reaction produces a single product, which is the benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. No other elimination sites or products are feasible under the given conditions.

ANSWER: B
