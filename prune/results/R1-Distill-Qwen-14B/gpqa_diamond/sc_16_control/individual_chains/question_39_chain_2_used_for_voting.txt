Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. Each particle is in a system, and when we measure their positions, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics must satisfy the normalization condition. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because probabilities have to add up to 1.

So, the wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, the imaginary part is a constant here. That's a bit odd because usually the wave function is a combination of real and imaginary parts, but it's supposed to be a solution to the Schrödinger equation. Hmm. Wait, maybe the wave function is expressed as a complex function, but the square modulus would take care of the imaginary part.

Wait, but the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. Because the problem states that when measuring, none were found at x<1 or x>3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. So the wave function Ψ(x) must be zero for x <1 and x >3. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me think about this.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, but perhaps that's only valid in the region between x=1 and x=3. Because outside that region, the wave function is zero. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

So the wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the wave function being a complex number is a bit confusing. Normally, I think the wave function is written as a real function multiplied by an exponential (like e^{i...} ), but perhaps in this problem, it's given as a sum or combination of real and imaginary parts.

Wait, but when you square the modulus, the imaginary part contributes. So |Ψ|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real, and 0.5i is imaginary. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

Wait no, wait: (a / sqrt(1+x) ) is real, and the other term is -0.5i, so when you add them, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So the modulus squared is [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + [(-0.5)]².

So |Ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait a second. The wave function must be normalized, so the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |Ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

So the integral is ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So Ψ(x) = A + B i, where A = a / sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5.

The modulus squared is |A + Bi|² = A² + B². So yes, that's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So the integral is a^2 ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Let me calculate each part.

First part: a^2 ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) )= 0.25*(2) )= 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So equation: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )

Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let me compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the setup? Because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function is typically a function that can be written as either real or an exponential, but having a constant imaginary part might not be typical. Alternatively, perhaps I have misinterpreted the wave function.

Wait, another thought: Could it be that the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) * (1 - 0.5i) ? But the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a real term minus an imaginary term. So the expression is a real number plus an imaginary number. So the modulus squared is (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but then the wave function would have a non-zero imaginary part, which is allowed. So the setup is correct.

So the calculation seems correct. a≈0.8485, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \Psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) for \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), and it is zero outside this range. The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, which requires that the integral of \( |\Psi(x)|^2 \) over all space equals 1. 

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\Psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \)

For the first part, the integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second part, the integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

\[
0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.
