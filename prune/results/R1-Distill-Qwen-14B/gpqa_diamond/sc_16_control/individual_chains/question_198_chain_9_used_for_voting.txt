Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the various cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I think I need to make sure I understand what each β represents. Stability constants (formation constants) are for the stepwise formation of complexes. So, β1 is for Co(SCN)_1^+, β2 is Co(SCN)_2^(+) maybe, and so on. Wait, no. Let me think. The formation of each complex is stepwise, so the overall β for each complex would be the product of all β values up to that point. Or wait, no. No, each β is the stepwise stability constant for adding one SCN- ion each time. So for a complex with n SCN- ions, the overall formation constant K is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no. Wait, stability constants can be either cumulative or stepwise. From what I remember, the β given here are the stepwise stability constants. So each β is for adding one more SCN- ion to the previous complex. So for the complex Co(SCN)_n, the overall stability constant K_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but sometimes people use stepwise and sometimes cumulative. So I need to clarify. So, if it's stepwise, each β is the constant for CoX^n+ + X- ↔ CoX^(n+1)+. So for example, β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ (so K1 = β1=9). Then β2 is for CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^(2+) (K2 = β2=40). Similarly, β3 is for adding another SCN^- to form Co(SCN)_3^3+ (β3=63), and β4 is for Co(SCN)_3^3+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4^4+ (β4=16).

Wait, but the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes" are given. Wait, wait. Cobalt(II) is Co^2+. So the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^2+.

Wait, that's a key point. So the charge on the complexes would be different. Let me think: Co^2+ is the starting ion. Each SCN^- is -1. So adding n SCN^- would give a charge of 2+ + n*(-1) = (2 -n)+. For example, n=1 → [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), n=2 → [Co(SCN)2]^0 (charge 0?), wait no. Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - n+). Hmm. Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this right. The complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So total charge is 2+ + n*(-1) = (2 -n)+. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+ → charge +1. For n=2, Co(SCN)_2 → charge 0. For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^−1. For n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^−2. But wait, the problem says β4=16. So that would be for the complex with n=4, but wait, for n=4, the charge would be 2-4 = -2. But that would mean the complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the question is about dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions. So n=2. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be the neutral complex.

So the question is: what percentage of all the Co species (Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-) is the [Co(SCN)_2] complex.

So the problem is to find the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

The approach would be to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations, based on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That's the total Co^2+ plus all the complexes. So [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 1e-2 M.

Hmm. So, to find the percentages, I need to find the concentrations of each complex species, then sum them and find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)_2^0].

But since the problem involves multiple formation steps, perhaps using the equilibrium expressions and mass balance will be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps using the stepwise formation constants to set up the equilibrium.

The approach is to model the system where Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN^- step by step. The total concentration of all Co species is 0.01 M, and the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M.

Wait, but what about the solution. The total concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M. But when forming complexes, the free SCN^- would be less. But since the formation constants are given, perhaps the concentration of free SCN^- can be considered as 0.1 M because the complexes are not consuming too much SCN^-? Or perhaps not. Hmm, maybe we can make an assumption that [SCN^-] is approximately constant because the formation constants are large, so the change in [SCN^-] is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to model this with the given [SCN^-] as a constant.

But, given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the total Co concentration (0.01 M), perhaps [SCN^-] is approximately constant, so we can take it as 0.1 M in all the calculations.

So, given that, let's model each complex formation step.

I think the general approach is to write the equilibria for each complex formation step, and express each concentration in terms of [Co^2+] and the stability constants multiplied by the respective powers of [SCN^-].

Let me denote:

Let [Co^2+] = x

Then,

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * [SCN^-] = β1*β2 * x * (SCN^-)^2 = 9*40 * x*(0.1)^2

Wait, no. Wait, [Co(SCN)_2^0] is formed by [CoSCN^+] + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2^0], with K = β2.

So, the concentration is [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * [SCN^-]

But [CoSCN^+] is β1 * x * [SCN^-], so substituting:

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN^-]) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2^0] * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3^-] * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4.

So, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:

x + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 0.01 M.

Substituting each term in terms of x:

x + (9 * x * 0.1) + (9*40 * x*(0.1)^2) + (9*40*63 * x*(0.1)^3) + (9*40*63*16 * x*(0.1)^4 ) = 0.01.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute each coefficient:

Term 1: x

Term 2: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 → 0.9 x

Term3: 9 *40 = 360 → 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6 → 3.6 x

Term4: 9 *40*63 = 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680 → 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68 → 22.68 x

Term5: 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880 → 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288 → 36.288 x

So the sum:

x + 0.9x + 3.6x + 22.68x +36.288x =0.01.

Adding them up:

(1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288) x = 0.01.

Compute the sum:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So 64.468 x = 0.01 → x= 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So [Co^2+] is approximately 1.551e-4 M.

Now, we need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2^0], which is term3: 3.6 x.

So [Co(SCN)_2^0] =3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈ 5.5836e-5 M.

Wait wait wait, wait a second. Wait, no. No, because the term3 is 3.6 x, but x is [Co^2+] =1.551e-4 M. So 3.6 *1.551e-4 = approximately 5.5836e-5 M.

But wait, that can't be right because when I sum all terms:

x is 1.551e-4,

term2:0.9x ≈ 1.396e-4,

term3:3.6x≈5.5836e-5,

term4:22.68x ≈3.518e-3,

term5:36.288x ≈5.610e-3.

So the sum is:

1.551e-4 +1.396e-4 = 2.947e-4

+5.5836e-5 → 3.505e-4

+3.518e-3 → 3.868e-3

+5.610e-3 → 9.478e-3.

Wait, but the total is supposed to be 0.01 M, but this sums to about 0.009478 M. Hmm, that's about 9.478 mM. But the total is supposed to be 10 mM. So there's missing 0.522 mM. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum.

Sum of coefficients:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct. So 64.468 x =0.01 → x= 0.01/64.468= approx 0.0001551 M.

Wait, let me compute each term with x=1.551e-4:

term1:1.551e-4 → 0.0001551

term2:0.9 *1.551e-4= 0.00013959 → 0.0001396

term3:3.6 *1.551e-4= 0.00055836 → 0.0005584

term4:22.68 * 1.551e-4= 0.003518 → 0.003518

term5:36.288 *1.551e-4= 0.005612 → 0.005612.

Now, sum all terms:

0.0001551 +0.0001396 =0.0002947

+0.0005584 =0.0008531

+0.003518 =0.0043711 

+0.005612 =0.009983.

Hmm, that's about 0.009983 M, which is 9.983 mM, close to 10 mM but a bit less. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the coefficients somewhere. Let me recheck the coefficients.

Wait, let's recompute each term:

Term2: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9 *0.1=0.9 → 0.9x → correct.

Term3:β1 β2=9*40=360 → 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6 → 3.6 x → correct.

Term4:β1 β2 β3=9*40*63 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680 → 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68 → 22.68 x → correct.

Term5:β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880 → 362880*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288 →36.288x.

So the coefficients are correct.

Wait, then why the discrepancy? Because when x is 1.551e-4, the sum is 9.983 mM, but it should be 10 mM. Hmm, perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

Wait, let's compute x with more precision.

x=0.01 /64.468 → exactly, 0.01 ÷64.468.

Let me compute 64.468 * 0.0001551 = 0.01.

Wait, 64.468 * 0.0001551 = ?

Well, 64 * 0.0001551 = 0.0099664,

0.468 *0.0001551 ≈ 0.0000725268,

Total ≈0.0099664 +0.0000725268=0.0100389, which is a bit more than 0.01, but wait, that can't be since 64.468 * x=0.01.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate x more accurately.

x=0.01 /64.468.

Compute 64.468 × x =0.01 → x=0.01 /64.468.

Compute 0.01 /64.468 = approximately 0.000155105 M.

Wait, 64.468 × 0.000155105 → let me compute:

64.468 × 0.0001=0.0064468,

64.468 × 0.00005=0.0032234,

64.468 × 0.0000051= approx 0.000328.

Adding together: 0.0064468 +0.0032234 =0.0096702 +0.000328=0.0099982, which is close to 0.01. So x≈0.000155105 M.

So, let's go back to each term:

term1: x=0.000155105 → 1.55105e-4.

term2: 0.9 *x=0.0001395945.

term3:3.6*x=0.000558378.

term4:22.68*x=0.003518562.

term5:36.288*x=0.00561329.

Now sum all terms:

1.55105e-4 =0.000155105

+0.0001395945 → 0.0002947

+0.000558378 →0.000853078

+0.003518562 →0.00437164

+0.00561329 →0.00998493.

So about 0.00998493 M, which is 9.98493 mM, very close to 10 mM. The small discrepancy is due to rounding, but for our purposes, x is approximately 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the [Co(SCN)_2^0] is term3:3.6 x → 3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈5.5836e-5 M.

Wait, but wait, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the third term. So the percentage is (5.5836e-5 /0.01) *100% →5.5836e-3 →0.55836%?

Wait, that can't be right because that's way too low. But the options are in the 16-42% range. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. No, I think I messed up the way I'm computing the fractions. Because the [Co(SCN)_2^0] is the third term, but perhaps I should compute each concentration and then find the fraction.

Wait, the total Co is 0.01 M, so [Co(Ct)] = sum of all species = 0.01 M.

So the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2^0] is ( [Co(SCN)_2^0 ] / 0.01 ) *100%.

So [Co(SCN)_2^0] is 3.6 x → x=1.551e-4, so 3.6 *1.551e-4 =5.5836e-5 M.

So 5.5836e-5 / 0.01 = 0.0055836 → 0.55836% → 0.56%. But the options are much higher. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Let me re-examine my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I modeled the formation of the complexes. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each step is cumulative and use the cumulative stability constants.

Wait, another approach is to consider the formation of each complex as a cumulative process. So K1=β1=9, K2=β1β2=9*40=360, K3=β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680, and K4=β1β2β3β4=22680*16=362880.

But wait, no. Wait, for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the cumulative formation constant is K_n = β1 β2 β3 ... βn.

So for each complex, K_n = product of β's up to n.

So for [CoSCN]^+, K1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, K2=9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, K3=9*40*63=22680.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2-, K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Now, the general approach is that each complex is in equilibrium with the next.

But perhaps the way I represented the concentrations is correct, but perhaps I should model the distribution using K's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the fraction of each species using the cumulative K's and the concentrations.

Wait, another method is to use the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants and the available SCN^- concentration.

The distribution can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Where f_n is the fraction of the nth complex.

Wait, but wait, in our case, the complexes are [Co]^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So the formula would be:

f_0 = [Co^2+] / ( [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-1] + [Co(SCN)_4^-2] )

But [Co^2+] can be expressed in terms of K1 and K2, etc.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the fractions can be found by considering the ratio of each species to the total.

But perhaps using the stability constants and the [SCN^-], the fraction of each species can be determined using the formula:

f_n = ( K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{i=0}^{4} K_i [SCN]^i )

Where K_0 is 1 (the concentration of Co^2+).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Yes, because the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, and the fraction of each species can be expressed in terms of the cumulative formation constants and the [SCN^-].

So, in this model:

f_n = ( K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{n=0}^4 K_n [SCN]^n )

Where K_0=1, K_1=β1=9, K_2=β1β2=360, K3=β1β2β3=22680, K4=β1β2β3β4=362880.

Wait, but wait, K_0 is the concentration of the free ion (Co^2+), so K_0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

So, let me compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each K_n [SCN]^n:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

n=1:9 * (0.1)^1 =0.9.

n=2: 360 * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880 * (0.1)^4 =362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum these up: 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.

The denominator is 64.468.

The f_2 is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is (3.6) /64.468.

So f_2 =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05573, or 5.573%.

But that's about 5.57%, which is not matching any of the options. The options are all higher.

Wait, that can't be right because according to this, the correct answer would be around 5.5%, but the options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the model is correct, but I'm missing something. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the [SCN^-] is not 0.1 M, but when the complexes form, the free [SCN^-] is lower. So perhaps I shouldn't treat [SCN^-] as constant. Oh, right, that's a point I completely missed.

Ah! That's probably where I went wrong. Because when the complexes form, they consume SCN^- ions, so [SCN^-] can't be taken as 0.1 M in the calculations.

So, this complicates things. Now, I need to model the system with the correct [SCN^-], which is a variable because it changes based on the amount of complexes formed.

But that's more complicated because now we have two variables: [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]. However, the problem gives the total Co concentration as 0.01 M, and the total SCN^- is 0.1 M, but some is consumed by the complexes.

Wait, the initial concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M. The total SCN^- in solution includes the free SCN^- and the one bound in complexes.

So, the total SCN^- = [SCN^-]_free + n * [Co(SCN)_n], where n is the number of SCN- in each complex.

Wait, but that sounds too complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the amount of SCN^- consumed is negligible compared to the initial 0.1 M, so that [SCN^-] can be approximated as 0.1 M. But perhaps that's not the case here because the K values are so large, leading to a lot of complex formation.

Wait, let's consider the total SCN^- concentration:

Total SCN^- = [SCN^-]_free + [CoSCN^+]_total + 2*[Co(SCN)_2^0]_total + 3*[Co(SCN)_3^-]_total +4*[Co(SCN)_4^2-]_total.

Because each complex uses n SCN^- per molecule.

But solving this would require multiple steps, which might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an assumption that [SCN^-]_free is much less than the initial 0.1 M, but given the high K values, perhaps it's better to model without that assumption.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure about the exact method. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The fraction of each complex can be determined using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]_free^n ) / ( sum_{n=0}^4 K_n [SCN]_free^n )

But the problem is that [SCN]_free is not known and depends on the amount of complexes formed.

Wait, but the total SCN^- is 0.1 M, and the total Co is 0.01 M.

The moles of SCN^- used in complexes is sum_{n=1}^4 n [Co(SCN)_n].

But this seems very involved. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Another idea: use the conditional formation constants. The conditional formation constant K' is the formation constant adjusted for the free ion concentration. But perhaps that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering all possible complexes and their formation, but I'm not sure. Let me try to find another way.

Wait, I think the mistake I made earlier was to assume [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but in reality, it's lower because some SCN^- is tied up in the complexes.

But given the high stability constants, the [SCN^-] could be much lower than 0.1 M. So the initial approach, which assumed [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, might have given an incorrect result.

So the correct approach would involve solving for [SCN^-] along with [Co^2+], but this requires setting up equations that account for both.

Let me try to set up the equations.

Let’s denote:

[Co^2+] = x

[SCN^-]_free = y

Total Co in solution: x + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 0.01 M.

Each complex can be expressed in terms of x and y:

[CoSCN^+] = K1 x y =9 x y.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = K2 x y^2 = 360 x y^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = K3 x y^3 =22680 x y^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = K4 x y^4 =362880 x y^4.

So, the total Co equation is:

x + 9 x y + 360 x y^2 + 22680 x y^3 + 362880 x y^4 = 0.01.

Factor out x:

x [1 + 9 y + 360 y^2 + 22680 y^3 + 362880 y^4 ] = 0.01.

Equation 1: x = 0.01 / (1 +9 y +360 y^2 +22680 y^3 +362880 y^4 )

Now, the total SCN^- is:

0.1 = y + [CoSCN^+] + 2 [Co(SCN)_2^0] +3 [Co(SCN)_3^-] +4 [Co(SCN)_4^2-].

Substituting the expressions in terms of x and y:

0.1 = y + (9 x y) + 2*(360 x y^2) +3*(22680 x y^3) +4*(362880 x y^4 ).

Factor x:

0.1 = y + x y [9 + 2*360 y +3*22680 y^2 +4*362880 y^3 ].

But x is given by equation 1 as 0.01 / (denominator), so substituting x into this equation would give an equation in y.

But this seems very complicated, and I'm not sure how to solve it analytically. Perhaps it's easier to make an assumption that y is much smaller than 0.1, but considering the high K values, maybe y is much smaller.

Wait, but given the high stability constants, perhaps almost all Co is in the highest possible complex, which would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that y is approximately 0.1 M is acceptable, but that would give the earlier result of about 5.5%, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the correct value is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me go back to the initial approach, where I assumed [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and then recompute the percentage.

In that approach, [Co(SCN)_2^0] was 5.5836e-5 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is (5.5836e-5)/0.01 =0.0055836 → ~0.56%.

But the options are much higher, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the stability constants as cumulative instead of stepwise.

Wait, perhaps the given β values are cumulative, not stepwise.

Wait, if β1 is the cumulative constant for [CoSCN]^+, then β1=9.

β2 would be the cumulative constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be 40.

Then β3 is 63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and β4=16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, that can't be correct because β4=16 is much lower than β3=63. Stability constants typically increase with the number of ligands added, but here β4 is lower than β3, which doesn't make sense. So probably, the given β values are stepwise.

Another idea: perhaps the problem considers the formation constants as cumulative, not stepwise. Let me see.

If β1 is the cumulative constant for [CoSCN]^+, then:

β1=9 → [CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-].

If β2 is the cumulative for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2.

But wait, that would mean that β1=9 is the K1, and β2=40 is K2=β1*β2_step, so β2_step=40/9 ≈4.444.

But this doesn't fit with the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are cumulative.

Wait, let me try this approach.

If the given β values are cumulative formation constants:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]) =9.

β2= [Co(SCN)_2^0]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]^2 )=40.

β3= [Co(SCN)_3^-]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]^3 )=63.

β4= [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]^4 )=16.

Wait, but then β4 is less than β3, which is unusual. Typically, higher-order complexes have higher formation constants. Unless the 4th complex is less stable, which is possible, but perhaps this is an error in the question. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with this assumption.

But wait, with the given β values, I'll proceed.

So, in this case, each complex's concentration is given by β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So,

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x y =9 x y.

[Co(SCN)_2^0]= β2 x y^2 =40 x y^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]= β3 x y^3=63 x y^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 x y^4=16 x y^4.

Now, the total cobalt is:

x +9 x y +40 x y^2 +63 x y^3 +16 x y^4=0.01.

And the total SCN^- is:

0.1 = y + [CoSCN^+] + 2 [Co(SCN)_2^0] +3 [Co(SCN)_3^-] +4 [Co(SCN)_4^2-].

= y +9 x y + 2*(40 x y^2 ) +3*(63 x y^3 ) +4*(16 x y^4 ).

= y +9 x y +80 x y^2 + 189 x y^3 +64 x y^4.

So, now we have two equations:

Equation 1: x (1+9 y +40 y^2 +63 y^3 +16 y^4 ) =0.01.

Equation 2: y +9 x y +80 x y^2 +189 x y^3 +64 x y^4 =0.1.

But solving these two equations simultaneously is quite complex.

But perhaps, given that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, y is approximately 0.1, but let's check.

Let me make the assumption that y ≈0.1, and see if that holds.

If y=0.1:

Equation 1: x (1+9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 )

Compute each term:

1 =1.

9*0.1=0.9.

40*(0.01)=0.4.

63*(0.001)=0.063.

16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004226 M.

Now, equation 2:

y=0.1 → check if equation holds.

Compute equation 2 with x=0.004226, y=0.1.

Equation 2:0.1 +9*0.004226*0.1 +80*0.004226*(0.1)^2 +189*0.004226*(0.1)^3 +64*0.004226*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

Term1:0.1.

Term2:9*0.004226*0.1=9*0.0004226=0.0038034.

Term3:80 *0.004226 *0.01=80 *0.00004226=0.0033808.

Term4:189 *0.004226 *0.001=189 *0.000004226≈0.0008024.

Term5:64 *0.004226 *0.0001=64 *0.0000004226≈0.00002707.

Sum all terms:

0.1 +0.0038034=0.1038034.

+0.0033808 →0.1071842.

+0.0008024 →0.1079866.

+0.00002707 →0.10801367.

But the right-hand side of equation 2 is 0.1, so 0.108 ≈0.1. Hmm, not quite matching. So the assumption that y=0.1 may not be accurate.

But perhaps, with x calculated as 0.004226, the actual y would be a bit lower than 0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an iterative approach to find y.

But this is getting complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the given stability constants are stepwise, and I should proceed with the initial approach but reconsider how the fractions are calculated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the percentage we're looking for is the fraction of the third species, which is [Co(SCN)_2^0], and that fraction is (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4).

Wait, but in the initial approach, I used [SCN] as 0.1 M, which leads to the denominator being 64.468, and the numerator for [Co(SCN)_2^0] being 3.6, giving f=5.57%, which doesn't match any options.

But the options are in the 16-42% range, so perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the β's.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β values are for the cumulative formation constants. Let me try this approach again.

If the β's are cumulative:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]) =9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]^2 )=40.

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]^3 )=63.

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/(Co^2+ [SCN^-]^4 )=16.

Then, the fractions are:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{i=0}^4 β_i [SCN]^i )

Wait, but β_0 is 1, as it's the free Co^2+.

So,

sum =1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 →1.

9*0.1=0.9.

40*0.01=0.4.

63*0.001=0.063.

16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum =1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016≈2.3646.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2^0] is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%.

Which matches option D.

Ah, so the correct approach is to treat the β values as cumulative formation constants.

Thus, the correct percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the system using the provided stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants are interpreted as cumulative formation constants, where each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the corresponding complex:

- β₁ = 9 for [CoSCN]^+  
- β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0  
- β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-  
- β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}  

The total cobalt concentration is given as 0.01 M, and the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{i=0}^4 \beta_i [\text{SCN}]^i}
\]

Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (representing the free Co²⁺ ion), and \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The denominator is the sum of all equilibrium terms:

\[
\text{Sum} = \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4
\]

Compute each term:

- \( 1 \)  
- \( 9(0.1) = 0.9 \)  
- \( 40(0.1)^2 = 40(0.01) = 0.4 \)  
- \( 63(0.1)^3 = 63(0.001) = 0.063 \)  
- \( 16(0.1)^4 = 16(0.0001) = 0.0016 \)  

Adding these:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{40(0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
