Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, that's 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), so p = 1/d or something like that. Oh right, the formula is p = 1/(d in parsecs). So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So I can write that as N ∝ 1/p^5. But since p = 1/d, substituting that in, 1/p is d. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, because N is proportional to (1/p)^5, which is d^5. Hmm, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So N ∝ d^5, which would be a big increase as distance increases. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because if you look further away, I would think you see fewer stars, not more. Or does it depend on how the density changes?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is about the number density of stars in a region. So the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. Or perhaps the number of stars in a shell at distance r.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, like the number density as a function of distance.

So let's model this. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/p^5. But p is 1/d (parallax in parsecs), so 1/p is d. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that would mean that as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5, which seems odd. But maybe the number of stars in a given region is related to the volume, and that's why it's increasing with distance.

Wait, no, but wait, the number of stars in a region at a certain distance. Let me think about flux. The flux from stars decreases with distance squared, but how the number of stars you observe varies depends on how the density changes with distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the region is such that the number of stars in each shell is being considered. So each shell at a distance d has a certain thickness. The question is about the number per unit distance.

Wait, let me approach it mathematically. Let's say N is proportional to 1/p^5. Since p = 1/d (parallax in parsecs), then 1/p = d. So 1/p^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with d^5 as distance increases. But wait, that doesn't make sense in terms of seeing stars. Because when you look further away, the stars are dimmer and fewer in a given area, right? Unless the density of stars increases with distance, which is not usual.

Wait a second, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit area per unit distance. Because when you observe stars, the number you see depends on both the area you're looking at and the distance. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number per unit volume.

Wait, stars in a volume: the number of stars in a volume element dV would depend on the density. But the question is about N as a function of parallax, which relates to distance.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of stars per unit area (since it's a region of the sky) depends on the distance. So if you have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd² dr, multiplied by the number density of stars (stars per unit volume). But in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/p^5, so N ∝ d^5.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me express the number of stars as a function of parallax:

N = k * (1/p^5), where k is a constant.

But since p = 1/d, then 1/p = d. So N = k * d^5.

So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars is increasing with the fifth power of distance. But that seems strange because when you look further away, the density of stars in a given area should decrease, but perhaps in this problem, the density is increasing with distance.

Wait, but how does that tie into the number of stars per unit distance? Because the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps we're looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

So N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the number of stars in a unit distance range increases with r^4. So the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider how the number varies with distance. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/p^5. So N = constant * (1/p^5). Since p = 1/r (if r is in parsecs), then N = constant * r^5.

If we want to find how N changes with r, it's directly proportional to r^5. But the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So per unit increase in r, how does N change? So that's the derivative dN/dr, which would be 5r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think if I interpreted the question correctly. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So it's N ∝ 1/p^5. So N ∝ p^-5.

But p is inversely proportional to r, so p = 1/r. So p^-5 = r^5, so N ∝ r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5.

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range). So per unit r, the change in N is dN/dr.

So dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

So the number of stars in a region per unit distance (i.e., the change in N per unit r) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is option C, which is ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( p \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( p = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, the number of stars becomes \( N \propto r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This requires finding the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to option C, which states \( \sim r^4 \).
