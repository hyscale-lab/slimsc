Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots and how it affects the observed brightness, similar to a planet transiting the star. The task is to find the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Wait, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar is about the same as R☉, which is about 7e5 km or 696,340 km. But I might not need the exact number yet.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Wait, does that mean the spots are cooler? Because if the star is 6000 K and the spots are 1000K less, then they're 5000 K? Or is it a difference of 1000K? The wording says a temperature difference of 1000K. So spots are 5000 K, perhaps, since 6000-1000=5000.

Filling factor is 20% for the spots. Filling factor, right, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So one hemisphere is half the star's surface. So total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) )? Because the star's surface area is 4π R², so one hemisphere is 2π R². Filling factor 20% means 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R² area is spots.

But wait, the brightness variation is because of the spots. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness dip depends on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

The problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations show periodic brightness variations. These variations are similar to what would be caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. So, the question is asking, what's the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Wait, but if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would cause the same dip? So, the dip caused by the spots is being compared to the dip caused by a planet.

So, the brightness variation from the spots and from the planet should be the same amplitude. So I need to calculate the relative brightness change due to the spots and set that equal to the relative change from the planet.

How do you calculate the brightness change due to spots? Well, the star's total luminosity is the sum of the spotted areas and the normal areas. When the star rotates, the spots come into view or go away, so the observed brightness changes.

Wait, but when a planet transits the star, the planet blocks some light. The dip is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar², so the fraction is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2).

But for the spots, the calculation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the day side, they contribute less to the total brightness. But wait, I think the problem is considering the change in brightness when spots rotate into view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower than when it's not.

Wait, perhaps the apparent brightness variation is due to the spots being on the side we see. So the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted one is. But wait, the star is emitting light from its entire surface, so the spots being on the hemisphere would modulate the brightness as the star rotates.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation arises because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, a part of the star's surface (covered by spots) contributes less light. Hence, the total light is lower.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is due to the fact that some regions are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the overall brightness decreases.

So, the total brightness as observed is the sum of the flux from all the surface areas visible. When the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere with spots is only visible when the star's rotation brings it into view. Wait, no. Actually, the star is a sphere, and when it rotates, different parts come into view. Hmm, but if the spots are on only one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, a portion of the star's surface (the spotted part) is visible, which is cooler. So the observed brightness would dip when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star emits light from all over its surface, so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spots contribute less flux, causing the total brightness to drop.

So the variation in brightness (delta L) is the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star's total surface is 4π R². One hemisphere is spotted, which is 2π R². The other is unspotted, 2π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the unspotted area on the other side. Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when we see one hemisphere, the other is on the far side and not visible. So if the spotted hemisphere is the one we see, then the flux from that hemisphere is lower because of the spots. The far side (unspotted) contributes normally.

Wait, no. No, when the star rotates, one hemisphere is facing us. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots on that side. The other hemisphere is on the far side, so its spots (if any) are not visible. But in this case, only one hemisphere is spotty. So the other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no, because the far side is not visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, we see the spots, and the far side is the unspotted hemisphere. But that doesn't affect the observed flux, because the far side's flux isn't visible. So, the total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the flux from the spotted area (which is cooler) plus the flux from the unspotted far hemisphere.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. The hemisphere we're looking at is spotted, and the other is unspotted. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is (flux from spotted area) + (flux from unspotted far area). When the star rotates 180 degrees, the unspotted hemisphere faces us, so the flux is (flux from unspotted near side) + (flux from spotted far side, which we can't see). So the maximum flux is when we see the unspotted hemisphere, and the minimum when we see the spotted one.

Wait, but no, because whether the hemisphere is near or far, the flux contribution is from the surface area. So when the spotted hemisphere is near, its flux (which is lower) contributes, and the far side's flux is normal.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is (flux from spotted hemisphere) + (flux from unspotted far hemisphere). The flux from the spotted hemisphere is (filling factor)*(area of hemisphere)*sigma*Teff^4 * (1 - filling factor) * T_spots^4? Wait, no. Let me think.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is in view and when the unspotted is in view, then find the difference. 

The star's total flux without spots is L = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

When one hemisphere is spotted, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

Flux_spotted = (spotted area) * sigma T_spot^4 + (unspotted area) * sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no. The spotted area is filling factor * hemisphere area. The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted. Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire hemisphere is either covered (20%) with spots or is normal. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So the spotted hemisphere's area is 20% spots and 80% normal.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux from that hemisphere is (0.2 * area_hemi * sigma T_spot^4) + (0.8 * area_hemi * sigma Teff^4). And the flux from the other hemisphere (unspotted) is area_hemi * sigma Teff^4.

So total flux when spotted hemisphere is visible:

F_spotted = [0.2 * (2π R²) * sigma T_spot^4 ] + [0.8 * (2π R²) * sigma T_eff^4 ] + [ (2π R²) * sigma T_eff^4 ]

Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is not spotty. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere's flux is at Teff.

So F_spotted = (0.2 * area_hemi * sigma T_spot^4) + (0.8 * area_hemi * sigma T_eff^4) ) + (area_other_hemi * sigma T_eff^4)

Area_other_hemi is the same as area_hemi, since each hemisphere is 2π R².

So, F_spotted = [0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4 + (0.8 * 2π R² + 2π R²) * sigma T_eff^4 ] 

Wait, no, the 0.8 * 2π R² is the unspotted part of the near hemisphere. The other hemisphere is all unspotted, so 2π R² * Teff^4.

So F_spotted = [0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4] + [ (0.8 * 2π R² + 2π R²) * sigma T_eff^4 ]

Simplify that:

= [0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4] + [ (2.8 * 2π R²) * sigma T_eff^4 ]

Wait, 0.8*2πR² (unspotted in near hemisphere) + 2π R² (far hemisphere, which is all unspotted) = (0.8 + 1) * 2π R² = 1.8 * 2π R² = 3.6 π R²? Wait, wait no.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is near, the near hemisphere has 20% spots and 80% normal. The far hemisphere is entirely normal. So the near hemisphere contributes 0.2 * 2π R² * T_spot^4 * sigma + 0.8 * 2π R² * T_eff^4 * sigma.

The far hemisphere contributes 2π R² * T_eff^4 * sigma.

So total F_spotted = [0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² * sigma T_eff^4 ] + [2π R² * sigma T_eff^4 ]

Combine terms:

= (0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4) + (0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 + 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 )

= (0.4π R² sigma T_spot^4) + ( (0.8 + 1) * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 )

Wait, 0.8 * 2π R² is 1.6 π R², and adding 2π R² gives 3.6 π R².

So F_spotted = 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 3.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4.

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (the spotted one is on the far side), the near hemisphere is unspotted, and the far is spotted.

So F_unspotted = (2π R² * sigma T_eff^4 ) + [0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 ]

Which would be:

= 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 + [0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 1.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4 ]

Combine terms:

= (2π R² + 1.6 π R²) sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4

= 3.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4.

Wait, that's the same as F_spotted. Hmm, that can't be right. Because when the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the near hemisphere is all unspotted, but the spots are on the far side, which we can't see. So the flux from the far side doesn't matter for the observed brightness. Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the near side is completely unspotted.

So let me re-calculate F_unspotted.

When the unspotted hemisphere is near, the near hemisphere's flux is 2π R² sigma T_eff^4. The far hemisphere is the spotted one, but since it's on the far side, we can't see its spots. So the far side's flux is 2π R² sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, no. Because the spotted hemisphere is on the far side. The flux from the far side is the same as the unspotted area, but the spots are on that side. Wait, no. The entire far side is the spotted hemisphere, but the near side is unspotted.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The star has two hemispheres: one is spotted (filling factor 20%), the other is unspotted.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us (near side), the flux from that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² * sigma T_eff^4. The far side is the unspotted hemisphere, which contributes 2π R² * sigma T_eff^4.

So F_spotted = (0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4 ) + (0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 ) + (2π R² sigma T_eff^4 )

= 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + (0.8 * 2π R² + 2π R² ) sigma T_eff^4

= 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + (3.6 π R² ) sigma T_eff^4.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (near side), the near side contributes 2π R² sigma T_eff^4. The far side is the spotted hemisphere, which we can't see. So the far side's flux is the same as any hemisphere: 2π R² sigma T_eff^4, regardless of the spots, because the spots are on the far side and we can't see them. Wait, no. The far side's flux is determined by its own surface: it's the spotted hemisphere, so the flux from the far side when it's spotted is 0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, that's correct. Because the far side is the spotted hemisphere. So when the unspotted hemisphere is near, the near flux is 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 (unspotted), and the far flux is (0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4).

So F_unspotted = 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 + (0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 )

= 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 1.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4

= (2π R² + 1.6 π R²) sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4

= 3.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4.

Wait, that's the same as F_spotted. So the flux doesn't change? That can't be right. How can that be? Because when the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the spots' flux is not contributing to the observed brightness. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me re-express F_spotted and F_unspotted.

F_spotted:
- Near hemisphere (spotted): 0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² * sigma T_eff^4
- Far hemisphere (unspotted): 2π R² * sigma T_eff^4.
So F_spotted = [0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 ] + [ (0.8 * 2π R²) + 2π R² ) * sigma T_eff^4 ]
= 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + ( (1.6 + 2 ) π R² ) sigma T_eff^4
Wait, 0.8 * 2π R² is 1.6 π R². Adding 2π R² (far side) gives 3.6 π R².

F_spotted = 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 3.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4.

F_unspotted:
- Near hemisphere (unspotted): 2π R² sigma T_eff^4
- Far hemisphere (spotted): 0.2 * 2π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² sigma T_eff^4
So F_unspotted = 2π R² sigma T_eff^4 + [0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 1.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4 ]
= (2π R² + 1.6 π R²) sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4

Which is 3.6 π R² sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4.

So F_spotted = F_unspotted? That can't be right. So there's no variation in brightness? That doesn't make sense. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, maybe it's because the star's rotation doesn't change the total flux; whether the spots are on the near or far side, the total flux is the same because it's the same amount of spotted and unspotted areas. But that doesn't make sense because when the spots are on the near side, part of the area we see is cooler, so the observed flux should dip.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered in spots, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the observed brightness is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So the variation arises because when the spotted hemisphere is near, the spots contribute less flux than the unspotted areas.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the far side is the unspotted hemisphere. No, the far side is just the other side. Wait, perhaps the calculation is different.

Alternative approach: The star emits light from its entire surface. The observed flux is the sum of all surface elements visible. But when the star is viewed from Earth, only one hemisphere is visible at any time. So when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere changes.

Wait, no. No, actually, for a star, you can see all the surface except the far side. Wait, no, no. For a rotating star, you can see more of the surface as it spins. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star as a blackbody disk, and the spots are on one side, so when the star rotates, the apparent brightness changes because a cooler (or hotter) region comes into view.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the star as a uniform blackbody disk, with spots that are cooler. The brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, but for the purpose of brightness variation due to rotation, it's often treated as a disk. So when the star rotates, the spots on the surface move in and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip.

But perhaps the exact method is to calculate the change in apparent brightness when a portion of the star is covered by spots.

Wait, but in this problem, the entire hemisphere is either covered by spots or not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed brightness variation is due to the fact that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, that hemisphere contributes less flux than when it's not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified. The star's total brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is (1 - filling factor) * Teff^4 + filling factor * T_spot^4, all multiplied by the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeled as the star having an average temperature, and the spots contribute a lower temperature. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spots.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the relative flux variation caused by the spots.

The key is that the brightness variation due to the spots is similar to the variation caused by a planet transiting the star. So, the dip in brightness when the planet transits is (Rp / Rstar)^2. But for the spots, the dip is due to the cooler spots reducing the total flux.

Wait, no. Because when a planet transits, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because that's the area blocked. But when the star has spots, the dip is due to the spots being cooler and thus contributing less flux when they're in view.

So the dip in brightness from the spots would be (delta F) / F, where delta F is the difference between when the spots are in view and when they're not.

So, to find the amplitude of the brightness variation (delta F / F) caused by the spots, and set that equal to the amplitude caused by the planet, which is (Rp / Rstar)^2, then find Rp.

Wait, let me proceed.

First, calculate the relative change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is in view compared to when it's not.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² sigma Teff^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = F0 * [ (1 - (filling factor) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) / 2 ] + something else? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the total flux can be expressed as F = F0 * [ 1 - (filling factor) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ) ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio.

The spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots. Each spot has T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So, the flux from the spotted hemisphere when it's visible is:

F_spotted_hemi = (0.2 * (2π R²) * sigma T_spot^4) + (0.8 * (2π R²) * sigma Teff^4 )

The flux from the unspotted hemisphere (when the spotted one is on the far side) is:

F_unspotted_hemi = 2π R² sigma Teff^4

But when the star is observed, only one hemisphere is visible. So, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is F_spotted_hemi. When the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted_hemi.

Wait, no, because the star's entire surface emits, but when you view a hemisphere, you see all the surface except the far side. Wait, maybe not. For a distant observer, the entire star's surface is visible, just that the rotation makes different parts come into view. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies the situation by treating the entire star's surface as being split into two halves: one spotted, one not. So when the spotted half is facing us, the total flux is F_spotted = (0.2 * (π R²) * sigma T_spot^4) + (0.8 * (π R²) * sigma Teff^4 ) + (π R² sigma Teff^4), because the other hemisphere is unspotted.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternative approach: Assume that when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the total flux is the sum of the spotted area (20% of hemisphere) at T_spot and the rest at Teff. When the opposite hemisphere is in view, the flux is all from the unspotted hemisphere.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think in terms of relative flux.

The flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F1 = (filling factor) * (area of hemisphere) * sigma * T_spot^4 + (1 - filling factor) * (area of hemisphere) * sigma * Teff^4 + area of the other hemisphere * sigma * Teff^4.

Similarly, when the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F2 = area of visible hemisphere (unspotted) * sigma * Teff^4 + area of the other hemisphere (spotted) * sigma * T_spot^4 * filling factor + (1 - filling factor) * sigma * Teff^4 * area.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the average flux. Let me think.

The total surface area of the star is 4π R². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The unspotted area is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

The total flux from the star is F_total = (0.4 π R²) sigma T_spot^4 + (3.6 π R²) sigma Teff^4.

When the star is viewed, the observed flux depends on which part is visible. But no, the entire surface emits, so the observer sees all the surface. Wait, but that can't be right because when a star rotates, you see different parts, but the total emitted flux doesn't change. So the brightness variation must be due to the changing area of spots that are on the near side (facing the observer) versus the far side.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is considering that when the star has a spot on one hemisphere, the brightness variation is because the spot alternates between being on the near and far side as the star rotates. So the observed flux is F = F_unspotted + F_spotted_visible.

Wait, no. Let me think of it as the star having two regions: one with spots (A) and one without (B). When star rotates, region A comes into view, then B, then A, etc. The flux when A is in view is F_A = area_A * sigma T_spot^4 + area_B * sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no, area B is the other hemisphere, which is unspotted. So when A is in view, the flux is (0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4) + (2π R² * sigma Teff^4). Because the other hemisphere is unspotted and contributes normally.

When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is in view, the flux is (2π R² * sigma Teff^4) + (0.2 * 2π R² * sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * 2π R² * sigma Teff^4). Wait, because half of the star's surface is unspotted, and the other half is the spotted hemisphere.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified by considering that the spots are on a single hemisphere, and as the star rotates, the observed flux varies because the spots come into view or not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to an inhomogeneous surface where a portion of the star is cooler. The brightness variation, or the amplitude, would be the difference between when the cooler region is facing us and when it's not.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the brightness dips are similar in amplitude to a planet transit.

So, perhaps the approach is to compute the fractional change in flux due to the spots when they are in view, and set that equal to the fractional change from a planet, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So, the fractional change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Let me compute F_unspotted and F_spotted.

F_unspotted is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is:

F_unspotted = (2π R²) * sigma Teff^4 (unspotted near) + (2π R²) * sigma Teff^4 (spotted far) 

Wait, no, the far side's contribution is still all unspotted? No, the far side is the spotted hemisphere.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the star having two hemispheres: one with spots (A) and one without (B). When hemisphere A is visible, the flux from A is (filling factor) * area_A * sigma T_spot^4 + (1 - filling factor) * area_A * sigma Teff^4. The flux from hemisphere B is area_B * sigma Teff^4.

But area_A is 2π R², same as area_B.

Wait, but when hemisphere A is visible, you can't see hemisphere B. Or can you? No, because you can see the entire star's surface from any angle, but as it rotates, different parts come into view. Wait, no. For a distant observer, regardless of rotation, the entire surface of the star emits light toward the observer. So the total flux doesn't change, unless parts of the surface are blocked (like by a planet).

Wait, that can't be right because the problem says that the brightness varies as the star rotates. So perhaps the star is only partially covered by spots, and as it rotates, the spots come into and out of our view, causing the flux to dip when they are on the near side.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on a single hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is lower because part of the star's surface is cooler. But the entire surface emits, so the total flux is the same, but the brightness changes because the spots are on the hemisphere that is facing us.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux, so the total observed flux is lower.

Wait, but the star's total flux is the sum of all surface elements. So, if the spots are on the near hemisphere, but the far side has no spots, then the flux is the same as when the spots are on the far side. So the brightness shouldn't change. That doesn't make sense because the problem states that brightness variations are observed.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the spots are on the surface such that when the star rotates, the spots come into view and make part of the star appear cooler, leading to a dip in the observed brightness.

Wait, perhaps the scenario is that the star's surface is divided into two equal parts: one with spots (20% coverage), and the other without. As the star rotates, these two parts come into view, leading to a periodic change in brightness.

So when the spotted part is facing us, the flux is lower, and when the unspotted part is facing, the flux is higher.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². The spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The total flux when the spotted area is facing us is F_spotted = 0.4π R² sigma T_spot^4 + (4π R² - 0.4π R²) sigma Teff^4.

When the unspotted area is facing us, it's F_unspotted = (4π R²) sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no, because the unspotted area is the entire star except the 0.4π R². So when the spotted area is on the near side, F_spotted = 0.4π R² sigma T_spot^4 + (4π R² - 0.4π R²) sigma Teff^4.

When the spotted area is on the far side, the near side is unspotted, so F_unspotted = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because when the spotted area is on the near side, the far side isn't contributing any more than when it's on the far side. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies the situation by treating the entire star as having a certain fraction of its surface covered by spots, regardless of rotation. So the total flux is F = F0 * (1 - filling factor) + filling factor * F_spot.

Wait, but the flux would then be the same regardless of rotation. So the brightness wouldn't vary, which contradicts the problem statement.

Ah, maybe the problem is that the star is only emitting from the hemisphere that is facing us as it rotates. No, that's not correct, because a star's light comes from the entire surface.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should find another approach. Let me think about the planet case.

The planet transits the star, causing a dip in brightness of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the relative change is (Rp²)/(Rstar²).

For the star with spots, the relative change is the difference in flux between when the spots are visible and when they're not. Let's compute that.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

When a fraction f of the star's surface is covered by spots with temperature T_spot, the total flux is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * sigma T_spot^4 * (R²) * (area fraction).

Wait, no. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

So F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * (sigma T_spot^4) * (R²).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because F0 is 4π R² sigma Teff^4. The area covered by spots is f * 4π R². So the flux from the spots is f * 4π R² sigma T_spot^4.

So F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * (4π R² sigma T_spot^4).

Wait, but in this case, the spots are on one hemisphere, not the entire surface. So f is not the fraction of the entire surface, but the fraction of the hemisphere.

So f_hemi = 0.2 (filling factor). The area of the hemisphere is 2π R², so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is in view is F_spotted = (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4.

The total flux when the other hemisphere is in view is F_unspotted = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

Wait, but that would mean that F_spotted < F_unspotted, so the brightness dips when the spotted hemisphere is in view.

So the variation in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotted = [4π R² sigma Teff^4] - [ (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 ]

= [4π R² sigma Teff^4] - [ 3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 ]

= (4π R² sigma Teff^4 - 3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 ) - 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4

= 0.4 π R² sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4

= 0.4 π R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The relative change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted = [0.4 π R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 π R² sigma Teff^4 ]

Simplify: (0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 Teff^4 )

= 0.1 (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

Given Teff =6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (T_spot / Teff) = 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(T_spot / Teff)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ let's calculate:

0.8333^2 = approx 0.6944, then squared is approx 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So relative change is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, or about 5.177% dip.

Now, the planet transit causes a dip of (Rp / Rstar)^2.

We set this equal to the relative change from the spots.

So (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but none of the options are around 0.2276. Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the relative change. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says that the star has only one hemisphere covered with spots. So when that hemisphere is in view, the flux is lower.

But wait, perhaps the approach should consider that only the visible hemisphere's spots affect the flux. So when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is (spotted area) * T_spot^4 + (unspotted area of that hemisphere) * Teff^4.

But wait, the unspotted area is the rest of the hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotted = (0.2 * 2π R²) * sigma T_spot^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * sigma Teff^4.

The other hemisphere is not visible, so its flux doesn't contribute.

Wait, no, because the observer can see the entire star. So when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the far side (unspotted) is also visible. Wait, no, because the far side is on the opposite side of the star. So the observer can't see the far side when the near side is the spotted hemisphere.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The observer can see the entire surface, but when the star rotates, different parts come into view.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think differently.

Let me try to model the brightness variation as the star rotates. The star's brightness varies as the spotted hemisphere comes into view. When the spotted hemisphere is entirely visible, the brightness is lower. The change in flux is the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is in view and when it's not.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotted = 0.2 * (2π R²) * sigma T_spot^4 + 0.8 * (2π R²) * sigma Teff^4.

When the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_unspotted = 2π R² * sigma Teff^4.

The variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted.

Compute this:

F_unspotted = 2π R² sigma Teff^4.

F_spotted = [0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 ] + [1.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 ]

So F_unspotted - F_spotted = (2π R² sigma Teff^4 ) - (0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4 + 1.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 )

= [2π R² sigma Teff^4 - 1.6 π R² sigma Teff^4 ] - 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4.

= 0.4 π R² sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² sigma T_spot^4.

= 0.4 π R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The relative change is [0.4 π R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (2π R² sigma Teff^4 )

Simplify:

= (0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 Teff^4 )

= 0.2 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) 

Now, Teff is 6000 K, T_spot is 5000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Relative change: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the relative dip is about 10.355%.

Set this equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which matches this.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the relative flux changes caused by the spots and compare it to the flux change caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Filling factor of spots**: \( f = 20\% = 0.2 \)
- **Star's radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (assumed to be equal to the Sun's radius).

### Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
The star's total flux without spots is:
\[
F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]
When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux in this case is:
\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = (1 - f) \cdot F_0 + f \cdot \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \cdot F_0
\]
The relative change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{rel}} = 1 - \left( (1 - f) + f \cdot \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{rel}} = 1 - \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
\]
\[
\left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]
\[
\Delta F_{\text{rel}} = 1 - (0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4823) = 1 - (0.8 + 0.0965) = 1 - 0.8965 = 0.1035
\]
Thus, the relative flux change due to the spots is approximately \( \Delta F_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.1035 \) (or 10.35%).

### Brightness Variation Due to a Planet:
The relative flux change caused by a planet transiting the star is:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
To match the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta F_{\text{rel}} = 0.1035
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
