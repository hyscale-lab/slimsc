Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it carefully. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine is a dienophile in some reactions, but wait, what's the structure of the starting material here?

Alright, cyclopent-1-enol means it's a five-membered ring with an enol group. The numbering starts at the double bond, so the enol is at position 1. The substituents are at position 4, two methyl groups. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with an enol (OH attached to the same carbon as the double bond) and two methyl groups on carbon 4.

Wait, enol can undergo various reactions. But when you have a conjugated diene, like the enol part, it can react with bromine in a dienophilic addition, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the enol is a conjugated diene? No, the enol is part of a cyclopentene ring, so maybe it's a diene. Wait, cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and an -OH on carbon 1. So the structure is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH on C1. And at C4, two methyl groups are attached.

So the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So when bromine (Br2) is added, what happens? I think bromine can add across the double bond. But wait, in what way? For alkenes, bromine adds via an electrophilic addition, typically in a dibromide. But wait, this is an enol, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, wait. Enols can undergo dienophilic reactions? Or maybe they undergo addition reactions. Alternatively, since the enol has a hydroxyl group, maybe the reaction forms a bromohydrin? No, because in bromohydrin formation, you have a different setup, maybe with a dihydroxy structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol group's double bond is where the bromine adds. So cyclopent-1-enol has a double bond between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would add across that double bond. Let me think about the mechanism. Bromine adds across double bonds in a dibromide addition, so the double bond opens up, with Br adding to each of the carbons. But wait, the enol has an OH group on one of the carbons involved in the double bond.

Wait, in the case of adding Br2 to an enol, perhaps the addition is not just across the double bond. Because the enol has a hydroxyl group that might participate in the reaction. Or maybe the hydroxyl group is part of the conjugated system, making the molecule more reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder, but that would require a diene and a dienophile. Wait, wait, wait. The starting material is a cyclopentene ring with an enol. So the enol part is a conjugated dienol? No, wait, it's a five-membered ring, so perhaps it's a diene. Let me think: cyclopent-1-enol is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C1. So that's a diene? No, wait, a diene has two double bonds or one double bond and conjugated double bonds. No, this is a single double bond, so it's not a diene. So, maybe the reaction is a simple dihydroxylation or addition.

Wait, another possibility: the enol has an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Wait, no, because the enol is a hydroxyl attached to a double bond. It's not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enol can undergo a conjugate addition with bromine. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the enol is more prone to electrophilic attack because of the conjugation with the hydroxyl group.

Wait, when you add bromine to an enol, what happens? Oh, wait, I think I've heard about the bromohydrin formation. But that typically occurs when a dienophile reacts with a diene, but maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Michael addition, but that's when you have a nucleophile adding to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Hmm, but here it's an enol, which is a hydroxyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the Br adds across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. Let me think about that.

The structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is a cyclopentene ring with OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. So the double bond is between C1 and C2.

When bromine adds, each Br would add to C1 and C2, right? So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, but wait, the C1 already has an OH group. Wait, that can't happen because in cyclopentene, the ring is connected in a way that C1 is adjacent to C2 and C5, and C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3, etc.

Wait, maybe the Br adds to the double bond, replacing the double bond with two single bonds, each having a Br. But C1 also has the OH group. So what would that look like?

Wait, if the double bond between C1 and C2 opens up, each adding a Br. But C1 already has an OH group. So would that produce 1,2-dibromocyclopentane with the OH on C1? But wait, that can't be right because the ring would have more than one substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure again. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the cyclopentene ring has the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4.

So, when bromine adds to the double bond, it would add across C1 and C2. So, each of those carbons would get a Br. But wait, C1 already has an OH. So the product would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Wait, but that would be a vicinal di bromide on the cyclopentanol ring.

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo... So these are possibilities.

But wait, another possibility is whether the reaction is something else. Could it be a dienol reaction? Or perhaps the enol has a conjugated system that reacts in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine adds in a way that forms a ketone. Wait, Enols can tautomerize to ketones. So perhaps the reaction forms a brominated ketone.

Wait, but in that case, the starting material is an enol, which can convert into a ketone. So if the enol is treated with bromine, perhaps it undergoes an addition across the double bond, forming a dibromide, but then tautomerizes to a ketone with bromine substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine adds to the carbonyl group, but wait, the starting material isn't a ketone; it's an enol. Unless the enol tautomerizes first.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position. So, the alpha carbon (adjacent to the carbonyl group, but wait, the molecule is an enol, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enol's double bond is more reactive. So when Br2 is added, it undergoes electrophilic addition, adding Br across the double bond.

But wait, the enol has an OH group on C1, so adding Br to C1 and C2 would lead to a vicinal dibromide, but with the OH still present.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Now, looking at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo.

So the stereochemistry depends on how the Br adds. Electrophilic addition of Br2 to a double bond typically proceeds via a cyclic bromonium intermediate, leading to anti addition. So the Brs would add on opposite sides.

Wait, but in a cyclic structure, like a cyclopentene, the addition would form a trans dibromide. So the Br atoms would be on the opposite faces, leading to a trans (or anti) configuration.

But wait, the original double bond in the enol is part of a ring. So the addition would cause the Brs to be on adjacent carbons but on the same face or opposite? Hmm, in a ring, the configuration can be a bit tricky. Let's imagine the cyclopentene ring: C1 is connected to C2 with a double bond. When Br2 adds, it would form a bromonium ion intermediate, and then the ring would open with the bromide ions adding to each carbon.

Wait, but in a cyclopentene, the ring is small, so the bromonium ion might be less strained, but the addition would still follow the same anti addition as in alkenes. So the two Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

So, after adding, the two Brs would be trans to each other on the cyclopentane ring.

But wait, the starting material has an OH on C1. So when Br adds to C1 and C2, the OH is on C1, which is now attached to Br. So the structure would have Br and OH on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the OH is on C1, so when Br adds to C1 and C2, C1 would have both OH and Br? No, wait, the enol is an alcohol attached to C1. So when Br adds to C1, it would be in addition to the OH. That can't be right because that would imply a geminal di-substitution, which is unlikely.

Wait, no, the enol has the structure where C1 is double bonded to C2 and has an -OH group. So the structure is:

C1 (OH) double bonded to C2, which is connected to C3, and C1 is connected to C5 and C4? Or wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally as a five-membered ring where C1 is adjacent to C2 and C5, and C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3.

So, in the enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1.

So when Br2 adds, each Br adds to C1 and C2. So C1 would have Br and OH, but that's not possible because that would mean two substituents on the same carbon besides the ring bonds. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the enol's double bond is between C1 and C2, but the OH is on C2 instead? No, because the name is 1-enol, so the OH is on C1.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the enol doesn't react with bromine in a simple addition, but instead, the ring reacts in a different way.

Another possibility: The enol is part of a conjugated system, making the ring more reactive. So when bromine is added, it adds in a conjugated fashion, perhaps leading to a bromoketone or another structure.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct myself. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So it's a cyclopentene ring where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group is on C1.

The reaction with bromine (Br2) would be an addition across the double bond. So each carbon (C1 and C2) would get a Br.

But wait, C1 already has an OH group. So would that mean that the product would have OH and Br on the same carbon? That doesn't make sense because that would imply a geminal di-substitution, which is not feasible in this case.

Wait, perhaps the OH group leaves, making a carbocation, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the addition of Br doesn't occur because the enol is too reactive elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, and then reacts with bromine. Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which would tautomerize to 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So if that's the case, then bromine would add to the carbonyl group.

Wait, bromine can undergo addition to carbonyl groups, but that typically requires specific conditions, like in the presence of a base or acid. For example, the addition of HBr to a ketone gives a bromide. But in this case, adding Br2 might not be the right condition.

Wait, another thought: the enol could react via conjugate addition. But Br2 is a dienophile in some cases, like in Diels-Alder reactions. So maybe the enol is acting as a diene. Wait, but the enol is only a single double bond, not a diene. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe the enol's conjugated system allows for a bromine to add in a way that forms a bromoketone or another structure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible products.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So both B and C are ketones with a single Br substitution.

Option A and D are diols with two Br atoms.

So the question is, does the reaction add Br across the double bond (leading to options A or D) or does it substitute in another position, perhaps leading to a ketone (options B or C)?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to the ketone form first. So 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol becomes 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, bromine adds to the carbonyl group. But wait, how?

Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic attack, but Br2 is more of an electrophilic reagent. Alternatively, in the presence of a base, perhaps a Michael addition occurs, but I don't think so here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is more reactive and undergoes some kind of bromination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the enol has an alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, but in the enol form, it's the same as the hydroxyl-bearing carbon). So, in the enol form, the alpha carbon is C1, which already has the OH group.

Wait, but when the enol is treated with bromine, perhaps the alpha position is brominated. But how? That would require some kind of electrophilic substitution, but I don't think that's common in this context.

Wait, maybe the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic attack, so the Br adds to the alpha position, which is C1.

But wait, the alpha position is already substituted with an OH. So maybe that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so let me try to think of the possible reaction pathways.

If the reaction is an addition across the double bond, the product would be a vicinal di bromide. That would correspond to options A or D. The stereoisomerism would depend on whether the addition is syn or anti.

But the presence of the OH group on C1 complicates this, because adding Br to C1 would lead to a structure where C1 has both OH and Br. That seems unlikely because two substituents on the same carbon in a small ring like cyclopentane might lead to steric strain.

Wait a minute, maybe the OH group is involved in the reaction. Perhaps the enol reacts in a way that the OH is converted into a better leaving group, allowing for some kind of substitution.

Wait, but under what conditions would that happen? Maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst, but the question doesn't specify any catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of bromine to the enol. Wait, but conjugate addition usually refers to adding across a conjugated diene, but this is a single double bond.

Wait, another thought: the enol could act as a dienophile if there's another double bond. But in this case, the molecule only has a single double bond, so it can't be a dienophile.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a cyclic bromonium ion, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the diradical mechanism. Wait, but that's more for reactions involving singlet oxygen or other such conditions, which I don't think apply here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple bromination of the ring. But the ring is already substituted with methyl groups and a hydroxyl group, so perhaps a substitution occurs. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is replaced by Br. That would require some kind of nucleophilic substitution, but in this case, the OH is on a cyclopentane ring, which is not particularly good for SN2 reactions due to steric hindrance. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group deprotonates, forming an enolate, which then reacts with bromine. But then, that would require a base, which isn't mentioned in the question.

Wait, but the question says "reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine". So perhaps it's just the dihydroxylation of the double bond, but with Br instead of OH groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the enol is more reactive than the ketone, so it undergoes bromine addition. But if the addition leads to a di bromide, then the product would have two Brs adjacent to each other, but that leaves the OH group on C1. So, maybe the OH is involved in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a bromonium ion, but the ring's small size makes it difficult, leading to ring opening with Br addition.

This is getting a bit too convoluted, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about each option.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the ketone is formed, and there's a Br on C2.

How would that happen? Maybe if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then Br adds to the alpha position (C2) via some mechanism. But I'm not sure about that.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the Br is on C4, which already has two methyl groups. That would make it 4-bromo-4,4-dimethyl, which is possible. But how would that bromine get there?

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are activating the ring towards electrophilic substitution, but I don't think cyclopentane rings undergo electrophilic substitution easily.

Wait, another thought: the enol might undergo oxidation. But bromine isn't typically an oxidizing agent in that context. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's double bond adds Br, but the OH group is somehow involved in the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 to the enol's double bond leads to the formation of a bromohydrin. A bromohydrin is when a bromine and a hydroxyl group are added across a double bond. But in this case, the enol already has an OH group on C1. So adding another OH and Br would not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the OH group is replaced by Br, but that's not a bromohydrin.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think back to the possible products.

If the double bond adds Br2, then the product is a vicinal di bromide. So the structure would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C1. But that would be a geminal di substitution, which is impossible because C1 can't have three substituents (the ring, Br, and OH). Therefore, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the enol rearranges before reacting. For example, the enol could tautomerize into the ketone form, which is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, bromine could add to the carbonyl group. Wait, but how? The carbonyl group can undergo nucleophilic attack, but Br2 is more of an electrophile.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo a conjugate addition. For example, bromine could add to the alpha position (C2) in a conjugate addition. That would form a bromide on C2, leading to option B.

But how? Typically, conjugate additions involve a nucleophile adding to the alpha position, but Br2 isn't a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes an acid-catalyzed addition, but again, the question doesn't specify any conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds to the carbonyl, but that would require some kind of enol formation again.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation, but that's with peracids, not bromine.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think of the possible options once more.

Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So that would imply that a Br is added to C2, which is adjacent to the ketone (originally the enol's C1).

Option C is 4-bromo... So Br on C4, which is already substituted with two methyl groups.

If the reaction adds Br to the ring, perhaps via some cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the enol's double bond reacts with Br2 in a way that forms a bromoalkene, but I don't see how that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's double bond is more reactive due to the adjacent hydroxyl group, making it more prone to bromine addition in a way that forms a bromoketone.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of an enol, bromine can add to form a bromohydrin. So the double bond adds Br and OH groups. But in this case, the enol already has an OH. So would that mean that both OH groups are added? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is a proton donor, leading to the formation of a bromide.

Wait, perhaps the enol's OH group is deprotonated, making it a better nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is involved in a cyclic bromonium ion, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options again and see which ones make the most sense.

Options A and D are di bromides on the cyclopentanol. Options B and C are mono bromides on the ketone.

So if the reaction adds Br across the double bond, it would produce a di bromide, which would be options A or D. But considering the substituents, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone and then bromine adds to the carbonyl, that would give a ketone with a Br substituent.

Wait, but ketones don't typically react with Br2 in a way that adds Br to the carbonyl group. Unless it's via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the enol's double bond reacts with Br2 to form a di bromide, but then the enol tautomerizes into a ketone, which would require moving the substituents. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the di bromide then undergoes some kind of elimination or rearrangement to form a ketone with a Br.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the most likely outcome based on the options. If the reaction adds Br to the double bond, the product would be a di bromide, but the options A and D suggest that. But considering the presence of the OH group, perhaps the di bromide would be less likely because of steric hindrance. Alternatively, the di bromide could form, but perhaps the stereochemistry is R and S, as in option A or D.

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R). So it depends on whether the addition is trans or not.

In bromine addition to alkenes, the Br atoms add in an anti fashion, leading to trans addition. So in a ring, that would mean they are on opposite faces.

But if the ring is small, like cyclopentane, this could lead to a specific diastereomer.

But I'm not sure which option is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the addition of Br across the double bond, leading to a di bromide.

Looking back, the options:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo...

So, if the addition is anti, the Brs would be on opposite faces. Since the ring is small, perhaps the configuration leads to either R,S or R,R.

Wait, in a cyclopentane ring, the addition of Br in anti would result in the Brs being on opposite sides. So, if the starting double bond is in a certain conformation, the Brs would add trans to each other.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky to determine the exact configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an addition but a substitution. But I don't see any good reason for that.

Given all this, I think the most plausible product is the addition of Br across the double bond, leading to a di bromide. So options A and D are the candidates. Between them, the stereochemistry depends on the addition's anti nature.

Wait, but considering the starting material, the enol could be in a certain configuration. If the OH is on C1, and the Br adds to C1 and C2 in an anti manner, the configuration would lead to either R,S or R,R.

But I'm not confident about the exact stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not an alcohol but a ketone, which would suggest options B or C.

Wait, another approach: what happens when an enol reacts with bromine? I seem to remember that enols can undergo bromination at the alpha position, but I'm not entirely sure.

If the enol adds Br to the alpha position, which in this case would be C2 (since the carbonyl is at C1 in the ketone form), then the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (option B).

But how would that happen? Maybe the enol's double bond allows for the bromine to add in a conjugate manner, leading to the bromide at the alpha position.

Alternatively, considering that the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then a bromide adds to the alpha position via a conjugate addition mechanism.

Wait, but that would require some kind of catalyst or specific conditions, which the question doesn't specify.

Alternatively, maybe the enol's conjugated system allows for the bromine to add in a way that forms a bromide at C2.

I'm not sure, but if I have to make an educated guess, perhaps the major product is option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, but I'm not very confident. Another thought: when enols react with Br2, they can form dibromides, but in the presence of certain conditions, the enol can revert to the ketone, leading to a bromide substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the ring becoming more substituted and the OH group being replaced.

But I'm not making progress. Another approach: check the number of options. There are four options, two di bromides and two ketones.

Given that bromine is a dienophile, but the starting material isn't a diene, perhaps the major reaction is the addition across the double bond, leading to the di bromide. So options A or D.

Then, considering the stereochemistry, bromine addition is anti, so the Brs would be on opposite faces.

In a cyclopentane ring, how would that look? Each Br would be on opposite faces of the ring, leading to a trans arrangement.

But cyclopentane rings are puckered, so the configuration could vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer with R and S configurations, which would be option A.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the di bromide, which is option A or D.

But I'm not certain, so I think I'll have to go with the di bromide option.

But looking again, the enol has a double bond and an OH. Adding Br across the double bond would lead to a vicinal di bromide, but the presence of OH on the same carbon as one Br is not possible. Oh wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so adding Br to each would have C1 with Br and C2 with Br, and C1 also has OH. So the structure would have Br on C1 and C2, with OH on C1.

Wait, that's not possible because C1 would have three substituents (ring, Br, OH). So perhaps the reaction isn't possible, and the product is a di bromide without the OH group.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting material has the OH group.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur as I thought. Maybe the enol is more reactive in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromohydrin, but in this case, the enol already has an OH.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B because the cyclopentanone is formed, and Br adds to the alpha position.

But I'm not certain. Another way: think about the reaction of cyclohexenol with Br2.

Wait, I recall that when cyclohexenol reacts with bromine, the addition occurs across the double bond, leading to a dibromide. But the OH is on the same carbon as one Br, leading to a vicinal di bromide. So perhaps the answer is a di bromide.

So, in this case, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the correct stereochemistry.

Looking at the options, options A and D are the possibilities.

Now, the stereochemistry would depend on whether the addition is syn or anti. Since bromine addition is typically anti, the two Brs would be on opposite faces.

In a cyclopentane ring, this would lead to a trans arrangement, which in the case of a cyclopentanol, would have the Brs in a trans configuration.

So, if the OH is on C1 and the Brs are on C1 and C2, their configurations would be opposite.

Assuming that the OH is in a certain configuration, the Brs would be opposite, leading to either R and S configurations on C1 and C2.

Looking at option A: (1R,2S). Option D: (1R,2R).

If the addition is anti, then the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face from the OH. But the OH is on C1, which is in a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps the OH is in the R configuration, and the Br on C1 is S, and Br on C2 is R, leading to (1S,2R). But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is (1R,2S) as in option A.

Hmm.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂). The starting material is a cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. Bromine typically reacts with alkenes via electrophilic addition, forming a vicinal dibromide. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group on C1 complicates the analysis.

Key considerations include:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The enol has a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. Bromine addition across the double bond would result in a vicinal dibromide, with Br atoms on C1 and C2. However, C1 already has an -OH group, which raises questions about steric and electronic effects.

2. **Mechanism of Bromine Addition**: Bromine addition to alkenes proceeds via a cyclic bromonium intermediate, leading to anti addition of the Br atoms. In a cyclopentene ring, this anti addition would result in a trans configuration of the Br atoms on C1 and C2.

3. **Stereochemistry**: The anti addition mechanism suggests that the Br atoms on C1 and C2 will be on opposite faces of the ring. This leads to a specific stereochemical outcome, with the configurations of the Br atoms determined by the geometry of the starting material.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This corresponds to a trans configuration of the Br atoms on C1 and C2, consistent with anti addition.
   - **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This corresponds to a cis configuration, which is inconsistent with the anti addition mechanism.
   - **Options B and C**: These involve mono-brominated ketones, which are unlikely because the reaction conditions do not suggest ketone formation or bromination at the alpha position.

Given the anti addition mechanism and the stereochemical outcome, the most plausible product is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Answer: A
