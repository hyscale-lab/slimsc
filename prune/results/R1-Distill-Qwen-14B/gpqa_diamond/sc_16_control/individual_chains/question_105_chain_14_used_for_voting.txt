Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They're comparing this to the effect a planet would have, and I need to find the planet's radius relative to the star.

Alright, so the setup: the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But the question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit, so they want to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness dip.

Wait, but wait. The problem says to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted. So the observed variation due to the spots is being compared to what a planet would do. So I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness for both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

Hmm, right. Let me think about how both dark spots and a planet cause a dip in brightness.

When a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is the area of the planet relative to the star. So the fractional change is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. So that's the planet's signal.

Now, the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, they make the star appear slightly dimmer. But because the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a periodic dip.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the difference between the star's normal brightness and when the spots are facing us. But wait, the spots cover a certain fraction of the star's surface. Since it's one hemisphere, the spots are on one side, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, which would cause a dip in brightness as that cooler area becomes visible.

Wait, but the problem states that the spots cover a filling factor of 20% in one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is spots. So the total area is (filling factor) * (area of hemisphere). The area of the hemisphere is 2π R^2, right? Because the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R².

So the area of the spotted region is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but I'm not sure if the calculation is that simple. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire stellar surface? Or 20% of the hemisphere? The question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So I think that's 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). So area of hemisphere is 2π R² (since R is star radius). So spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star's surface area is 4π R², so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, which is 10%. Oh, so the total spot coverage is 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, the star emits different fluxes from different regions. The spots are cooler, so when they are visible, the total flux is less.

So let's think about this. The star's luminosity when all spots are on the near side would be lower. The variation in brightness is the difference between the normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are visible.

The star's total luminosity when spots are visible is L = L0 * (1 - f), where f is the fraction of the surface that is spotted. Wait, no, because the spots are cooler, each spot emits less flux. So the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted areas and the flux from the rest of the surface.

Wait, the star's normal luminosity (when not spotted) is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But when the spots are visible, the flux from the spots is lower. The temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000K, which is 5000K.

So the flux from the spotted area is: (flux per unit area) * area. The flux per unit area for a blackbody is σ T^4. So the spotted area has σ (5000)^4 per unit area.

The non-spotted area is σ (6000)^4 per unit area.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is: (area of spots) * σ (5000)^4 + (area not spots) * σ (6000)^4.

The total area is 4π R². Let me denote the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots as f, which is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) / (total area). Wait, the hemisphere area is 2π R². So (0.2 * 2π R²) / (4π R²) ) = (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1. So f=0.1, 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

So the flux when spots are visible is: f * σ (5000)^4 + (1 - f) * σ (6000)^4.

The normal flux (without any spots) would be when the spots are on the far side, so the flux is (1 - f) * σ (6000)^4 + f * σ (6000)^4? No, wait no. Wait, normally, without any spots, the entire star is at 6000K. But in the case where spots are present, when the spots are facing us, they contribute at 5000K. When the spots are not facing us, their contribution is zero on the near side, but since the star is a sphere, whether the spots are on the far side doesn't affect the flux. So when the star is rotating, the area of the spots that are on the near side varies.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux as a function of the rotation. The maximum flux occurs when no spots are visible (facing us; but wait, no, the spots are cooler, so the maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side. The minimum flux occurs when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the star is observed to have periodic brightness variations due to rotation, and this is similar to a planet transit. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, creating a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip would be the difference between the normal flux (when all spots are on the far side) and the flux when spots are on the near side.

So the fractional change in brightness (ΔF/F) is [(F_max - F_min)/F_max ]? Or perhaps it's the amplitude, which would be (F_max - F_min) / F_max. Hmm, but when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F_min = F_normal - ΔF, where ΔF is the dip.

Wait, let me think again. The normal flux (without spots) is F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But when spots are present, the flux when the spots are on the near side is F_spots = ( (1-f) * 4π R^2 σ (6000)^4 ) + ( f * 4π R^2 σ (5000)^4 ) ) / 4π R^2.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flux as:

F = ( (1-f)*Teff^4 + f*(T_spot)^4 ) * σ * 4π R² / 4π R².

Wait, no, because each area contributes its own flux. So the total flux is the sum of the flux from the non-spotted area and the spotted area.

So the flux when spots are visible is: (non-spotted area) * flux per area (6000K) + (spotted area) * flux per area (5000K).

Which is (1 - f) * 4π R² * σ (6000)^4 + f * 4π R² * σ (5000)^4.

But 4π R² is the entire surface area, right? So the flux without any spots on the near side would be when all the surface is at 6000K, so F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When spots are present, F_spots = (1 - f) * 4π R² σ (6000)^4 + f * 4π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the change in flux is F0 - F_spots = 4π R² σ [ (1 - f)(6000^4) + f (5000^4) ) ].

Wait, no, wait. F0 is 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spots is (1 - f) * 4π R² σ (6000)^4 + f * 4π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the difference is F0 - F_spots = 4π R² σ [ (1) (6000^4) - ( (1 - f) 6000^4 + f *5000^4 ) ) ].

Let me compute that:

= 4π R² σ [ (6000^4) - ( (1-f) 6000^4 + f 5000^4 ) ]

= 4π R² σ [ 6000^4 - (6000^4 - f 6000^4 + f 5000^4 ) ]

= 4π R² σ [ 6000^4 -6000^4 + f 6000^4 - f 5000^4 ]

= 4π R² σ [ f (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

So the dip in flux is F0 - F_spots = 4π R² σ f (6000^4 - 5000^4 ).

The fractional change is (F0 - F_spots) / F0 = [ 4π R² σ f (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4π R² σ (6000^4) ) ]

Simplify this: [ f (6000^4 -5000^4) ) ] / (6000^4 )

Which is f * [ (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 ]

But wait, the star's brightness variation amplitude due to the spots would be this fractional change.

Wait, but in reality, when the star is rotating, only part of the spots come into view. Oh wait, no, in this problem, because the star is such that one hemisphere is spotted and the other isn't, when the star rotates, the spots come fully into view or go out of view. So the variation is that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spots. When it's the other hemisphere (unspotted), the flux is F0.

Wait, no. The star is rotating, so the facing hemisphere changes. The problem states that one hemisphere is spotty. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the near side, and the flux is F_spots. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing, the flux is higher, F0.

Wait, but actually, the star is a sphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the near side, so that area contributes less flux. The unspotted hemisphere is when the spotty side is on the far side, so the flux is higher.

Wait, no. No, the star is a sphere, so the area that is on the near side is a hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the near side can be the spotted hemisphere or the unspotted one.

Wait no, the way it's described is that one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is less. When the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the near side is unspotted, so flux is normal.

Wait no, perhaps. Let me think about a star as a sphere with two hemispheres: one covered with spots (covering 20% of that hemisphere, so 10% of the total surface), and the other hemisphere not spotted.

When the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is on the near side (facing us), then we see the spots. The flux would be F_spots = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire near side is a hemisphere (2π R² area). The spotted area is f * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spots = (unspotted area on near side) * flux per unit area + (spotted area) * flux per unit area.

Wait, the unspotted area on the near side is (hemisphere area) - (spotted area) = 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F_spots = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000^4) + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000^4 )

The total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (i.e., the near side is unspotted) is F_unspots = 2π R² * σ (6000^4 )

So the change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

ΔF = F_unspots - F_spots = [2π R² σ 6000^4 ] - [ 1.6π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.4π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= [2π R² σ 6000^4 ] - [1.6π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.4π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= (2π R² σ 6000^4 - 1.6π R² σ 6000^4 ) - 0.4π R² σ 5000^4

= (0.4π R² σ 6000^4 ) - 0.4π R² σ 5000^4 )

Factor out 0.4π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the fractional change is ΔF / F_unspots.

F_unspots is 2π R² σ 6000^4.

So:

(ΔF) / F_unspots = [ 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify:

(0.4 / 2) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4

0.2 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So fractional change is 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the amplitude is about 10.355% dip in brightness.

Wait, but wait. No, wait, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, so when the unspotted hemisphere is facing, flux is F_unspots = 2π R² σ 6000^4. When the spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is F_spots.

So the maximum flux is F_unspots and the minimum is F_spots.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is facing, the flux is lower, so it's the minimum. So the amplitude is (F_unspots - F_spots) / F_unspots, which is the fractional dip.

Which we calculated as ~10.355%, so about 0.1035.

Now, for the planet case. The planet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits the star. The dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_planet², and the star's area is π R_star², but wait no, the star's area is 4π R_star² because it's a sphere, but when blocking, it's the disk area, which is π R_star².

Wait, no. The dip in brightness is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk.

So the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So (R_planet / R_star)^2 = fractional dip.

We found that the fractional dip due to spots is about 0.1035. So we set (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.1035.

Then R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, so when the planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

Wait, no, no. When a planet transits a star, it blocks a part of the star's light. The star's area is 4π R_star² (full sphere), but the area we observe as the disk is π R_star². So the blocked area is π R_planet². So the fractional change is (π R_p²) / (π R_s² ) ) = (R_p / R_s )^2.

So yes, dip is (R_p/R_s )^2.

So in our case, the dip due to spots is about 0.1035, so (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.1035 → R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32. So option D is 0.32, which is the correct answer.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. This means 10% of the star's total surface area is covered by spots.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Planet Signal**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]

3. **Spot Signal**:
   - The spots cause a dip in brightness when they are on the near side of the star. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions:
     \[
     F_{\text{total}} = (1 - f) \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
     where \( f \) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots (\( f = 0.1 \)).
   - The normal flux (without spots) is:
     \[
     F_{\text{normal}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The fractional change in brightness is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 1 - \frac{(1 - f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 0.1 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482 \), so:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.482) = 0.1 \cdot 0.518 = 0.0518
     \]
     The fractional brightness dip due to the spots is approximately \( 0.0518 \).

### Equating Planet and Spot Signals:
To produce the same brightness variation, the planet's signal must match the spot's signal:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}}
\]
Substitute \( \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} \approx 0.0518 \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.227
\]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.227 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **0.32**.
