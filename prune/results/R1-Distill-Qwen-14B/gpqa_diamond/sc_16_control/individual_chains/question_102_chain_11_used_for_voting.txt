Okay, so I have this pretty detailed question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. They've done some genetic engineering using a bicistronic vector with loxP sites and Cre recombinase, and then they're looking for expression in mice. But when they try to visualize the GFP signal, there's nothing. So I need to figure out why that's happening.

First, let's go through the setup. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. There are stop cassettes between ligand and mCherry with loxP sites, and between receptor and eGFP with lox2272 sites.

Wait, I remember that loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites used with Cre to mediate recombination. LoxP is a wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant that only allows recombination when Cre is present. Oh wait, no, actually, lox2272 is a catalytic site variant that only recombines with loxP in the presence of Cre. So when Cre is present, it can cause the recombination between these sites.

So the vector is set up so that when Cre is expressed, it will delete the stop cassettes. That way, both the ligand and receptor can be expressed. But how does that work exactly? So the 5' ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, possibly constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES, which is an internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for translation without the need for a full set of mRNA processing, so it can sometimes drive expression even when the upstream part is not translated.

Let me think about how the expression works. The vector has the ligand's ORF first, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then the IRES, followed by the receptor ORF, and another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272). So when Cre is expressed, it will recombine the loxP sites, deleting the stop cassette, allowing the ligand to be expressed. It will also recombine the lox2272 sites, deleting the stop cassette for the receptor, allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under a promoter (CBA), so when the stop is removed, it can be expressed. The receptor is after an IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression. When Cre is present, the stops are removed, so both proteins are expressed. So the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

Now, the experiment: they transfected this plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. Then they did a Western blot using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. But in the Western blot, they see a signal proportional to actin loading. Hmm, so perhaps the proteins are being expressed. Because the blot uses total proteins, and the signal correlates with actin, which is a loading control, so the blot's working. So the ligand and receptor are being expressed.

But when they breed the mice homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background and cross them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring are born, and they visualize under confocal. They don't see a green signal. So the eGFP from the receptor isn't lighting up. So the question is why.

Possible options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act locally, but I don't see how that affects the expression in the mouse model. The construct is supposed to express both proteins in the same cell, perhaps. Or maybe in nearby cells. But the issue is expression in the mouse, not the signaling. So maybe not.

Option B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So the GFP isn't getting to the cell surface. If the eGFP is in the Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce when visualized, assuming the cells are fixed and permeabilized properly. But why would it be stuck? The vector is correctly processed? Maybe if the signal peptide is missing or something. But the construct is designed with the receptor being a transmembrane protein. If the eGFP is properly tagged at the C-terminus, it should be on the cell surface. Alternatively, maybe the receptor isn't properly processed, but that's a possibility.

Option C) Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression missing. The promoters are CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. The CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps they're using it to drive expression. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the ligand isn't being expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw the proteins expressed, so perhaps this isn't the issue.

Option D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh! So the ORF for the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the fusion is not in frame, the eGFP won't be properly expressed or the receptor might be truncated. For example, if the stop codon is present early due to frame shift, the eGFP won't be made. So when they look for GFP, they don't see anything.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette. But in the presence of Cre, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 would be removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed. But if the eGFP isn't in frame, perhaps the frame is messed up. Or maybe the eGFP is not correctly inserted.

Wait, the vector description says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is followed by eGFP? Or is the eGFP appended after the receptor? Oh, no, the question says the receptor is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the construct is Receptor-eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the fusion is in the wrong frame. So when Cre is used, the stop is removed, but if the receptor's ORF is followed by eGFP in the same frame, it's a fusion. If the stop is removed correctly, but the eGFP is not in frame, then the receptor might not be expressed, or the eGFP might not be made.

But wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector. The first ORF is ligand with mCherry, and the second is receptor with eGFP. Each has their own stop cassettes. So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing each ORF to be expressed as separate proteins.

Wait, but the way the question describes the vector is that the ligand is at 5' with mCherry, then a stop cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor with eGFP, then a stop cassette. So the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein. Because an IRES typically allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor would be expressed as a separate ORF, even if the ligand is not translated. Wait, no. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps the vector is set up for the ligand to be under the CBA promoter, followed by the IRES and the receptor. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate transcript, but perhaps from the same mRNA.

Wait, bicistronic vectors can have two ORFs under the same promoter but with IRES elements. So the mRNA is made from the CBA promoter, which then has the ligand ORF, then after the IRES, the receptor ORF. This way, ribosomes can translate both ORFs because the IRES allows internal initiation for the second ORF. So in this case, when the stop cassettes are removed by Cre, both ORFs would be expressed as separate proteins.

But the way the vector is described, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272). So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes block expression. When Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, so the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES.

Wait, but in that case, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES drives the receptor. So both would be expressed. However, the expression of the receptor would be dependent on the IRES.

But in the Western blot, they saw the proteins expressed, so the expression is working in culture. So the issue must be in the mouse model.

They crossed the homozygous mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would presumably express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, so that Cre is active in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

But in the question, the mouse model is homozygous for their construct. So the construct has both loxP and lox2272 sites. When they cross with SOX10-Cre mice, Cre would be expressed in the neural crest cells, leading to the recombination of the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes, and allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the offspring, they don't see the green signal (eGFP). So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So the ORF for the receptor and eGFP is in the same reading frame? Wait, no. The eGFP is fused to the receptor's C-terminus. So the construct would be Receptor-eGFP as a single ORF. If the eGFP is not in frame, the entire construct would produce a nonfunctional or truncated protein. For example, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP would not be expressed, and the receptor might be truncated.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they saw the proteins expressed. So if the eGFP was not expressed, the Western blot might detect the receptor, but maybe not the eGFP. But the question doesn't specify whether the blot was for the receptor or the eGFP. Oh, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps both proteins were detected on the blot, but in the mouse, only the receptor is expressed without eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps in the mouse, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette wasn't properly removed.

Wait, the construct is in the mouse, and the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. So the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, leading to the removal of the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why?

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't properly trafficked to the cell surface, then GFP wouldn't be visible. But why would that happen? Because the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it should traffic correctly. Unless the eGFP tag interferes with the trafficking. But that's speculative.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so enhancers might not be as crucial. Unless the promoter isn't functional in certain cells. But since the Western blot showed expression in culture, the promoter is working.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop cassette is removed, the eGFP might not be expressed, but the receptor could be. So in the mouse, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't. But in the Western blot, the antibodies would detect the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question says that the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are present. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, the Western blot might not pick it up, but the question says that the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins, so perhaps both proteins are present.

Wait, the way the vector is described, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So each is a separate fusion. So the ligand would be a fusion protein (ligand-mCherry), and the receptor would be a fusion protein (receptor-eGFP). So in the Western blot, using an antibody against the overexpressed proteins would detect either the ligand or the receptor. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, the Western would detect the receptor, but perhaps not the eGFP. But the problem says that the signal is proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the blot is working.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed, so the Western would detect the receptor (if the antibody is against the receptor) but not the eGFP. But the question states that the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins. So if both are expressed, both would be detected. But if only the receptor is expressed, the blot would show only that.

But the question states that in the mouse, they don't see the green signal, which is eGFP. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. The receptor is under an IRES, so perhaps the IRES isn't functional in the mouse's cells. But in the culture, it worked because the IRES allowed expression. Maybe cell type-specific differences? But in the mouse, SOX10 is active in neural crest cells, which is where the IRES should function.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly inserted into the construct. If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor might be expressed, but the eGFP is not. So in the Western blot, perhaps they detected the receptor, but not the eGFP. But if the antibody is against the overexpressed proteins, which are the ligand and receptor fusions, maybe the eGFP isn't part of the antibody target.

Wait, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the overexpressed proteins are the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. If the eGFP isn't expressed, then the receptor would be expressed as a wild-type receptor, but perhaps not fused to eGFP. So the Western antibody would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP, unless the antibody is against the receptor itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the frame is wrong. So when the vector is transfected, the eGFP isn't made because the ORF is not correct. But why would the Western blot detect the proteins? Because the ligand and receptor are expressed as separate proteins. Wait, no, the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP.

Wait, maybe in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, followed by a stop, then IRES, followed by the receptor with eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed. So the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is expressed as a separate protein. So both would be present in the cell.

But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present, so the stops aren't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells.

Wait, the construct is homozygous, so both alleles are present. The Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which would be active in the neural crest cells. So the Cre should be expressed, leading to the removal of the stop cassettes.

Unless the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present, but that seems unlikely.

Another angle: the IRES isn't working. The receptor is under an IRES, so in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, but the IRES may not allow the receptor to be translated. So the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But in the Western blot, the proteins were expressed when transfected into astrocytes. So IRES works in astrocytes, but perhaps not in the mouse's neural crest cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is cell-type specific. But IRES elements are usually not dependent on cell type but on other factors like stress or presence of certain factors.

Another thought: the vector is set up as a bicistronic vector, but perhaps the presence of the IRES and the stop cassettes affects the expression in the mouse. Alternatively, maybe the vectors weren't properly excised because of the lox sites.

Wait, the stop cassette for the ligand is loxP-stop-loxP, and for the receptor, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. Cre is an enzyme that recognizes loxP sites. Since the receptor's stop cassette uses lox2272, which is a variant, Cre can still recombine it, but only when paired with a loxP site. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a site that can recombine with loxP in the presence of Cre. But in this case, each stop cassette is flanked by the same type of lox sites. So the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So Cre can recombine both.

Wait, but the Cre from the SOX10-Cre would have to recognize both. So in the presence of Cre, both stop cassettes would be removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the ORF is not correctly in frame.

Wait, the ORF for the receptor is followed by eGFP. So perhaps the stop cassette was not correctly spliced out, or the frame is wrong. If the eGFP is not in frame, then the receptor might be expressed as a truncated protein, and eGFP isn't made.

But why would the Western blot detect the proteins? Because the ligand and receptor are expressed. Unless the antibodies are against the tags, mCherry and eGFP, but the Western blot would require other methods. Wait, the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the overexpressed proteins are the ligand and receptor, not the tags. So if the eGFP is not expressed, the receptor is expressed as a wild-type, but the eGFP isn't. So the Western blot would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP. But the question says the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is working, but perhaps the eGFP isn't detected.

Wait, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong. So the ORF for the receptor was followed by the eGFP, but in the vector, the eGFP is not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the mouse, the receptor is present, but eGFP isn't. Therefore, when they look for green fluorescence (eGFP), they don't see it.

So which option is that? Looking at the options:

Option D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Yes, that's the possibility. If the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, then the eGFP isn't expressed, so the green signal isn't seen.

Another possibility is that the Cre didn't recombine the sites. So the stop cassettes are still present, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw the proteins, which suggests that the stops were removed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre is expressed, so the stops should be removed. So the issue is that even though the stops are removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because it's out of frame.

So the correct answer is D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptor) are present to block expression in the absence of Cre. Upon Cre expression, these stop cassettes are removed, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre in neural crest cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act locally. However, the issue is not about signaling but the lack of eGFP expression in the mouse model. The paracrine relationship does not explain why the eGFP signal is absent.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were improperly trafficked to the Golgi, it might not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, there is no evidence in the question to suggest trafficking issues. The Western blot shows protein expression, indicating proper synthesis and processing.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is driven by an IRES. The Western blot confirms expression in astrocyte culture, indicating that the promoters are functional. Therefore, the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression in the mouse.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, it would not be expressed as a functional protein. This would result in the receptor being expressed without eGFP, which aligns with the observation of no green signal under confocal microscopy. The Western blot detects the receptor, but the eGFP would not be expressed due to the frame mismatch.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame with the receptor, preventing its expression. This accounts for the lack of green fluorescence in the mouse model while still allowing the receptor to be expressed and detected in the Western blot.
