Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. The given concentration is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex is usually 1:1, right? So Ca-EDTA would mean that each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, Kf, is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- . So the Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4- ]). 

In this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But in solution, some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the problem states it's a stochiometric solution. Stochiometric probably means that the concentrations of the reactants are in the exact molar ratio needed for the reaction to go to completion. So, if the solution is stochiometric, that might imply that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are present in a 1:1 ratio, but considering the complex is formed.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that's the total concentration of the complex. So the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA would relate based on how much the complex dissociates.

But if the complex doesn't dissociate much, because Kf is really large (5e10), that would mean the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So, the initial assumption is that the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca²+] is approximately x, and [EDTA] is also approximately x, and [CaEDTA] is approximately 0.02 - x, but since x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Wait, but wait. If the solution is stochiometric, does that mean that before any dissociation, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are each 0.02 M? No, that would be a 1:1 ratio. But wait, if you have a complex that's 0.02 M, then the total concentration of Ca and EDTA would be 0.02 M each, but that can't be right because some of them form the complex. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding 'stochiometric solution'.

Wait, no. In a stochiometric solution, the amounts of the reactants are exactly in the proper ratio to form the product. So, for each mole of Ca²+ added, a mole of EDTA is added, leading to the formation of Ca-EDTA. So, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it might dissociate a little.

But because Kf is so large, the dissociation is going to be very small. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So, let's model this. Let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M. Let's say the complex dissociates to some small extent, releasing x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4-.

So, the equilibrium expressions would be:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Substituting into the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, so 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) → approximately 1.414e-6.5? Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x=2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5 → but 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute that again. 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) ) → 2 x 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) → 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 x 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any step I missed? The initial assumption was that x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Since Kf is so large, x is indeed negligible. So the calculation should hold.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). Let the concentration of free calcium ions and free EDTA ions at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the solution is stochiometric and the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K_f \)), the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
