Okay, let's see. I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, the options are all different chemical formulas. Let's break down each piece of data provided.

First, the FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the question says "very broad"—maybe it's a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are broader than alcohols. Alternatively, could it be an alcohol? Not sure yet. Also, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ketone. Or maybe it's an ester or something with conjugated groups.

Next, the 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere, perhaps as part of a conjugated system with the carbonyl. Maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like in an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. 45 is a common mass. Let me think, the molecular ion might break down into fragments. 45 could correspond to a fragment like (CH3COO^-) which is 45? Wait, wait, molecular weight of CH3COO is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2= 24+3+32=59? No, wait that's wrong. Wait, CH3COO^-: carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, oxygen 16. So CH3COO is C2H3O2. So 2*12=24, 3*1=3, 2*16=32. Total 24+3+32=59. Hmm, doesn't match m/z 45. Maybe another fragment. What about a CH2O group? Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, 45 can be the molecular ion of something else. Let's think about common fragments. Another possibility is the acetic acid ion, but that's 60. Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3COO-) but that's 59. Maybe it's the methyl ester, but I'm not getting that.

Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CH2O group? No, the molecular weight for that is 45 (12*2 +1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46. Hmm, not that either. Or maybe a CH2=CH- group? No, that's 28. Wait, maybe the fragment is something else. Oh, wait, another approach: the m/z 45 could correspond to a specific functional group. For example, if the compound has a ketone group, the fragments might involve breaking at the carbonyl. Or perhaps a loss of something.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. For C6H12O2: Hydrogens expected for a fully saturated molecule would be 2n+2 = 2*(6)+2=14. But here we have 12, so 2 less, which is two degrees of unsaturation. So that could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's at least one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: 2n+2 =14. Actual H=10, so 4 less. 4/2=2 degrees. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2n+2 =14. H=10, so 4 less. So two degrees. Wait, 10 is 4 less than 14, so 2 degrees. So same as above.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: 2n+2=14. H=12, so 2 less, 1 degree. So either a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So options with at least one degree of unsaturation. All except D have at least one? Wait no: D is 1 degree, which could be a double bond. So that's possible.

Now, the FTIR: strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is likely a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

The broad peak at 3000 could be an O-H stretch. So if the compound has an ester group (O in carbonyl and O in ester oxygen), or maybe a ketone and an alcohol? No, the formula includes O's. Let's look at the options. For example, if the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the structure could be an ester, which has two oxygen atoms. An ester group would have a carbonyl (around 1700) and an O that's part of the ester linkage.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Like methyl acrylate or similar. That would have the structure CH2=CHCOO-R, but wait, let's think about the formula.

Alternatively, could it be a cyclic ester, which is a lactone? A lactone would have an ester group and a ring. But I'm not sure.

Another thing: the IR peak at 1700 is strong, which aligns with an ester or ketone. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Now the mass spectrum: m/z 45. Let's see, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. If there's a fragment at 45, perhaps that's a part of the molecule. Let's think about common fragmentations.

In esters, a common fragment is the acylium ion. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' might lose the R group to form the acylium ion (COOR'), which would have a molecular weight of (COOR').

Wait, but 45 is a low mass. Let me think about possible fragments. For C6H10O2, possible fragments could be a smaller ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be a (CH3COO-) group, which is 59. No, that's too high. Wait, what about (CH2O) group? No, that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the fragment at m/z 45. Let's calculate possible formulas. 45 has a molecular weight of 45. So possible combinations:

Carbon: 3, since 3*12=36, leaving 9 which would be H and O. Wait, 3 carbons: C3HxOy.

Looking for 3*12 + x + 16y =45.

So 36 +x +16y =45 → x +16y =9.

Possible y values: y=0 →x=9 → C3H9 (but that's 36+9=45).

But 3 carbons and 9 H: C3H9 is possible, but that's an unstable radical, perhaps. Alternatively, y=0 and x=9: that's 3 carbons and 9 H. Or y=1: x= -7, which is impossible.

So the fragment is likely C3H9. But wait, the molecular formula of the unknown is either C6H12O2, etc.

Wait, but maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group? Wait, that's ethylene glycol? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an acetylium ion, which is CH3CO+. That's 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Close but not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion (O=C=O), but that's a different story.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2O group (formaldehyde), which is 30. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula might have a methyl group attached to something else. Maybe the peak at 45 is the result of losing some part of the molecule. For example, if the compound is an ester, it might lose the R group and leave the acylium ion.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula for each option and see what possible fragments could give m/z 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 6*12=72, 12 H=12, 2 O=32 → total 116. So molecular ion is 116. If it breaks to form a fragment of 45, the remaining would be 71. That's possible, but why would the fragment be 45?

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight: 6*12=72, 10 H=10, 2 O=32 → 114. So if it breaks into 45 and 69, perhaps. If the 45 is a part of the molecule. But what could that be? Maybe a 3-carbon fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that upon cleavage, a smaller ester group is formed. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a longer chain, maybe the fragment is an acylium ion of a smaller ester.

Wait, another approach: the 45 could be a CH3COO fragment. Wait, molecular weight of CH3COO is 59. Hmm, not matching. Unless it's a different group.

Wait, thinking about the 1H NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So perhaps the compound is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, such as methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). Let's see the formula of methyl acrylate: C4H6O2. Molecular weight is 88. But that's for the pure acrylate. Wait, but the options here are for a six-carbon compound.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl ester or something like that. For example, if the formula is C6H10O2, maybe it's an ester with a double bond. Let's think: maybe it's a six-carbon ester with a double bond somewhere.

But perhaps another approach would be to look at the degrees of unsaturation. For each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 - (2*O))/2. Wait, the formula is CnHmOp. Degrees of unsaturation = (2n +2 - m - p)/2. So for option A: n=6, m=12, p=2. So (14-12-2)/2 =0. So zero degrees of unsaturation? No, that can't be right because we have a double bond (vinyl H's). Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the formula is C6H12O2.

Wait, the correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. So one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows a double bond. So this could be a single double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. So could be two double bonds, one ring and one double bond, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2. (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees of unsaturation. So same as option B.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond. So all options except D have at least one double bond, but D has one. So D is possible only if that's the double bond.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650, which suggests a conjugated carbonyl, so likely a double bond nearby.

So, for the options, the structure must have a carbonyl group and a double bond, possibly conjugated.

Looking at the options again, the IR data is strong at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (maybe conjugated). So the compound must have a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Option C is C6H10O2. So with 2 degrees of unsaturation, which could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. If the other degree is a ring, that could make sense. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent double bond. Or perhaps a ring and a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have a conjugated system. For example, an ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Now, let's think about the mass spectrum. The presence of a fragment at m/z 45 may help. Let me think about esters and their common fragments.

In an ester molecule, the cleavage can occur at the ester group. For example, the molecule can break into the acylium ion and the alkoxide part. The acylium ion would have a mass equal to the acyl group (RCO+). So if the acyl group is, say, CH2CH2COO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The fragment at 45 could be a (CH3COO-) group, but wait, that's 59. So perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the options. Let's see which formula could give a fragment of 45.

For example, take option C: C6H10O2. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible fragments could be:

- If it breaks between the carbonyl and the R group, the acylium ion would be a certain mass. Let's say the ester is R-O-CO-R', the fragment could be CO-R', which would have a molecular weight of (CO-R').

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller molecule, like an ethylene group or something else.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula again. Let's calculate the possible mass of the fragment.

The fragment is 45, which could be C3H7O2? No, because 3*12 +7 +32=36+7+32=75. No, that's too high. Alternatively, maybe it's C2H5O, which would be 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! That's exactly 45. So a fragment with the formula C2H5O.

Hmm, so a fragment with the formula C2H5O would have a mass of 45. What kind of functional group would that be? Well, ethyl alcohol's molecular weight is 46 (C2H5OH). But that fragment is C2H5O, which is 45. Maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene ion (O=C=O) but that's 44. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. That's C2H4O. Molecular weight: 2*12 +4 +16=24+4+16=44. Not 45. Close, but not exactly.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propenyl group or something else. Another possibility is that the fragment is a (CH2O) group, which is 30. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible structures of each option and see which one fits all the data.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's think about the structure. It has two oxygen atoms. Possible structures: ester, ketone plus another oxygen-containing group, etc.

If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, let's count the carbons. If the ester is RCOOR', where R is CH2CH=CH... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the possibility of the molecule being a diester, but that might complicate things.

Another point: the FTIR's broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group, but wait, the options might have other structures. For example, if the compound is an ester, which doesn't have an -OH group. But the broad peak could also be from an -OH in an alcohol or acid.

Wait, but the options with O2 are C and A. So if the compound is an ester (C or A), then it doesn't have an -OH group, so why is there a broad peak at 3000? Maybe it's an -OH from something else. Or perhaps the broad peak is from an amide N-H, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, the peak could be from an aldehyde's O-H stretch, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a broad O-H from a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H.

Wait, maybe the broad peak at 3000 is not O-H but an N-H stretch. But the options don't have N, so that's probably not it. Alternatively, it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, wait. If the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), it would have an ester group but no free -OH. So the broad peak would have to come from somewhere else. Maybe it's an -OH from an alcohol group elsewhere, but if the formula is C6H10O2, that would require another O, which it doesn't have. Wait, no, O is two. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an alcohol group. So if the formula is C6H10O, which is option B, then O is one. But then the other peaks (1700 and 1650) would require a carbonyl group. Let's see: a carbonyl would require an O, so in option B, which has one O, that's possible only if it's a ketone. Then, the IR at 1700 is a ketone, and 1650 could be a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but then the O is just one, so the broad peak would be the alcohol. So perhaps the compound is a ketone and a secondary alcohol? But then the formula would have two O's. Wait, option B is C6H10O, which has one O. So that can't have both a ketone and an alcohol group because that would require two O's. So that's not possible. Hmm.

So maybe the broad peak isn't from an O-H. Wait, another possibility: the peak at 3000 is from an N-H stretch, but the options don't have nitrogen. Alternatively, it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. But then the formula would have at least two O's: one for the acid (COOH) which is two O's. Let's check the options. Options C and A have two O's.

Wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would need at least one O for the -COOH. But in that case, the other O could be part of another group. Wait, but then the molecular formula for a hexanoic acid would be C6H12O2. That's option A. But then the IR would show a broad O-H around 3000. That fits. Then, the 1700 cm^-1 would be the carbonyl of the acid. But wait, the question says two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Carboxylic acids have a strong carbonyl around 1700, but what about 1650? Maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond.

But the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So if the compound is a hexanoic acid with a double bond somewhere, would that fit?

Wait, but option A is C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. For n=6: C6H12O2. That matches option A. So if it's a hexanoic acid with a double bond elsewhere, but wait, hexanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. If it has a double bond, say, CH2CH2 somewhere, that would reduce the number of H's. Let me think: each double bond reduces two H's. So the formula for a hexanoic acid with one double bond would be C6H10O2, which is option C. But option A is C6H12O2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it differently.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is probably O-H. So the compound has an O-H group. So options with at least one O. All except option B have at least two O's. Wait, no: option D is C6H12O, which has O=1. So if the O-H is present, then the formula must have at least one O. So options A, C, D have O.

If the O is in a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the O count would need to be at least one for the ketone plus one for the O-H (alcohol), making two O's. So that would require the formula to have two O's. So options A and C.

Option D has one O, which could be a ketone and an O-H group. So O is in a ketone (O) and an O-H (another O), but then the formula would require two O's, but option D only has one. So that's not possible. So D is out.

So between options A, B, C.

But earlier analysis says the O-H is present, so the formula must have at least one O. So B has one O, but IR has O-H and a carbonyl. So if B is correct, the compound must have both O-H and a carbonyl group, which would require two O's. But B only has one O, so that's impossible. So B is eliminated.

So the possible options are A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2= (14-14)/2=0. So zero degrees of unsaturation. But wait, that can't be because the NMR shows vinyl H's, implying a double bond. So option A can't be correct because that would have zero degrees, meaning all single bonds and no rings. So that's a problem. Unless it's a ring, but that would require one degree. So option A can't have a double bond, which is required by the NMR. So option A is out.

That leaves option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation for C: (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond or a ring. Plus, the NMR has vinyl H's, so the double bond is present. So one degree from the double bond, another from where? Oh wait, earlier I thought the formula had two degrees.

Wait, degrees of unsaturation for option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 - 2*2)/2? No, wait, the formula is (2n +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or two rings.

But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so at least one double bond. So the other degree could be a ring.

So the structure could be a cyclic compound with a double bond, such as a cyclic ketone with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it could be an ester with a double bond. Let's say it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

So putting it all together:

FTIR: Broad O-H suggests either alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the compound has two O's, so if it's an ester, it would have O in the ester group, but then where is the O-H? Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of an alcohol group, and the other O is part of an ester or ketone.

Wait, but for option C, the formula is C6H10O2. It could have an ester group (O) and an alcohol group (O). But then the O count would be two, which matches the formula. So the structure would have both an ester and an alcohol. But that's possible but not very common. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require two O's.

But let's think about the IR. If the compound has an ester group, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 cm^-1 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So that fits.

The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is O-H from an alcohol group. So the structure would be an alcohol with an ester group and a conjugated double bond.

But wait, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group somewhere else, then yes. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond.

Alternatively, the O-H is from an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid, but that would require a COOH group. But then the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A, but that's not possible because option A has zero degrees of unsaturation, but we have a double bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the mass spectrum again. The fragment at 45 could correspond to a specific group. For example, if the structure is an ester where the acylium ion is of a three-carbon group, like propenoate.

Wait, the molecular formula of the acylium ion would be CxHyOz. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O), which has a mass of 44. Close to 45, but not matching.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is C6H10O2. Let's see if this can produce a fragment of 45. The molecular weight is 114. So 114 -45 =69. So the parent ion loses 45 and leaves a fragment of 69.

If the parent is C6H10O2, and a fragment is C3H7O2, that would be 3*12=36 +7=43 +32=79. No. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is C2H5O2, which is 2*12 +5 +32=24+5+32=61. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2O. No, that would be 44.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3COO^+ (43). Close to 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group (15) and another group. Not matching.

I'm getting stuck on the mass spec part. Maybe I should proceed with the other data and see which option fits.

The NMR has vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. The IR has a carbonyl and a conjugated peak. The FTIR's broad peak suggests an O-H group.

So option C: C6H10O2.

If that's the case, the structure likely has an ester group (O), an O-H group (like an alcohol), and a double bond. Or perhaps a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require more O's.

Another possibility is that the O-H is part of a hemiacetal, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, the O-H could be part of a carboxylic acid group, but earlier that didn't fit because of the formula.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. If it's a diol with a ketone, that would require more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Putting it all together, the most plausible option is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^-$, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm$^-$ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. The $^1$H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which could correspond to a smaller fragment such as CH$_3$COO$^+$ (43) or a related group.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**  
   - Molecular weight: 116.  
   - Degrees of unsaturation: 0 (no double bonds or rings).  
   - This contradicts the $^1$H NMR data, which shows vinyl hydrogens (indicating at least one double bond).  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: C$_6$H$_{10}$O**  
   - Molecular weight: 98.  
   - Degrees of unsaturation: 2 (one double bond and one ring or two double bonds).  
   - The single oxygen atom cannot account for both the O-H group and the carbonyl group observed in the FTIR spectrum.  
   - **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**  
   - Molecular weight: 114.  
   - Degrees of unsaturation: 2 (one double bond and one ring or two double bonds).  
   - The two oxygen atoms can account for both the O-H group (alcohol or carboxylic acid) and the carbonyl group (ester or ketone). The presence of vinyl hydrogens aligns with the double bond, and the conjugated system can explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm$^-$).  
   - The fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a smaller fragment, such as CH$_3$COO$^+$ (43), consistent with an ester group.  
   - **Plausible.**

4. **Option D: C$_6$H$_{12}$O**  
   - Molecular weight: 100.  
   - Degrees of unsaturation: 1 (one double bond or one ring).  
   - The single oxygen atom cannot account for both the O-H group and the carbonyl group observed in the FTIR spectrum.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The most consistent option is **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, as it accounts for the O-H group, the carbonyl group, the vinyl hydrogens, and the fragment at m/z = 45. This formula suggests a structure with an ester group, a double bond, and possibly a ring or conjugated system.

**Answer: C**
