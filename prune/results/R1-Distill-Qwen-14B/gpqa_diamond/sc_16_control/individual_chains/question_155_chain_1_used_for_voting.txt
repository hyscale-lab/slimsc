Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt( <A²> - <A>² ). So I'll need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but the operator we're looking at is P_z. Since the basis is of P_z, the matrix representations are in that basis, right? So the state vector is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which might simplify things.

First, let me write down the given state vector. It's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ a, b, c ]^T where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Since the basis is in terms of P_z's eigenvectors, the eigenvalues of P_z are probably along the diagonal of its matrix. Looking back, P_z's matrix is [ [ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0,0,-ħ] ]. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ respectively.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So, when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, it's just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, that's right. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are the squares of the amplitudes.

So let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. The expectation value is |a|² * (ħ) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ). Let's compute each term.

|a|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ = ħ/4.

|b|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So that term is 1/2 * 0 = 0.

|c|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So that term is 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero.

Now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is the same as taking each diagonal element squared. So the matrix of P_z squared would have entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 on the diagonal, which is ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a|²*(ħ²) + |b|²*0 + |c|²*(ħ²).

Calculating each term:

|a|² * ħ² = (1/4) ħ²
|b|² * 0 = 0
|c|² * ħ² = (1/4) ħ²

Adding them gives (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Now, to find ΔP_z, I compute sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, it's just sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, that would make the uncertainty ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Let me double-check my steps. The state is in the P_z basis, so the expectation values can be calculated directly from the coefficients. For ⟨P_z⟩, each component is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. The middle component (b) is 1/√2, and since its eigenvalue is 0, it doesn't contribute. The other components contribute with positive and negative ħ, but they cancel out because their amplitudes have the same magnitude. So yes, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |a|²*(ħ²) + |c|²*(ħ²) because the middle term is zero. Each |a|² and |c|² is 1/4, so 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Multiply by ħ² gives ½ ħ². The square root of that is ħ over root 2.

So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the basis vectors $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the same basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
