Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where the compounds are not mirror images of each other, leading to different physical properties like their rotation of plane-polarized light. But wait, I think optical isomerism specifically refers to compounds that have chiral centers, right? So they must be non-superimposable mirror images, meaning they have a plane of symmetry or not.

Let me go through each option one by one.

The question lists four moieties:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the options are combinations of these. Let's tackle each compound:

1. For the first one, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, I'm trying to visualize the structure. It's a biphenyl system, which means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. Also, there are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The ester groups are at 2 and 2', and they are dimethyl, so each is a methyl ester.

Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, like the coplanar (disubstituted) or non-coplanar. But for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or a different kind of asymmetry. Let me think: in biphenyls, sometimes the substituents can lead to atropisomerism if the rings are not free to rotate. So if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry but the arrangement around the central bond makes it chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', which are across from each other on each ring. So, the substituents on each ring are in positions that might make the biphenyl have a certain symmetry. Wait, let me think: if the substituents are in symmetrical positions, like para on each ring, would that allow for atropisomerism? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the two ester groups are on the same side or something. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Oh wait, if the substituents are opposite on each ring, like at the 2 and 6 positions, maybe they cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possibility of atropisomerism. For a biphenyl to have atropisomers, the molecule needs to have a sufficiently high barrier to rotation around the central bond. The substituents would have to be such that when rotated, the molecule becomes a chiral version. So, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the two rings' substituents not mirror images when rotated 180 degrees, then the molecule could be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro group at 6, which is opposite to the ester group at 2. Wait, 6 is para to 2 on each ring. So, each ring would have the ester at 2 and nitro at 6. So, each ring has substituents across from each other. When looking at the biphenyl, the two rings are connected at 1 and 1'. So, the arrangement would have each ring with a nitro and ester group on opposite sides. Hmm, perhaps the arrangement is symmetrical, making the molecule achiral. Or maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that they can't be rotated to a mirror image, then it could have optical isomerism. I'm a bit unsure about this one. I'll come back to it after looking at the others.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate means the hydroxyl is on carbon 2 of propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3

Wait, or is it CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons. So:

The formula is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, perhaps it's (CH3)CO-OH on the second carbon? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Propanoate: the ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, because in propanoate, the carbonyl is on the first carbon. So, the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O-OCH3

But wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)
|
CH2-COOCH3

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbon chain is methyl ester (COOCH3), and on the adjacent (beta) carbon is a hydroxyl group.

Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but then does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the carbon with the OH would be the second carbon. Let's count the substituents around that carbon.

The second carbon: attached to a CH2OH, a CH2COOCH3, and two other CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O-OCH3

But wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2COOCH3.

But methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon.

So, structure:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the second carbon) would have the following groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3, and another H? Let me see: No, wait, the second carbon in propanoate is actually the middle carbon. So, the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no: Wait, the numbering is from the carbonyl. So, propanoate is:

1      2      3
O=C-OCH3, and the other two carbons are on either side.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as:

The carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1. So, the propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

But 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the second carbon: so the middle carbon has OH.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, if the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, then the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH2) has an OH group attached. So, the substituents on the second carbon are: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, each carbon is connected to four atoms. So, the second carbon would have:

- One bond to the first carbon (CH2)
- One bond to the third carbon (CH2)
- One OH group
- And one more bond? Wait, no, that's only three. Oh, wait, maybe it's the middle carbon, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and the carboxylic ester group.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH2) has two CH2 groups (since it's CH2 in the middle), but that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O-OCH3.

But with an OH on the adjacent carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the molecule as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH2) has four substituents: two CH2 groups (from either side), an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, but each carbon can only have four bonds. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2 group)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- An OH group
- And another CH2 group? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, let me think about the actual structure. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (from the COOCH3) is CH2, which has two CH2 groups and an OH. Wait, but that's three substituents. Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- An OH group
- Another CH3 (no, wait, the third carbon is a COOCH3, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong).

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the middle one) is a CH2 group. So, it has two CH2 groups (left and right), an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, but that would make four substituents. So, the second carbon has four substituents: two CH2 groups (left and right), an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, but that would mean that the second carbon is connected to four different groups? Let's see:

Wait, each substituent is:

- One bond to the first carbon (CH2-)
- One bond to the third carbon (CH2COOCH3)
- One OH group
- And another CH2 group attached where?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

The second carbon is connected to:

- One OH group
- Two CH2 groups (on either side)
- The COOCH3 group.

Wait, that would make four substituents. So, the second carbon has:

- CH2-OH
- CH2-COOCH3
- Two more CH2 groups? No, that's not right. Oh wait, perhaps it's better to think of the central carbon as having four different groups: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. But wait, if the CH2 groups are on either side, aren't they symmetrical? So, if the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups), then it can't be a chiral center because it would have two identical substituents. Oh! Right, that's a key point. If the two substituents are the same, then the carbon can't be chiral.

So, in this case, the central carbon has two CH2 groups attached, which are identical. So, the groups around that carbon would be: two CH2 groups (same), an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Since two substituents are the same, the carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, but wait! Let me think again. The structure is:

The second carbon is connected to the first carbon (CH2-), the third carbon (COOCH3), an OH, and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (CH3)COO-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the second carbon is CH2, connected to the first (CH2), the third (COOCH3), an OH, and another CH2? No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the correct IUPAC name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right because propanoate has three carbons. Let me think again.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- An OH group
- Another CH2 group? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the second carbon is CH, not CH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me try to write the structure properly. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, in 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the OH is on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the second carbon (the middle one), which is CH2. So, that carbon is connected to:

1. The first carbon (CH2 group)
2. The third carbon (COOCH3 group)
3. An OH group
4. Another CH2 group? Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups, but how? Wait, no, because the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2-)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- And two H's? Or is it something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is CH2, connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (from either side)
- An OH group
- And a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that can't be because a carbon can't have five bonds. Hmm, I'm clearly getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. Let's think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- One ester group (COOCH3)
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH2. So, the substituents are:

- One CH2 group (from the first carbon)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (from the third carbon)
- One OH group
- And one H? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps I've got the substituents wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the second carbon is CH2. So, substituents on the second carbon: two CH2 groups (from the first and third), an OH, and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, that would make four substituents, but two of them (the CH2 groups) are the same. So, the substituents are:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- OH
- H?

Wait, no, perhaps that's another way. Maybe the second carbon is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2)
- The third carbon (COOCH3)
- OH
- And another CH2 group?

Hmm, I'm really confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- An OH group
- A COOCH3 group.

But that would mean four substituents, with two being identical (the two CH2 groups). So, the second carbon has two identical substituents, meaning it's not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because sometimes even with two identical substituents, it's possible to have a chiral center if the other substituents are different. Wait, no, for a carbon to be chiral, all four substituents must be different. So, if two substituents are the same, then it's not a chiral center. So, in this case, the second carbon has two CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH(OH)CH3. No, that would be a different compound. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3, which would make the second carbon CH2, with substituents including two CH2 groups, OH, and COOCH3. So, again, two substituents are same, so no chiral center. So, this compound (option 2) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, I might be wrong here. Let me think again. If the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the second carbon (CH(OH)) would have substituents: OH, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups. No, that's not right. Wait, that's if the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOCH2COOCH2CH3, which would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the second carbon is the CH2 in the middle. So, substituents would be:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- OH
- And another CH3? No, that can't be. I'm getting more confused now. Well, I'll have to proceed, but perhaps I should move on and come back to this.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)CO(Ph). So, two benzene rings connected to a ketone group. The structure is (C6H5)2CO.

Does benzophenone have any chiral centers? No, because all the carbons are either aromatic (sp2 hybridized) or part of the ketone (the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's sp2 hybridized as well). So, no chiral centers. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. Wait, no: Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, and maleic acid is the cis. Wait, no: Wait, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric is trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But wait, the structure of fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, the structure is:

O
||          O
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3
   \        /
    C=C
   /        \
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans di-ester. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's wrong. No, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When esterified, it becomes (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
  \
   C=CH
  /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

But I'm not getting the structure exactly right, but the key point is that dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this molecule have any stereoisomerism? Since the double bond is in the trans configuration, but that's for the acid. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So, when esterified, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but if both substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (i.e., each has two ester groups), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure: each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) has two ester groups attached. For example, each carbon is connected to two OCH3 groups. So, the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2C=C.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)2 on each end of a double bond. So, the molecule would have a central double bond with two COOCH3 groups on each carbon. So, each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
C=C
    /
COOCH3

But each C in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps each C has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group. Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The structure is (CH2COOCH3)2 across the double bond. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3). Wait, no, because that would require each CH to have two ester groups, which isn't possible with a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)2 connected by a double bond. So, each CH2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups, and they are connected by a double bond. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)2=CH2(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be right either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on either side of a double bond. Now, does this create any stereoisomerism?

Wait, in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is trans. Wait, but wait—does this create any stereoisomerism? Because the double bond is itself a geometric isomer, but since both substituents on each carbon are the same (each has two COOCH3 groups), the molecule would be symmetrical. Wait, no—if each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups, then the molecule would be symmetric, and thus not chiral. But wait, that's not correct. Let me think: if each carbon in the double bond has the same substituents, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if each carbon has two ester groups, the molecule would be symmetric, and thus it would not have any stereoisomerism. But wait, in reality, fumarate is the trans diacid, and when esterified, the trans configuration remains. But in this case, does the molecule have any stereogenic centers? Or does it have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, another approach: if the molecule is symmetric, then it can't be chiral. If dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule has a central double bond (trans configuration) with two ester groups on each carbon. Each carbon has two ester groups and two CH3 groups from the esters. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, meaning it's not chiral. But wait, that can't be right because fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Wait, but maleate is the cis isomer. So, dimethyl maleate would have the two ester groups on the same side, and dimethyl fumarate would have them on opposite sides. But in both cases, each carbon has two ester groups, so the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. So, both diastereomers (cis and trans) would be achiral, which doesn't make sense. Wait, but I must be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has any stereogenic centers. Wait, the carbons in the double bond are each attached to two ester groups, so each has two identical substituents. So, they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not so sure. Because sometimes, even without chiral centers, a molecule can be chiral due to other factors, like planar chirality or axial chirality, such as in allenes or certain bridged compounds. But in this case, the molecule is a trans-diesters across a double bond. Let me think: in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but does that create any asymmetry?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because if you have two ester groups on opposite sides, then reflecting the molecule over a plane (like the plane bisecting the double bond) would result in the same molecule. So, it's achiral. Hence, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so confident. I think I might need to look up the structure of dimethyl fumarate to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of E/Z isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about the molecule being non-superimposable mirror images, leading to different physical properties like optical rotation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, so when you have two ester groups on opposite sides, is there any possibility of the molecule being chiral? No, because each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (ester groups). So, no chiral centers, and no other form of chirality. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but I'm now confused because I've heard that fumaric acid is a chiral molecule. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond. But each carbon in the double bond has two COOH groups. So, each carbon is connected to two COOH groups. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but wait, if that's the case, then both maleic and fumaric acids would be achiral, which is not correct because I know that maleic acid is chiral. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Maleic acid is chiral because each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents (each has one COOH group and one CH2 group, but wait, that's not right). Alternatively, each carbon in maleic acid is attached to two different groups. Wait, no: each carbon in the double bond has two COOH groups and two CH2 groups. No, that's not right. Let me think again.

In maleic acid (cis), the structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH, with both COOH groups on the same side. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOH groups and two H's? No, wait, each carbon is connected to one COOH group and one CH2 group. Wait, no, the structure is:

HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH is succinic acid. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, in the cis configuration. So, each carbon in the double bond has one COOH group and one CH2 group. Wait, no, each carbon is connected to a COOH group and another CH group. Hmm, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has a COOH group and a CH group, but in the cis configuration. So, each carbon has two different substituents (COOH and CH), making each a chiral center. Wait, that can't be because a double bond can't have two substituents on each carbon that are different in such a way. Wait, perhaps each carbon has two COOH groups and two CH2 groups. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond of maleic acid is connected to one COOH group and two H's. No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the actual structure. Maleic acid has the structure HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond. Each of the two middle carbons (in the double bond) is connected to one COOH group and one CH group. So, each carbon is connected to two different groups (COOH and CH), but in a double bond, each carbon has two substituents. Wait, but each carbon is bonded to two substituents (like COOH and another group), making each a possible chiral center. But wait, in a double bond, the substituents are in a fixed arrangement. So, each carbon has two substituents, but in a double bond, the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans). So, in the cis case (maleic acid), each carbon has two different substituents, but they are arranged in a way that makes each carbon a chiral center. Wait, but if each carbon is connected to two different groups and the molecule isn't symmetric, then each would be a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Wait, but in the cis case, each carbon in the double bond would have the same substituents on both sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Hmm, I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because it's symmetric, and move on.

Now, let's go back to the first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with two ester groups at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Biphenyls can exhibit atropisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that prevents free rotation around the central bond. Atropisomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where the different conformations are considered different isomers because the energy barrier to rotation is high enough that the conformations can be isolated. So, for atropisomerism, the molecule must have a sufficiently high barrier to rotation, usually due to bulky substituents that cause steric hindrance when rotated.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' on each ring. The 6 and 6' positions are across from each other (para positions) on each ring. The substituents are ester groups and nitro groups.

So, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no internal plane of symmetry, then it could exhibit atropisomerism, leading to optical isomerism.

Let me visualize the structure. Each ring has an ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. The biphenyl has two such rings connected at position 1 and 1'.

So, the substituents on each ring are in para positions. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the arrangement of substituents on each ring may lead to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't exhibit optical isomerism. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions, which are para to each other. So, each ring has an ester and a nitro group opposite each other. So, when looking at the biphenyl, the two rings are connected at position 1 and 1', and each has substituents opposite each other. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are para. So, the overall structure might be symmetrical. For example, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it would look the same, implying a plane of symmetry. Thus, the molecule would be achiral, and hence, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks symmetry. For example, if the substituents are not aligned in a symmetrical fashion, leading to the molecule being chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to consider that if the substituents on the biphenyl are such that they cause the molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

In the case of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro and an ester group opposite each other. Now, when the two rings are connected, perhaps the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry. But without a clear understanding, it's challenging to determine.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the biphenyl as having substituents arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are at positions that don't mirror each other, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions mirror each other across the center of the molecule, then the molecule is achiral.

Given that the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions, the molecule might have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the presence of two nitro groups and two ester groups at symmetrical positions might make the molecule symmetric, hence achiral. So, perhaps this molecule doesn't show optical isomerism.

Now, putting it all together:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: possibly no optical isomerism.
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.
3. benzophenone: no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.
4. dimethyl fumarate: possibly no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, option B is 3 and 4, which would mean benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate exhibit optical isomerism, which I think they don't. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake with option 4.

Wait, let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), does that create any chirality? Because each carbon in the double bond has two identical ester groups, the molecule is symmetrical. So, it's achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait—could the molecule exhibit E/Z isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the molecule to have a non-superimposable mirror image, which requires a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

So, in that case, none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the possible answers don't include that option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me think again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that can't be because propanoate has three carbons. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the second carbon is CH2. So, substituents: two CH2 groups, OH, and COOCH3. So, two substituents are the same, so no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH. No, that's a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH, which would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, that's possible. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is CH2, with substituents: OH, COOCH3, and two CH2 groups. So, two substituents are the same, so no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH, which would have the second carbon as CH2 connected to OH and COOCH3. But that still doesn't create a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)COO-CH(OH)-CH3. That would mean the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to two CH3 groups, a COOCH3, and an OH. Wait, that would make four substituents: two CH3 groups, a COOCH3, and an OH. So, two substituents are same (CH3), so no chiral center.

Wait, that can't be right because if the substituents are two CH3 groups, then the carbon can't be chiral. So, in that case, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

If I thought that none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again: if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, and the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could be chiral. Wait, but each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (ester groups), so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no chirality.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. For dimethyl fumarate, the plane would be the plane that bisects the double bond, making the two halves mirror images. So, the molecule is achiral.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, based on this, none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But looking at the options, that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let's go back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Another approach: if the biphenyl has substituents that make it impossible to superimpose on its mirror image, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let's imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has an ester group at 2 and a nitro group at 6. Now, 6 is para to 2 on each ring. So, for each ring, the ester is at 2, and the nitro is at 6, which is across from it.

Now, considering the entire molecule, the arrangement could lead to a lack of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions relative to each other create a chiral center in the biphenyl structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then no optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on the left ring are mirrored by those on the right ring, then the molecule is achiral.

In this case, each ring has an ester at 2 and a nitro at 6. So, when looking at the molecule, the substituents on each ring are mirrored. Thus, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. No optical isomerism.

3. No optical isomerism.

4. No optical isomerism.

But this can't be right because the options don't include this possibility.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. But wait, each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups, so each is connected to two identical substituents. So, no chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of the substituents around the double bond, even without chiral centers. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the molecule has a center of chirality, such as in the case of allenes or other structures where chirality arises from the arrangement around a double bond. But in this case, the double bond is between carbons that have identical substituents, so I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Hmm. Now I'm stuck because none of the compounds seem to exhibit optical isomerism, but the options don't include that possibility.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me think again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the second carbon (the one with the OH) would have substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because the second carbon would have four substituents: two CH3 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. So, two substituents are the same (CH3), so the carbon isn't chiral.

But wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH. Then, the second carbon (in the CH2 group) would have substituents: COOCH3, OH, and two CH2 groups. Again, two substituents are the same, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would have the central carbon (second) with substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. No, that can't be right because the central carbon would have four substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. Wait, no, H's aren't substituents; they're hydrogens attached to the carbon. So, the substituents would be CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. But that would make only three substituents, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)COOCH(OH)CH3. So, the second carbon is connected to two CH3 groups, a COOCH3, and an OH. So, substituents are: two CH3, COOCH3, OH. So, two substituents are identical, so the carbon isn't chiral.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Another approach: what if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's achiral. If not, then it's chiral.

But I'm not seeing a plane of symmetry in any of the compounds, except perhaps benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate.

Now, considering that, perhaps the correct answer is that only none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, the arrangement of the substituents could cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Thus, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Another approach: think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If each substituent on one ring has a corresponding substituent on the other ring, then the molecule is symmetrical. But in this case, each ring has ester and nitro groups at 2 and 6. So, if the substituents on each ring are mirrored, the molecule would be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the ester groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, leading to a lack of symmetry.

But without a clear picture, it's challenging to determine.

In summary, based on the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is that compounds 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate (4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So, perhaps the only compound that does is 1 and maybe another.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about each compound again.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: possible atropisomerism. If the substituents prevent free rotation, leading to atropisomers. Atropisomers are a form of stereoisomerism and can exhibit optical isomerism. So, this compound could exhibit optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, so no.

3. benzophenone: no chiral centers, so no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: no, because it's symmetrical.

So, only compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not an option because the options don't have a choice with only 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let's think again: dimethyl fumarate has the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is trans. Does this create any chirality? Because each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (ester groups), the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Now, considering that, the only compound that might exhibit optical isomerism is 1.

But none of the options have only 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the biphenyl in compound 1 doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, based on my analysis, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 4. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: optical isomerism requires a chiral center. So, perhaps only compounds with chiral centers can exhibit it. So, looking again:

1. biphenyl compound: depends on whether it has a chiral center or atropisomerism.

2. No chiral center.

3. No chiral center.

4. No chiral center.

So, only option 1 could have optical isomerism. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. If the ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of the substituents, even without chiral centers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 2 has a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think quickly: which of these compounds have chiral centers?

Only 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, earlier I thought no chiral center, but perhaps I was wrong.

If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the second carbon has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3. Wait, that's two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH, which would have the second carbon as CH2, connected to COOCH3, OH, and two CH2 groups. Again, two substituents the same, so no chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

After a lot of thinking, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because:

1. has atropisomerism,

2. has a chiral center,

4. has some form of chirality.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry like atropisomerism.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with ester groups at positions 2 and 2' and nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' on each ring. Biphenyl systems can exhibit atropisomerism if the substituents prevent free rotation around the central bond, creating non-superimposable mirror images. Given the bulky substituents at positions 2 and 6, the molecule likely lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon (C2) is connected to an OH group, a COOCH₃ group, and two CH₃ groups. Since two of the substituents on C2 are identical (CH₃ groups), this carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (C₆H₅)₂C=O, where two benzene rings are attached to a ketone group. All carbons in the molecule are either sp² hybridized (aromatic carbons or the carbonyl carbon) or part of a symmetric structure. There are no chiral centers, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical ester groups (COOCH₃). Due to this symmetry, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, only **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1)** exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism. None of the other compounds (2, 3, or 4) have the necessary features for optical isomerism.
