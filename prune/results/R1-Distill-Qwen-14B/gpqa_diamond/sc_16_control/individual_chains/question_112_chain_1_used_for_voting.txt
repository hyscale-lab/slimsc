Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> that's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is S_z. So alpha is an electron state, likely a spin-1/2 particle.

The first part asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, so the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Hmm, that's interesting. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal would be (0,0) and the off-diagonal elements would be (hbar/2, hbar/2) in the top right and bottom left, I think.

Wait, the matrix is zero on the diagonal, and hbar/2 elsewhere. So A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. That looks familiar. Oh right, I think that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if you multiply each element by hbar/2, you get exactly A. So this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator A are the eigenstates of sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. Since sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates for A would be the same, because multiplying by a scalar (hbar/2) doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1). So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates. That is, the probability that a measurement of operator A yields hbar/2 and the probability of yielding -hbar/2.

But wait, the state is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then find the coefficients for each. The square of the absolute value of each coefficient will give the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then compute the probabilities.

Another approach is to note that |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should normalize this state to get |alpha>.

Let me compute the normalization. The state is proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, divided by its norm.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because the inner product is the sum of the products of each component's coefficients multiplied by their conjugates.

Wait, the state is a vector in a two-dimensional space with basis |up> and |down>. So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1=2.

Wait, no, more accurately, |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². So (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. The coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1 +i)(1 -i) = 1 +1=2.

Similarly, the second term's coefficient is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to find the probability that a measurement of operator A (which is (hbar/2) sigma_x) yields its eigenvalues, which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value of A. Because the average value of the operator A is needed as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, another approach: the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So when measuring A, the possible outcomes are (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), since sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the average value of A would be (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

So perhaps I can compute that.

But first, perhaps it's easier to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written in terms of |up> and |down> as follows: 

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

Wait no, wait. Let me think about the spin-1/2 particle. The eigenstates of S_x are |+x> and |-x>, which can be expressed as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me double-check.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the eigenstates are the ones where sigma_x |psi> = lambda |psi>.

The eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

The eigenstate for lambda=+1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), so in terms of |up> and |down>, that's |+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, the eigenstate for lambda=-1 is (1,-1)/sqrt(2), so |-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

Then, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is |c1|^2, and the probability of measuring -hbar/2 is |c2|^2.

So let's compute c1 and c2.

We have |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Express |alpha> as c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 [ |up> + |down> ] / sqrt(2) + c2 [ |up> - |down> ] / sqrt(2)

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down> 

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), so we can equate the coefficients:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i) / sqrt(7)
( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

We can write these as two equations:

Equation 1: c1 + c2 = (1 + i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ? Wait, wait no.

Wait, no. Let me reorganize.

Let me multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

Equation 1: c1 + c2 = (1 + i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) = (1 + i) sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: c1 - c2 = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) = (2 - i) sqrt(2/7)

Now, I can solve these two equations for c1 and c2.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= (3) sqrt(2/7)
=> c1 = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation2 from equation1:

2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= (1 +i -2 +i ) sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7)
=> c2 = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3, as I have.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So, c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) / sqrt(7) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

From equation1: c1 + c2 = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it again.

Wait, after multiplying both equations by sqrt(2), the equations become:

Equation1: c1 + c2 = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation2: c1 - c2 = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

So adding equations 1 and 2:

2 c1 = [ (1 + i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
=> c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) 

Similarly, subtracting equation2 from equation1:

2 c2 = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
=> c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2 

So, the coefficients c1 and c2 are:

c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

c2 = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Now, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

(3^2) * ( (sqrt(2))^2 ) / ( (2^2) * (sqrt(7))^2 )

= 9 * 2 / (4 *7)
= 18 / 28
= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.642857.

Similarly, compute |c2|^2:

The coefficient is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 * (2) / (4 *7).

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The coefficient is [ (-1 + 2i) ] * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is ( |(-1 + 2i)|^2 ) * (2) / (4 *7).

|(-1 + 2i)|^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So |c2|^2 = 5 * 2 / (4 *7) = 10/(28)=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.35714.

Wait, but wait, the sum of these two probabilities should be 1, right?

9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that checks out.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.642857 and 0.35714.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36.

That's close to our computed 0.6428 and 0.357, which round to 0.64 and 0.36 when expressed to two decimal places.

But wait, let's compute more accurately.

9/14 is exactly 0.6428571428… So to two decimals, 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 (if rounded up). So option A's first probability is 0.64, second 0.36. So they match.

Now, the average value of the operator A is the sum over the possible outcomes multiplied by their probabilities.

The possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the average <A> = (hbar/2)(9/14) + (-hbar/2)(5/14) )= (hbar/2)(9/14 -5/14 )= (hbar/2)(4/14 )= (hbar/2)(2/7)= (hbar)(1/7 )= hbar/7.

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7.

So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure.

Option C says average is hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 0.408 hbar, but our calculation is hbar/7≈0.142 hbar. So option A's average is correct.

So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the coefficients.

Wait, when I compute |c2|^2, perhaps I made a mistake.

c2 is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is ( [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ) / ( (2^2) (sqrt(7))^2 )

Which is (1 +4) * 2 / (4 *7) )=5 *2/(28)=10/28=5/14.

So yes, that's correct. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So the options that match are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Looking at the options again:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7. Yes.

But wait, let me check if the average is indeed hbar/7.

Yes, because:

Probability of +hbar/2 is 9/14.

Probability of -hbar/2 is 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )= [ (9 -5) / (28) ] hbar = (4/28) hbar = (1/7) hbar.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the correct option is A.

The problem involves a quantum state |α> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, compute the norm squared:
\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \hbar/2 \\ \hbar/2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is equivalent to \((\hbar/2) \sigma_x\), where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\) are the eigenstates of A:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
The eigenvalues of A are \(\hbar/2\) and \(-\hbar/2\), corresponding to \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), respectively.

### Step 3: Express |α> in terms of |+x\rangle and |-x\rangle
Substitute the expressions for \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) into |α>:
\[
|α\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Expanding in terms of \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\):
\[
|α\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
c_1 = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) are \(|c_1|^2\) and \(|c_2|^2\), respectively:
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately:
\[
P(+x) = 0.64, \quad P(-x) = 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of A
The average value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9 - 5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The probabilities are \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), and the average value is \(\hbar/7\). This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
