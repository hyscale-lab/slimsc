Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the options given are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is fundamental. Effective field theories usually respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. Since the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT operators should too. So any operator that doesn't conserve Lorentz symmetry probably wouldn't be part of SMEFT.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. But in effective field theories, I think you can have operators that break translational symmetry because they are non-renormalizable. Or do they? Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies it's also Poincare-invariant because Lorentz and translations together make up Poincare. So if Lorentz symmetry is respected, then Poincare should also be. So both 1 and 2 would be correct?

Wait, but in effective field theories, you can have operators that don't conserve momentum, but because the theory itself is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators are written in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry, which would imply Poincare as well. So if the theory respects Poincare, then operators should respect it.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that in SMEFT, the theory is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So operators must be Lorentz scalars, which are also Poincare scalars because Poincare includes Lorentz. So yes, both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Then what about CP and CPT symmetry? Well, the Standard Model is approximately CP symmetric, but not exactly because of CKM CP violation. So do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? Not necessarily. Because you can have operators that explicitly break CP, such as including terms that violate it. For example, operators with phases that are not part of the CKM matrix could break CP. So SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP, depending on the new physics. So 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. The CPT theorem states that in a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT must be conserved. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT as well. So 4 must be respected.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait the options given: looking at the options, C) is 1,2,4. So that would be correct.

Wait, but I thought that SMEFT is constructed in a way that maintains the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has CPT symmetry, so SMEFT must too. Because any effective theory derived from the Standard Model by adding higher-dimension terms (without introducing non-Lorentz-invariant terms) will respect CPT.

So the correct symmetries that all operators must respect are 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include Lorentz symmetry. Since Lorentz symmetry is fundamental to effective field theories, all SMEFT operators must respect it. Poincaré symmetry, which combines Lorentz symmetry with translational symmetry, is also automatically respected in SMEFT because the theory is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Therefore, both Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

CP symmetry (3), on the other hand, is not necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators. The Standard Model already exhibits CP violation, and SMEFT allows for operators that explicitly break CP symmetry, depending on the nature of the new physics. Thus, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.

CPT symmetry (4), however, must be respected. The CPT theorem ensures that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, such as SMEFT, must conserve CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it also respects CPT symmetry.

In conclusion, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:
