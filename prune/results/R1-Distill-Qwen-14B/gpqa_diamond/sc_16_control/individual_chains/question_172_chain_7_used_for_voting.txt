Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I think that means we can use the Boltzmann distribution for this.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The formula I remember is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, both stars are studying iron atoms, so the statistical weights (g) for the energy levels should be the same for both stars, right? So g_upper and g_lower are the same for star_1 and star_2. That means the ratio of n_upper to n_lower for each star would depend on the exponential term.

The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, the ratio n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 is twice that of star_2. So, let me write that down.

Let me denote n1 = n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2) = 2 * n2.

But wait, n1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and similarly n2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Since (g_upper/g_lower) is the same for both, the ratio n1/n2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute n1 / n2.

n1 = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
n2 = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
n1/n2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

But according to the problem, n1 is twice n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

So,

2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, let's rearrange the terms.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) * k / ΔE

Wait, but the answer options have T1 and T2 terms in various ways. Let me see the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1
Wait, that can't be right because the equation I have is ln(2) = something involving 1/T2 and 1/T1.

Alternatively, maybe I should rearrange the equation I have.

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me factor out the negative sign:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )
= (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, the options are:

A) ln(2) = T2 / T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, according to what I have,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have the (ΔE/(k)) term. Oh wait, perhaps the question assumes that the given energy difference is already substituted, so the equation is written in terms of something else. Or maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the ratio of excitation in stars 1 and 2.

n1 = 2 n2

So, let's write:

(n_upper / n_lower) for star 1 is 2 times that for star 2.

Which gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / g_L1 * g_U1 = 2 [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) / g_L2 * g_U2 ]

Assuming g_U and g_L are same for both stars, since same element and energy levels. So g_U/g_L is same for both.

So the equation simplifies to:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Dividing both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), we get:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same equation as before.

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2 )

But in the options, the only one that has (T1 - T2) in numerator and T1 T2 denominator is option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

But wait, the equation is ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) times [ ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ]

But in the problem statement, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, but the options don't include this term. Hmm. So perhaps the question expects us to have that the expression (ΔE/(k)) is a factor, but in the options, it's not present. So perhaps the correct form is ln(2) = (something) involving T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options don't include any constants, so perhaps the equation is simplified. Alternatively, maybe I should have expressed it in terms of the ratio of temperatures.

Wait, another approach: if we divide the two equations.

Let me write the Boltzmann factor for each star.

n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

For star_1: n1 = A exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2 = A exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

We have n1 = 2 n2.

So,

A exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 A exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by A:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the ratio:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Taking ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2) ) = ln(2) T1 T2

Which can be rearranged to:

(T1 - T2) = [ ln(2) T1 T2 k ] / ΔE

But again, the options don't include these constants. So perhaps the correct form is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1 T2), multiplied by some constants. But the options only have the (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) term, without any constants. So perhaps the given options assume that (ΔE/k) is 1, which is not correct because ΔE is 1e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k) to see.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh wait, that's interesting. Because if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE/k = 1 K.

So, substituting back into our equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) )

But wait, (1 K) is a unit, so when multiplied by (something in 1/K), it gives a dimensionless number.

Wait, no: (1/K) multiplied by K would give unitless.

Wait, the term (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) has units of 1/K.

So, (1 K) multiplied by (1/K) gives a unitless number, which matches ln(2) which is unitless.

So, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct answer should be option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and it is observed that the excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the excitation ratio is related to the temperatures of the stars.

The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through and taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not involve the difference \( T_1 - T_2 \).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it introduces \( T_1 + T_2 \), which is not part of the derived equation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it includes \( (T_1 T_2)^2 \), which is not present in the derived equation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
