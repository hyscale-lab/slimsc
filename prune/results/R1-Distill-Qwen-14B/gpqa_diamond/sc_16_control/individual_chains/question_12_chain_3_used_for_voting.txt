Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think this through.

The question says that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino, which is probably a nu_mu, since the pion is a positive one. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Oh wait, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but I think for these kinds of problems, we usually neglect their rest mass because it's so small compared to the others. So, the neutrino's mass would be treated as zero.

Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the momenta of the products (muon and neutrino) must cancel each other out. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But since the neutrino is almost massless, I think its momentum will be much larger than the muon's. Wait, no, because the muon has a significant rest mass, perhaps it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should approach this with conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion since it's stationary. So the initial energy E_initial is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy E_mu would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, E_nu = K_nu, since its rest mass is zero.

So, conservation of energy gives:
E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu
Which simplifies to:
K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now for conservation of momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So, the vector sum of the muon's and neutrino's momenta is zero. Let me denote the magnitudes: |p_mu| = p, |p_nu| = P. Then, since they are opposite in direction, p = P.

But wait, the neutrino's momentum would be p_nu = E_nu / c, because for massless particles, E = pc. For the muon, its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), so E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (105.7 MeV)^2 c^4 ) / c². Hmm, maybe it's easier to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

So, the momentum of the muon is p, and the neutrino's is P = E_nu (since E=pc for neutrino).

But the momenta are equal in magnitude, so p = P.

So, now I have two equations:

1. K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV
2. p = E_nu

And also, E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me substitute p with E_nu in the second equation.

So,

105.7 + K_mu = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

But from equation 1, E_nu = K_nu, because the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy (since rest mass is zero). Wait, no. Wait, the neutrino's energy is K_nu, but the muon's energy is 105.7 + K_mu. So, let me write E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

So, substituting p = E_nu into the equation for E_mu:

E_mu = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

But E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

And since K_nu is E_nu (because neutrino's energy is all kinetic), because E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The neutrino's energy is K_nu, but E_nu is its kinetic energy plus its rest mass. Wait no, the rest mass is zero, so E_nu = K_nu + m_nu c^2. Since m_nu is zero, E_nu = K_nu.

So, substituting E_nu = K_nu into the equation:

105.7 + K_mu = sqrt( (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

But K_mu + K_nu = 33.9.

So, let me let K_nu = x. Then, K_mu = 33.9 - x.

Substituting into the equation:

105.7 + (33.9 - x) = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute the left side:

105.7 + 33.9 = 139.6. So,

139.6 - x = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + 105.7²

Subtract x² from both sides:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x = 105.7^2

Compute 139.6² and 105.7²:

139.6² = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV²

105.7^2 = (100 + 5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV²

So,

19488.16 - 2*139.6 x = 11172.49

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 x

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's see, 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let me subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49) → 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67 MeV²

So,

8315.67 = 279.2 x → (since 2*139.6 = 279.2)

So, x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Approximately:

279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279 *30=8370, so 279.2 *29.8= 279.2*(30-0.2)=8376 - 55.84= 8320.16. Which is close to 8315.67.

So, 29.8 gives about 8320.16, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So perhaps the exact value is a bit less than 29.8.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

29.8 * 200 = 5960

29.8 *79.2 = ?

Wait, maybe I should compute 279.2 *29.8:

279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 * (30 - 0.2) = 279.2 *30 =8376, minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84=8320.16. So 8320.16 is at x=29.8.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 minus 4.49. So, 279.2 * (29.8 - (4.49/279.2)).

So, 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So, x≈29.8 - 0.016=29.784 → approximately 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, x is K_nu. So, K_nu = x ≈29.78 MeV.

Therefore, K_mu =33.9 - x ≈33.9 -29.78=4.12 MeV.

So, the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. So that matches.

Another way to cross-check: the neutrino's KE is higher because it's massless, so it takes away more momentum. The muon has lower KE because of its larger rest mass. So, that makes sense.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is effectively zero.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
After decay, the energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]  
The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy:  
\[
E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_{\mu}.
\]  
The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic:  
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]  
Thus,  
\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. The muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]  
For the muon, its energy is related to its momentum by:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
For the neutrino, its energy is equal to its momentum (since it is massless):  
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]  
Equating the two momenta:  
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\), we get:  
\[
105.7 + K_{\mu} = \sqrt{K_{\nu}^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  

### Solving for \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\)
Let \(K_{\nu} = x\). Then \(K_{\mu} = 33.9 - x\). Substituting into the equation:  
\[
105.7 + (33.9 - x) = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
Simplify the left side:  
\[
139.6 - x = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
Square both sides:  
\[
(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expand and simplify:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2(139.6)x = 105.7^2.
\]  
Compute \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):  
\[
19488.16 - 2(139.6)x = 11172.49.
\]  
Subtract \(11172.49\) from both sides:  
\[
8315.67 = 279.2x.
\]  
Solve for \(x\):  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Thus, \(K_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(K_{\mu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). This matches option D.
