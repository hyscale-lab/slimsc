Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics and energy calculations. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The given masses are Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c². The options are A to D, each giving two energies which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, wait. I remember that in decay processes, especially when the parent particle is at rest, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Wait, but the muon and the neutrino are the products. Oh, right, in the decay Pi+ → mu+ + nu, the neutrino is a lepton, probably a muon neutrino. Since neutrinos have very tiny (but non-zero) mass, but in many problems, especially at this level, they're treated as massless. But let me double-check. The muon has a rest mass, and if the neutrino is considered massless, that might simplify things.

So, the initial rest mass energy of the Pi+ is 139.6 MeV. That should equal the sum of the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energies. But wait, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible (like maybe a few MeV or less, but in many cases treated as zero). So let's proceed under the assumption that the neutrino is massless.

Wait, but if the neutrino has a rest mass, that would change things. The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to proceed with the neutrino as massless unless told otherwise.

So, the energy of each product after decay would be their rest mass plus kinetic energy. Let me set up the equations.

The initial energy is the rest energy of Pi+ which is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

The final energy is the sum of energies of mu+ and nu. The mu+ has energy E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) and the neutrino's energy E_nu = |p c|, since if it's massless, E = pc.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote the muon's momentum as p in the positive direction, so neutrino's is -p. But since the neutrino's momentum magnitude is p, and muon's is also p. Wait, no, wait. Because the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero. So if the muon's momentum is +p, the neutrino's is -p. But since the neutrino has momentum magnitude p (as in, |p| is the same), but in opposite direction.

Wait, but when considering magnitudes, perhaps it's easier to say that |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. So their magnitudes are equal, directions opposite.

So the muon's energy is sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c² (since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), so E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units can be tricky. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, which is common in particle physics. So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²). Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, since for massless particles, E = p.

So the total energy of the products is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

This should equal the initial energy, which is m_pi. Because the pion is at rest, its energy is its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV.

So setting up the equation:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

We can rearrange this to solve for p.

Let me write it again:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, let me denote m_mu = 105.7 MeV, m_pi = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Then square both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

So,

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi).

Plugging in the numbers:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So,

p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6).

Let me compute numerator first: 139.6² is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute 139.6 * 139.6.

Alternatively, perhaps compute (139.6 -105.7)(139.6 +105.7) = difference * sum.

Wait, 139.6² - 105.7² = (139.6-105.7)(139.6+105.7) = (33.9)(245.3) 

Calculating 33.9 * 245.3.

Let me compute 34 * 245 = 8330, but 33.9 is 0.1 less than 34. So 33.9 * 245.3 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 33.9 * 245.3 = ?

Let me compute 33.9 * 245 = 33.9 * (200 +45) = 33.9*200=6780, 33.9*45= 1525.5 → 6780 +1525.5=8305.5.

Then 33.9 * 0.3 = 10.17. So total is 8305.5 +10.17=8315.67.

So numerator is approx 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 is about 279 *30=8370, so 279*29=8091. So 29 *279.2 = 29 * 279 = 8091, 29*0.2=5.8 → 8096.8.

But 8096.8 is less than 8315.67.

What's 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p is approximately 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. Let me do 8315.67 / 279.2.

Alternatively, 279.2 * 29.78 = ?

Wait, perhaps using calculator-like steps:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 -279.2=8096.8.

Then, 279.2 * 0.78 = let me see, 279.2 *0.7 = 195.44; 279.2 *0.08=22.336 → sum 217.776.

So 29.78 → 29 + 0.78 → 8096.8 + 217.776= 8314.576.

Which is very close to 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8314.576= 1.094.

How much more? 1.094 /279.2 ≈ 0.00392.

So p ≈29.78 + 0.00392 ≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but since we're in units where c is 1, E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

Wait, no, wait. Earlier, when I set c=1, E_nu = p, so yes, 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but let me make sure. The muon’s energy is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) → sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(887.1 + 11172.49) ≈ sqrt(12059.59) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, let me check: 105.7^2 is 105.7 *105.7. 100^2=10,000. 5.7^2=32.49. 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2=1140 + 10000 +32.49=11,172.49.

And p^2 is (29.784)^2: 29^2 is 841, 0.784^2≈0.614, and cross terms 2*29*0.784=45.376. So (29.784)^2≈ (29 +0.784)^2=29² + 2*29*0.784 +0.784² = 841 +45.376 +0.614≈887. So 887 +11,172.49=12,059.49. The square root is sqrt(12059.49)= about 109.81 MeV.

So the muon's energy is 109.81 MeV, and the neutrino's is 29.784 MeV.

The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is same as its energy, since its rest mass is zero (if we're assuming that), so 29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV (mu) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So the answer is D.

Wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculation?

Let me double-check the calculation of p.

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi).

m_pi=139.6, m_mu=105.7.

So m_pi^2 = 139.6^2 = let me compute that precisely.

139.6 *139.6:

Compute 139 *139: (140-1)^2 = 140² - 2*140*1 +1=19600 -280 +1=19321.

Then 139.6 is 139 +0.6, so (139 +0.6)^2 =139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2= 19321 + 166.8 +0.36=19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu^2=105.7^2: Let me compute.

105^2=11,025. 0.7^2=0.49. 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 +0.7)^2=105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2=11025 +147 +0.49=11172.49.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by 2 m_pi: 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me see:

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8 (since 279.2 *30 = 8376 → 8376 - 279.2=8096.8).

So 29 ×279.2 =8096.8.

Subtracting from 8315.67: 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

218.87 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p=29.783 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p=29.783 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )= sqrt( 887.0 + 11172.49 )=sqrt(12059.49)= approx 109.81 MeV.

So K.E. for mu is 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

E_nu is 29.783, so K.E. is same as E_nu, assuming massless.

So the KEs are 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV, which matches option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option is D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process **Pi⁺ → μ⁺ + ν** where the pion (Pi⁺) is initially at rest. The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of Pi⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)  

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before and after the decay must be equal. Initially, the pion is at rest, so its energy is purely its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum:  
   \[
   |\vec{p}_{\mu}| = |\vec{p}_{\nu}| = p.
   \]

### Energy of the Products
The energy of the muon is given by:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4}.
\]
For the neutrino (assumed massless), the energy is:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p c.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
The total energy after the decay is:  
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p c.
\]
Equating this to the initial energy:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p c = m_{\pi} c^2.
\]
Dividing through by \( c^2 \) (using natural units where \( c = 1 \)):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p,
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
- \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \),
- \( m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4 \),
- \( m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4 \),
- \( m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4 \),
- \( p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c \).

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
- \( p^2 = 29.784^2 \approx 887.0 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^2 \),
- \( m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4 \),
- \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV} \).

The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Assuming the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is the same as its energy:  
\[
K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.11 MeV** and **29.78 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options:  
- **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  
This matches the calculated values.

**Answer: D**
