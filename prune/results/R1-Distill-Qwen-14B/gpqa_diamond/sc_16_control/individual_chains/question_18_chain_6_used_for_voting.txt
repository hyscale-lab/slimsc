Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I guess the mass part isn't super relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances, which depend more on chemical composition than mass, right? Or maybe not. Hmm, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe I can focus on the abundance data given.

The given abundances are in terms of [X/Y], which I remember are logarithmic scales. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of element X to element Y, relative to the Sun. Oh wait, no, more precisely, it's the logarithm of the ratio of X abundance relative to Y compared to the solar ratio. So [X/Y] = log10 (n_X/n_Y) - log10 (n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log10 (n_X/n_Y in star / n_X/n_Y in Sun) ).

Let me try to jot down the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
and
12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. For the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) equals 7.5. So taking 12 + log10(...) = 7.5 means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH in the Sun is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, let me calculate that. For the Sun:

nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → because log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Now, the question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2) = ?

But wait, I don't have the [Si/Fe] for Star_2 or [Mg/Si] for Star_1. Wait, no, let me look again. Star_1 has [Si/Fe] = 0.3, and Star_2 has [Mg/Si] =0.3. So I'll need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio.

Let me think step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which means log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3 ?

Wait, no. The general formula is [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_{star} / (n_X / n_Y)_{sun} )

So [X/Y] = log( (n_X/n_Y)_{star} ) - log( (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

So for Star_1:

log(n_Si/n_Fe)_{star1} - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3

We know that [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H)_{star1} - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0 → log(n_Fe/n_H in star1) = same as Sun → which means n_Fe/n_H in Star1 is same as in Sun.

Wait, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Star1's Fe abundance is solar. So n_Fe in Star1 is same as in Sun relative to H.

So, in Star1:

n_Fe/n_H = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So, let's denote:

n_X = number density of element X.

n_X / n_Y = ratio in the star.

For Star1:

log(n_Si/n_Fe)_{star1} = 0.3 + log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So, n_Si/n_Fe in Star1 is 10^(0.3) * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe in Star1) - log(n_Si/n_Fe in Sun) ) = 0.3.

So, log( (n_Si/n_Fe)_{star1} ) = 0.3 + log( (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun )

Thus, (n_Si/n_Fe)_{star1} = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But in Star1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so n_Fe/n_H = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So, n_Fe in Star1 is same as Sun's.

Let me compute (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

From the Sun's data, n_Fe/n_H = 3.16e-5. And n_Si is given indirectly. Wait, no, the Sun's data only gives n_Fe/n_H and n_Mg/n_H. Oh, wait, I don't have n_Si/n_H for the Sun. Hmm. So how can I find (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun?

Wait, maybe I can express this in terms of n_Si/n_H.

Because in the Sun, n_Si is another element. Since I don't have its abundance, perhaps I can use the Mg/Si ratio.

Wait, but for Star_2, I have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si in Star1 and Star2 in terms of H, then find the ratio.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, for Star1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so n_Fe/n_H in Star1 is same as Sun. Let me denote as n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) ? Or wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to think in terms of logarithm.

Wait, [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0. So, log10(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun → so n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But wait, how is the number density scaling? Let's think in terms of number densities. The total number of particles is n = n_H + n_He + n_metals. But perhaps, in the photosphere, H is the dominant species, so n_H ≈ n. But might not matter as we'll take ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that n_X / n_Y in star is (n_X / n_Y)_sun multiplied by 10^[X/Y].

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express each element's abundance relative to H, as [X/H], then find the ratios.

Let me outline what I know:

For the Sun:

log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = -4.5 → so n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5) ≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun = -5 → n_Mg/n_H = 1e-5.

But what about n_Si/n_H in the Sun? Hmm, I don't have it. Wait, perhaps I can get it via the Mg/Si ratio in the Sun? Or do I need to find it another way.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si/n_H in the Sun by using the Mg/Si ratio in Star_2, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the Si abundance in terms of the Fe and Mg abundances.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the problem in terms of [X/H] for each star, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again.

We need to find n_Si1 / n_Si2.

So, what's n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of solar?

Let me try to find [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

So, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 10^(-4.5).

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log( (n_Si/n_Fe)1 ) - log( (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) ) = 0.3.

So, (n_Si/n_Fe)1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Thus, n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

Wait, but n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 * n_H1.

Similarly, (n_Si/n_H)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_H1/n_H_sun) ?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express [Si/H] for Star_1.

Because [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun.

So, let's compute [Si/H]_1.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 =0.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So, (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) = 0.3.

So, (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Thus, n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

So, substituting:

n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

But (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = (n_Si/n_H)_sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So, n_Si1 = [ (n_Si/n_H)_sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_sun ) ] * 10^0.3 * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

Simplify:

n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_sun ) * n_H1.

Wait, that would be:

n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 * n_H1.

Because (n_Fe/n_H)_sun cancels out.

Wait, so n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 * n_H1.

Similarly, [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1) - log(n_Si/n_H)_sun.

Substituting n_Si1 = n_Si_sun * 10^{0.3} ... Wait, perhaps I should compute [Si/H]_1.

Because [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1 / n_H1) - log(n_Si/n_H)_sun.

From above, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3.

So,

log(n_Si1/n_H1) = log( (n_Si/n_H)_sun * 10^0.3 )

= log( (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) + 0.3.

So,

[Si/H]_1 = [ log( (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) + 0.3 ] - log( (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3? Because the logarithm terms cancel, and you're left with 0.3.

Wait, that can't be right because [Fe/H] is 0, but I'm getting [Si/H] =0.3. So that would mean that Star_1 has 10^0.3 times more Si relative to H than the Sun. So n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

But wait, I don't know (n_Si/n_H)_sun. Hmm. Because the Sun's data only gives n_Fe/n_H and n_Mg/n_H. So I can't compute [Si/H]_1 directly unless I can relate Si to another element whose solar abundance I know.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me consider the given options and see if there's a way to find the ratio without knowing the Sun's Si abundance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of Si in Star1 to Si in Star2 is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2 / n_Si2) ) * (n_Si2 / n_H2) ?

Wait, no, that's more complicated. Maybe it's better to express each star's [Si/H], then compute the ratio.

Wait, for Star2, given [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

So, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * n_H2.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 / (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun ) )=0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun * 10^0.3.

Thus, n_Si2 = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun * 10^{-0.3} * n_Mg2.

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * n_H2.

So, n_Si2 = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun * 10^{-0.3} * (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * n_H2.

Which simplifies to:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg)_sun / n_Si_sun ) * 10^{-0.3} * (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * n_H2.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't know (n_Si/n_H)_sun. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let me assign some variables.

Let me denote:

For the Sun:

a = n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5) ≈3.16e-5.

b = n_Mg/n_H =1e-5.

c = n_Si/n_H (unknown).

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of [X/H].

Wait, but perhaps I can compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3 * (n_Fe1/n_H1) )

But n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )

= (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *10^0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si1/n_H1) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

= log10( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)*10^0.3 ) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)

= 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → which means Star_1 has 10^0.3 times more Si relative to H than the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → (n_Mg2/n_H2) = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun).

So, n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun * n_H2.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2 / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun *10^0.3 )) )

= ( (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun *n_H2 ) ) / ( (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^0.3 )

= (n_Mg_sun *n_H2 ) / (n_H_sun * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^0.3 )

= (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2 * (1 /10^0.3 )

So,

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * (1/10^0.3 )

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si2/n_H2) ) - log10( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

= log10( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)*10^(-0.3) ) - log10( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

= log10( n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) -0.3 - log10( n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

= -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → Star_2 has 10^-0.3 times the Si abundance relative to H compared to the Sun.

Wait, that makes sense. So now, we have the [Si/H] for both stars.

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So the ratio is n_Si1 / n_Si2.

But n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * n_H1.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2.

So the ratio is:

(n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1) / ( (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2 )

= ( (10^0.3 * c ) * n_H1 ) / ( (10^-0.3 * c ) * n_H2 ), where c = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So, the c terms cancel out.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (10^0.3 * n_H1) / (10^-0.3 * n_H2 )

= (10^0.3 / 10^-0.3) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

Now, what is n_H1 and n_H2? Are they the same? Or do they vary?

Wait, that's a good point. The problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, for each star, the total number density of H (n_H) might be different.

But wait, without knowing the overall metallicity or any other parameters, I can't find n_H1 and n_H2. Unless... Oh, perhaps the problem assumes that the number densities are normalized such that H is the same in both stars? Or perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1? Or maybe not.

Wait, that can't be right. The ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 would depend on the ratio of H in each star, which we don't have information about. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars, i.e., [H]_1 = [H]_2 =0. But wait, the given data doesn't state that. Wait, the [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is solar. But [Fe/H] is a measure of the metallicity. If [Fe/H] is 0, the star's Fe abundance is solar, but the overall H abundance could vary based on the star's overall properties. But wait, in this case, perhaps the H number density is the same in both stars? Or perhaps it's not given, so we have to proceed without it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the H number density is the same in both stars, but that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the H number density cancels out because we can express the ratio in terms of [Si/H], which is given.

Wait, but in the expression for n_Si1/n_Si2, we have (n_H1/n_H2). Without knowing how n_H1 and n_H2 relate, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the overall number of H atoms is the same in both stars. Or perhaps it doesn't matter because the ratio of n_Si1/n_Si2 is determined only by [Si/H] in each star.

Wait, but in our earlier step, the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) = 10^0.6 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

So, unless n_H1/n_H2 is 1, I can't compute the ratio without more info. So perhaps I'm missing a step where n_H1 and n_H2 can be related.

Wait, but perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] can help us. Let me think.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → as earlier.

For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of H in the two stars. So perhaps I can find it by using another element.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2 by considering another element, say, Fe and Mg.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the following approach: the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 can be expressed as (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_H2) * (n_H2/n_Si2).

But that's not helpful. Alternatively, from the earlier expressions, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^(0.6) * (n_H1/n_H2).

But I can't find (n_H1/n_H2) without more data.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the H abundance is the same in both stars, so n_H1 = n_H2. But that's an assumption, and it's not stated in the question. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find n_H1/n_H2 using another element's abundance.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, which means n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But I don't know how n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun relate to each other or to anything else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Sun's n_Fe and n_Mg are known, but I don't think that's directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the ratio of silicon atoms is n_Si1 / n_Si2. From earlier, this is 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 ).

But I don't have (n_H1/n_H2 ). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that both stars have the same H number density, meaning n_H1 = n_H2. So, (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = 10^{0.6}.

Wait, 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is approximately 4.0. So the ratio would be ~4.0.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that's a possible answer.

But why would the problem assume that n_H is the same in both stars? Because the question doesn't state that. Oh, but perhaps in the photospheres, H is dominant, so the number of H atoms could be considered the same, or perhaps it's a normalization assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of H cancels out. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, another approach using the relative abundances without considering the H ratio.

We have:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_Si2/n_Si2) → no, perhaps not.

Wait, n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) ) * (n_Si2/n_Si2) → no, that's not correct.

Alternatively,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= (10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) / (10^-0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= (10^{0.6}) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Hmm, same as before.

So, the ratio depends on (n_H2/n_H1 )= (n_H1/n_H2 )^{-1}.

But without knowing (n_H1/n_H2 ), I can't calculate it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that (n_H1/n_H2 ) =1, making the ratio 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (n_H1/n_H2 ) using another element.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But I don't know how n_Fe1 and n_Mg2 relate to each other.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 = (n_Fe1 * n_H_sun ) / (n_Fe_sun * n_H2 )

Because from Star_1: n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, Star_2: n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2.

But I don't think that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0, the metallicity (abundance of elements relative to H) is solar for Fe in Star_1 and Mg in Star_2.

But I'm stuck on the fact that I can't find the H ratio without more data.

Wait, maybe I can assume that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars. So, n_H1 =n_H2.

In that case, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is close to option A, ~3.9.

But is that a valid assumption? The problem doesn't specify anything about H in the stars, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the overall metallicity (sum of all elements) is the same, but that's not stated either.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is using the fact that the ratio of Si in the two stars is the product of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the ratio without considering the H terms, leading to a ratio of 10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3} }=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So, given the options, the answer would be option A, ~3.9.

I think that's the way to go, even though I'm not entirely certain about the assumption about n_H.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance scale [X/Y] = log10((n_X/n_Y)_{star} / (n_X/n_Y)_{sun}).

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0
   - [Fe/H] = 0 implies (n_Fe/n_H)_{Star_1} = (n_Fe/n_H)_{Sun}.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0
   - [Mg/H] = 0 implies (n_Mg/n_H)_{Star_2} = (n_Mg/n_H)_{Sun}.

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 → log10(n_Fe/n_H)_{Sun} = -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H = 10^{-4.5}.
   - 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H) = 7 → log10(n_Mg/n_H)_{Sun} = -5 → n_Mg/n_H = 10^{-5}.

### Step 1: [Si/H] for Star_1
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{Si}/n_{Fe})_{Star_1} = \log_{10}(n_{Si}/n_{Fe})_{Sun} + 0.3.
\]
Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, (n_Fe/n_H)_{Star_1} = (n_Fe/n_H)_{Sun}. Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Star_1} = \frac{n_{Si}}{n_{Fe}}_{Star_1} \cdot \frac{n_{Fe}}{n_{H}}_{Star_1} = \left(\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{Fe}}_{Sun} \cdot 10^{0.3}\right) \cdot \frac{n_{Fe}}{n_{H}}_{Sun}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Star_1} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Sun}.
\]
Thus, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

### Step 2: [Si/H] for Star_2
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_{Si})_{Star_2} = \log_{10}(n_{Mg}/n_{Si})_{Sun} + 0.3.
\]
Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, (n_Mg/n_H)_{Star_2} = (n_Mg/n_H)_{Sun}. Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Star_2} = \frac{n_{Si}}{n_{Mg}}_{Star_2} \cdot \frac{n_{Mg}}{n_{H}}_{Star_2} = \left(\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{Mg}}_{Sun} \cdot 10^{-0.3}\right) \cdot \frac{n_{Mg}}{n_{H}}_{Sun}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Star_2} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Sun}.
\]
Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Star_1}\right) \cdot n_{H1}}{\left(\frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Star_2}\right) \cdot n_{H2}}.
\]
Substituting:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{\left(10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Sun}\right) \cdot n_{H1}}{\left(10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Si}}{n_{H}}_{Sun}\right) \cdot n_{H2}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{H1}}{n_{H2}}.
\]

### Step 4: Assumption for n_H1/n_H2
The problem does not provide explicit information about the relative number densities of hydrogen in the two stars. However, to proceed, we assume that the hydrogen number density is the same in both stars, i.e., \(n_{H1} = n_{H2}\). This simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
