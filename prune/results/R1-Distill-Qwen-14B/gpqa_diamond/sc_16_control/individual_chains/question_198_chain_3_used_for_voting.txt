Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The given data includes the concentration of Co(II) ions, the concentration of thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants for each complex up to the fourth one.

Wait, stability constants, right. Those β values represent the equilibrium constants for the formation of each complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2- where n starts at 1 and goes up to 4. Each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, the solution is pretty concentrated in SCN- compared to Co(II). That might mean that higher complexes are more prevalent, but I'm not sure yet.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)2^2- complex. So that's the n=2 case. So I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]²-.

To find this, I think I need to calculate the concentrations of all possible cobalt complexes and then find the fraction that's the dithiocyanato one.

I remember that the fraction of each species in a series of complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The formula probably involves a kind of partition function where each complex's concentration is weighted by its formation constant and the ligand concentrations.

So the general approach would be:

1. For each complex [Co(SCN)]^n, calculate the concentration using the formation constant βn and the ligand concentrations.

2. Sum all these concentrations to get the total cobalt concentration, then find the fraction of the desired complex.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration includes all these complexes plus the free Co²+ ions. Hmm, but in this case, since the concentrations are given, maybe the solution is such that Co²+ is negligible because SCN- is in excess. Or perhaps I should account for all possible species.

Let me think. The possible species are:

Co²+ (free ion)
[Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
[Co(SCN)₂]²- (n=2, blue)
[Co(SCN)₃]^3- (n=3)
[Co(SCN)₄]^4- (n=4)

So I need to calculate [Co²+], [CoSCN+], [Co(SCN)₂²-], [Co(SCN)₃³-], [Co(SCN)₄⁴-], and then find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)₂²-].

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these, so:

c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂²-] + [Co(SCN)₃³-] + [Co(SCN)₄⁴-]

But how do I compute each term?

I think each complex's concentration can be expressed using the formation constants and the ligand concentrations. For each formation step, adding a ligand.

Wait, the formation constants are given as β1, β2, etc. So for each complex:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n

Wait, no. Wait, βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So for each step, the formation is sequential.

Wait, more accurately, the nth complex is formed by adding n SCN- ions to Co²+. The overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is βn, so [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, is that right? Let me think about the general formula. The stability constant (βn) is defined as:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^n)

So rearranged, [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Yes, that's correct. So all the complexes can be written in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN^-]^n.

So, for each n, [complex_n] = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Then, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co²+.

But wait, the total cobalt is the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co²+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)} ]

So substituting each [Co(SCN)_n] as βn [Co²+][SCN]^n.

So,

c_total = [Co²+] + [Co²+][SCN^-] (β1) + [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 (β2) + [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 (β3) + [Co²+][SCN^-]^4 (β4)

Factor out [Co²+]:

c_total = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

We can solve for [Co²+] because we know c_total (which is 1e-2 M) and [SCN^-] (0.1 M).

Let me plug in the numbers. [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1

Term1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: β2 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

Term3: β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

Term4: β4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

So sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9

+0.4=2.3

+0.063=2.363

+0.0016=2.3646

So the denominator (the sum) is approximately 2.3646.

So,

c_total = [Co²+] * 2.3646 → [Co²+] = c_total / 2.3646.

c_total is given as 0.01 M.

So [Co²+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004226 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that correctly.

0.01 divided by approximately 2.3646. Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.004226:

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.004226 ≈ 0.01, correct.

So, [Co²+] ≈ 0.004226 M.

Now, I need to find the concentration of each complex. Let's compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=1:

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN]^1 =9 * 0.004226 *0.1

Compute 9 *0.004226=0.038034, then multiply by 0.1 → 0.0038034 M.

n=2:

[Co(SCN)_2²-] = β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2 =40 *0.004226 * (0.1)^2

0.1^2 is 0.01.

So 40 *0.004226=0.16904. Multiply by 0.01 → 0.0016904 M.

n=3:

β3=63. 63 *0.004226=0.266298. Multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001 → 0.000266298 M.

n=4:

β4=16 →16 *0.004226=0.067616. Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 0.0000067616 M.

Wait, but let me calculate all of these accurately.

n=1:

9 * 0.004226 = 0.038034 → 0.038034 * 0.1 = 0.0038034 M.

n=2:

40 *0.004226 = 0.16904 → 0.16904 *0.01=0.0016904 M.

n=3:

63 *0.004226 = let's compute 0.004226 *60=0.25356, 0.004226 *3=0.012678 → total 0.266238. Multiply by 0.001 → 0.000266238 M.

n=4:

16 *0.004226=0.067616 → multiply by 0.0001 → 0.0000067616 M.

So, each complex's concentration is as above.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's 0.0016904 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so the percentage is:

( [Co(SCN)_2²-] / c_total ) *100 → (0.0016904 / 0.01) *100 = 16.904%.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that. Oh wait, no, wait! Because the c_total is the sum of all species, which is 0.01 M as given. So the [Co(SCN)_2²-] is 0.0016904 M, which is 16.904% of 0.01.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 42.3%
B)25.6%
C)38.1%
D)16.9%

So 16.9% is option D. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check because I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck all steps.

Wait, when I calculated [Co²+], I have [Co²+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004226 M. That part seems correct.

Then, for n=2, the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2-:

[Co(SCN)_2²-] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 =40 *0.004226 * (0.1)^2.

Yes, 0.1 squared is 0.01.

So 40 *0.004226 = 0.16904.

0.16904 * 0.01=0.0016904 M.

So the fraction is (0.0016904 / 0.01) *100 =16.904%, which rounds to 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, the answer options include 16.9% as option D. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the higher complexes might have higher concentrations, but perhaps the βn's don't make it so.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of the sum in the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is 1 + β1*0.1 + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4.

So:

β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

β2 * [SCN]^2=40 *0.01=0.4

β3 * [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063

β4 * [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes, correct. So denominator is 2.3646.

So [Co²+] =0.01 / 2.3646≈0.004226 M.

Then each complex's concentration:

n=1:9 *0.004226 *0.1= 0.0038034 M.

n=2:40*0.004226 *0.01=0.0016904 M.

n=3:63*0.004226 *0.001=0.0002662 M.

n=4:16*0.004226 *0.0001=0.00000676 M.

So the [Co(SCN)_2]²- is 0.0016904 M, which is 16.9% of 0.01 M.

So the answer should be D)16.9%.

Wait, but looking at other options, option C is 38.1%, which is close to 40% which is the second β. Maybe I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait another approach: perhaps the denominator is calculated differently. Or perhaps I should consider that the sum is [Co²+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + ... )

Yes, and that's exactly what I did. So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as a different n. Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato", which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2-.

So yes, n=2, which is 0.0016904 M, which is 16.9% of the total.

So the answer must be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²-, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The concentration of each cobalt complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2−n), is given by:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-n} = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]  
   where βₙ is the stability constant for the nth complex.

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \sum_{n=1}^4 [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-n}
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each complex:  
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
   \]  
   Solving for \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\):  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Denominator**:  
   Using β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16, and [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 M:  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004226 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Concentrations of Complexes**:  
   For each complex, substitute \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\) and [\text{SCN}^-] into the formula:  
   - For n = 1:  
     \[
     [\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038034 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - For n = 2:  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2-} = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot 0.1^2 = 0.0016904 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - For n = 3:  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^{3-} = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot 0.1^3 = 0.0002662 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - For n = 4:  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{4-} = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot 0.1^4 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}
     \]

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²-**:  
   The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2-}}{c_{\text{total}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.0016904}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**.  
**Answer: D**
