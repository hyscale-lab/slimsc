Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds to get specific products. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, no, each reaction gives one of them. Let me read the details.

So reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+, and when the starting material A is treated, it gives (R)-4-ethyl... something. Reaction B uses BH3 and H+, and gives (S)-4-ethyl... same compound. The options are about what starting materials A and B are. The options have different configurations for these starting materials.

Hmm. I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they might have different reducing powers or maybe different reaction conditions. Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, I think BH3 is usually used in a different context. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but maybe in some cases it's used for reduction too?

Wait, wait. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That sounds like a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Oh wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, specifically a gamma-pyrone. So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with O at position 1, ketone at 2, then positions 3,4,5,6. And the substituents are ethyl at 4. The configuration is R or S.

Wait, so how do we get such a compound from a starting material? Probably through a reduction of a carbonyl group. But wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. But wait, in some cases, like with epoxides, maybe it does something else. Hmm, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester or something... Wait, the starting materials are given as options, all are pentanoic acids with ethyl and isobutoxy groups.

Looking at the options, all options have starting materials as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with either R or S configurations. So the structure is a pentanoic acid, with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl), 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an oxo group (a ketone) at C5 and an isobutoxy group at C5 as well. Oh wait, no, position 5 can't have both oxo and isobutoxy. Wait, 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would mean that the same carbon has both an isobutoxy group and an oxo group. That's impossible, unless the oxo is a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, perhaps it's a keto group, so the structure is:

CH2CH2C(=O)OCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like:

The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2)COOH? Or wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would have the structure: 

The pentanoic acid chain is COOH-CH2-CH(X)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but wait, wait: the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-COOH? Wait, no, wait the correct structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, right? So, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid is five carbons, but the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Let's number from the COOH end as position 1. So position 1 is COOH, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is CH2 (but with an ethyl group?), or wait:

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no: it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

1: COOH

2: CH2-

3: CH2-

4: CH2-

5: CH3

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write it properly. The full name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid chain has 5 carbons, with COOH on C1. So:

C1: COOH

C2: CH2-

C3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (wait, ethyl is CH2CH3). So at C3, it's CH(CH2CH3).

C4: ?

Wait, no, the substituents are at 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Wait, in the name, 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo. So position 5 has both an isobutoxy group and an oxo group. So that would be a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So, the structure would be:

At C5: O=C-O-isobutyl?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because O=C-O would be an ester group. Wait, wait, 5-oxo would be a ketone, so C5 is a carbonyl group. But how can C5 also have an isobutoxy group? That would mean that the same carbon has both a carbonyl (O) and an OCH(CH2CH3)2 group. That's impossible because a carbon can't have two oxygen atoms bonded to it as substituents and be part of a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3) - CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2) (C4) - CO (C5)?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So:

Positions:

C1: COOH

C2: CH2

C3: CH(CH2CH3) [since it's 3-ethyl]

C4: ?

C5: O=C-O-isobutyl? No, that would mean that C5 is a carbonyl attached to an oxygen, which is attached to isobutyl. So the structure would be:

C5 is a carbonyl group (it's a ketone), and also has an isobutoxy group. But that's not possible because a single carbon can't have both a carbonyl and another substituent unless it's something like a geminal di-substitution, which is unlikely here. So perhaps the structure is that the oxo is on C5, and the isobutoxy is on C5 as well. Hmm, maybe it's a lactone? No, because the starting material is a pentanoic acid, so it has a COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CO? But that can't be right because it's pentanoic acid, so the chain is five carbons, and the last carbon (C5) is where the COOH is, but in this case, the substituents would be on C3 and C5.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reactions instead. The products are cyclic ketones, so perhaps the starting material undergoes a ring-forming reaction during reduction.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with O at position 1, ketone at 2, and substituents. So, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketone, which upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that.

Wait, but the starting material is given as a pentanoic acid derivative. Hmm, maybe it's an ester? Because the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the ester group is involved in forming the ring.

Wait, let's think about the reactions. Reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+, and the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction B uses BH3 and H+, and the product is (S)-4-ethyl... same compound.

Wait, so the same product is formed, but with opposite configurations. That suggests that the reactions are leading to either retention or inversion of configuration, or perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reducing agents are causing different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different. Oh wait, wait. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but in the presence of certain conditions, it can also be used for reductions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce esters, but in some cases, BH3 might not. Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol, perhaps leading to ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. But the starting material is a pentanoic acid, so when it forms a lactone, it would be a five-membered ring. But the product is a six-membered ring, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but no, the options are all pentanoic acid derivatives. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen or Aldol condensation. But that's not involving LiBH4 or BH3. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has an ester and a carbonyl group that can undergo some kind of cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, okay, let me think about the product. The product is a six-membered ring with an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring has O at 1, ketone at 2, and substituents. So perhaps the ring forms by connecting the carbonyl group in the starting material to another position.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyl, so the ethyl is attached to carbon 4 of the pyran ring. The starting material has an ethyl group at position 3, so maybe during the reaction, the ethyl moves or the ring forms in a way that the substituents end up at position 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketone that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester or a cyclic carbonate or something else. Wait, the starting materials are pentanoic acids, so perhaps they form lactones. So a pentanoic acid can form a five-membered lactone. But the product is a six-membered ring. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, like an ethyl ester, which upon reduction forms an alcohol, and then under certain conditions, undergoes cyclization.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', LiBH4 would reduce it to R-O-CH2-OH or something? Wait, no, LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' is reduced to RCH2OR', perhaps? Or wait, no, I think esters are reduced to glycols, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Because if you have a beta-keto ester, like ethyl acetoacetate, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction leads to a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal or lactone.

Wait, for example, if you have a beta-keto ester like ethyl 3-oxopentanoate, upon reduction, you might get a diol, which could cyclize to form a ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact reaction. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The products are R and S configurations, so the starting materials must have had certain configurations that influenced the product's stereochemistry.

Wait, when you reduce a carbonyl group to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the reducing agent and the reaction conditions. For example, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions where the boron adds to the less substituted side, following anti-Markovnikov addition. LiBH4, on the other hand, is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, but in this case, maybe it's reducing a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product here is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then loses water to form the cyclic ketone. Hmm, that seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to form an alcohol, followed by cyclization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with substituents, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, it opens up or rearranges.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mechanism. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, so it can reduce esters. BH3, perhaps in a different solvent or with a different catalyst, could also reduce certain groups, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, and the reducing agents are reducing different functional groups. For example, LiBH4 might reduce the ester to an alcohol, while BH3 might reduce the ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them, but that doesn't fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think about the product again. It's (R) or (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure of this compound would have the ring oxygen at position 1, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is six-membered, with substituents at 2 and 4 positions.

Now, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure is a five-carbon chain with COOH at the end, an ethyl group at C3, and at C5, both an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo group). Wait, but how can a carbon have both a ketone and an isobutoxy group? That would require the carbon to have two oxygens attached, which isn't possible unless it's a geminal di-substitution, which is not feasible in this case. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let me think: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would have the structure where the COOH is at the end (C1), C3 has an ethyl group, and C5 has both an isobutoxy and a ketone group. But that's not possible, so perhaps there's a typo, and it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid with a ketone at C5.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3) - CO-OCH(CH2CH3)2 (C4?) No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The starting material is a pentanoic acid with an ester group at C5. So, O=C-O-isobutyl group at C5. But then where is the oxo group? Oh, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, that would be 3-oxo-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid, but the option says 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo. So the oxo is on the same carbon as isobutoxy.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to think differently. The product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, leading to a cyclic structure.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like CH2(COOR)COOR', then upon reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2OH group, and the ester becomes CH2OH as well. Then, perhaps the two OH groups can form a ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the ring forms via elimination, leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group, and the reduction leads to ring opening and formation of a diol, which then cyclizes.

Another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which is formed from a diol and a carbonyl group. So maybe the starting material, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, if the starting material has both a carbonyl and an ester group, then upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the carbonyl is also reduced to an alcohol. Then, two alcohol groups are present, which could undergo cyclization by eliminating a water molecule to form a ring with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. For example, if the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CO-O-R

Upon reduction with LiBH4, which reduces esters to glycols, but wait, LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols. Wait, no, LiBH4 doesn't reduce esters to glycols; that's more like acid catalyzed. LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols: RCOOR' → RCH2OR' + other products.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the stereochemistry of the reduction. The product's configuration (R or S) depends on the reducing agent and the starting material's configuration.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can cause certain stereochemical outcomes, while BH3 might do something else. But I'm not too sure about the specifics.

Wait, in the problem, when starting material A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it gives (R)-4-ethyl... and starting material B with BH3 and H+ gives (S)-4-ethyl....

So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reducing agents cause the product to form with opposite configurations.

Wait, but the options for A and B are either same or different in their configurations. For example, option D has A as R and B as S.

So, if the starting material A is R and B is S, then perhaps when reduced with different agents, the products have opposite configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to inversion of configuration, so if the starting material is R, then the product is S, or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stereochemistry involved in the reduction. Let me think about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. For example, when a ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the mechanism.

In the case of a cyclic ketone, the reduction would form a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction isn't of a ketone but of an ester to form an alcohol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, maybe the product is formed through a Claisen condensation. For example, a beta-keto ester undergoing cyclization to form a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction, the ester is converted to a hydroxyl group, allowing for cyclization. For example, reducing the ester to an alcohol and the ketone to another alcohol, leading to a diol that can cyclize into a ring.

Wait, for instance, if the starting material is:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-O-R

Upon reduction, the ester becomes CH2-OH, and the ketone becomes CHOH. Then, the two OH groups can lose a water molecule to form a ring, leading to a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but after reduction, the ketone would become an alcohol, not a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent, and the reduction leads to ring opening and formation of an alcohol, which then can form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a hemiacetal formation. The diol would form a hemiacetal with a ketone, but I'm not clear on the exact steps.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diethyl acetal, and upon hydrolysis and reduction, it forms the cyclic product.

This is getting a bit too vague. Let me try to approach it from the options given.

Looking at the options, A and B are either same or different configurations.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

The reactions use different reagents, LiBH4 and BH3. So perhaps the reaction conditions influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, when using a chiral reducing agent, the product's configuration can be influenced. But I think in this case, the starting material's configuration is more important.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center, and the reduction leads to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is (R), and the reduction leads to (R) product, then perhaps when using a different reagent, the configuration changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the product's configuration based on the reaction's stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact process. Maybe I should think about the possible reactions leading to the product.

Another angle: The product is a pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone. The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an ethyl and isobutoxy group.

Wait, when the starting material (a beta-keto ester) is reduced, perhaps the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is converted to another alcohol. Then, the two hydroxyl groups can lose a water molecule to form a ring, resulting in a cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think of the specific product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, in the ring, position 2 is a ketone, and position 4 is an ethyl group.

If the starting material is a beta-keto ester, say:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-O-R

Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester (O-R) is reduced to CH2-OH, and the ketone (C=O) is reduced to CH-OH.

So, after reduction, we'd have:

COOH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH

Then, perhaps this diol undergoes cyclization by eliminating water between the two OH groups, leading to the formation of a ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. So maybe the elimination forms a double bond, but that wouldn't directly form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the two OH groups lose a water molecule, forming a ring with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethyl group. Upon reduction, the lactone opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not a diol.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again. The options for A and B are either same or different. The product configurations are R and S, which are mirror images.

If the starting materials are enantiomers, then the products would also be enantiomers. So, if A is R, and B is S, then using different reagents would produce (R) and (S) products.

Wait, but if the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reactions are the same, would the products be enantiomers? Or would the configuration depend on the reducing agent?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the stereochemistry of the product. For example, LiBH4 may cause a certain configuration, and BH3 another.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Let me try to find a pattern in the options. The options are A, B, C, D. Each option assigns either (R) or (S) configurations to starting materials A and B.

The product A is (R), and product B is (S). So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the product configurations to be opposite.

Wait, but then why would the reagents cause opposite configurations? Maybe because one reagent is more selective in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the product's configuration, and the reagents don't change that.

Wait, but I don't know. Let's think about the possible reaction mechanism again.

If the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-O-R

Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to CH2-OH, and the ketone to CH2-OH as well. Wait, no, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol, but the ketone would also be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, after reduction, we have:

COOH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH

Now, this is a diol. Then, perhaps the two OH groups undergo cyclization, eliminating a water molecule to form a ring. The elimination would form a double bond, but that's not leading to a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the diol undergoes oxidation to form a ketone. But LiBH4 is a reducing agent, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve oxidation but some kind of cyclization where the ketone is retained. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction opens it to form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone via elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a hemiacetal formation. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration (R or S) is determined by the configuration of the starting material, because the reduction would lead to the same configuration. So, if the starting material is R, the product is R, and if it's S, the product is S.

But in the problem, reaction A gives R, reaction B gives S. So, if the starting materials are enantiomers, then the products would be enantiomers, which makes sense.

So, looking at the options:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, if starting material A is R, and B is S, then using different reagents, perhaps the product configurations are R and S, respectively.

Wait, but why would using different reagents (LiBH4 vs BH3) lead to opposite configurations?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the product's configuration to be opposite to the starting material's configuration.

But I'm not sure about that. Another angle: the reducing agents might influence the formation of the ring in a way that affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, but the choice of reducing agent (LiBH4 vs BH3) affects the pathway, leading to the opposite configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps one reagent leads to retention of configuration, and the other leads to inversion.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, let me think about the options. The only option where A and B are enantiomers is option D: A is R, B is S.

So, if reaction A uses LiBH4, which perhaps doesn't change the configuration, then product is R. Reaction B uses BH3, which perhaps inverts the configuration, leading to S.

Alternatively, the reagents could affect the stereochemistry in different ways.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, I think option D is the correct one, where A is R and B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which exists in either (R) or (S) configuration.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone (pyran-2-one) with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reaction conditions.

2. **Reagents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters and ketones to alcohols. It can influence the stereochemistry of the product based on the starting material's configuration.
   - **BH3**: Often used in hydroboration reactions, but in this context, it likely reduces the starting material to produce the opposite stereochemistry compared to LiBH4.

3. **Starting Material**:
   - The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which has a chiral center at C5. The stereochemistry of this center (R or S) determines the stereochemistry of the product.

4. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - Reaction A (LiBH4) produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - Reaction B (BH3) produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - This suggests that the starting materials for A and B must be enantiomers (R and S configurations, respectively) to yield the observed enantiomeric products.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both starting materials are (S). This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the given enantiomeric products.
   - **Option B**: Both starting materials are (R). Similarly, this would result in both products being (R), which is inconsistent with the question.
   - **Option C**: Starting material A is (S), and starting material B is (R). This would produce (S) and (R) products, respectively, which matches the given enantiomeric products.
   - **Option D**: Starting material A is (R), and starting material B is (S). This would produce (R) and (S) products, respectively, which also matches the given enantiomeric products.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Both options C and D are consistent with the enantiomeric products. However, the question implies that the starting materials are distinct enantiomers, and the correct pairing is A = (R) and B = (S), as stated in option D.

ANSWER: D
