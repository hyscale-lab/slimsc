Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their spatial density is constant. So the number density of stars doesn't change with distance. Wait, but how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. So distance increases as parallax decreases.

If stars are uniformly distributed, their number per unit volume is constant. But when we look in the sky, we're considering a thin shell of stars at a certain distance, so the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume of the shell.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at radius d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So we need to express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, so substituting d into the expression.

Wait, let's express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ). But the negative sign indicates direction, which we can ignore since we're dealing with magnitudes. So the number of stars in a shell with parallax plx to plx + d plx is n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. The shell's volume is 4π d² dd. But since d is in terms of plx, substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx. So 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But that would mean that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). But wait, no. Because the number of stars in that shell is n multiplied by the volume, so number = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number of stars per unit plx would be number / d plx, which gives 4π n / plx^4. So the number per unit range of plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems really steep. Let me think again. Because the number per unit plx (d plx) is the number of stars in that thin shell. So when plx is small (which is when distance is large, since plx = 1/d), the volume per plx unit becomes bigger because for a small plx, a tiny change in plx corresponds to a larger change in d. Oh wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance, which is uniform. So the number density is n stars/parsec^3. So the number of stars between distance d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd. Then, in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, that becomes n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx. Because dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So putting it all together, the number of stars is n * 4π * (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx (d plx) is n * 4π / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as 1 over plx to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but why is the exponent 4? Because of the d^2 from the surface area and the dd which introduces another d. Since d is 1/plx, each d contributes a 1/plx, so d^2 is 1/plx² and dd is 1/plx² d plx. So together, 1/plx² (from d²) multiplied by 1/plx² (from dd) gives 1/plx^4. So yeah, the factor is 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The question assumes a uniform distribution of stars, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant in space.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume of the shell in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to \( n \times 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \), where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars. Dividing by \( d\text{plx} \) to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we get:

\[
\text{Number per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
