Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. We're to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and the speed of light is c. Oh right, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formulas.

Wait, in the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(k A²/m), right? But because this is relativistic, I guess we have to consider the effects of special relativity. So the speed can't exceed the speed of light, c.

In special relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (gamma m v²)/2 if it's relativistic. But wait, actually, the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) m c², but sometimes people model things in different ways.

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum and the potential is zero. So E = (1/2) k A².

Wait, but wait a second. In the classical case, E is (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, how is the energy expressed?

Hmm, perhaps we need to think about the total energy. The total energy of the oscillator must be the same at all points in the motion. So when the particle is at x = A, all energy is potential, E = (1/2)k A². But wait, in relativity, the potential energy might not just be (1/2)k A². Oh wait, no, the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -k x, which implies the potential is still (1/2)k x². But the kinetic energy is different because of relativity.

So total energy E = (1/2) k A² (since at x=A, all energy is potential). But when the particle is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E = (gamma - 1) m c². Because in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, so setting these equal:

At x=0: E = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So gamma = (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) + 1.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So I can solve for v_max.

Let me write down the equation:

gamma = ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + 1.

Wait, no: E = (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c^2.

So (1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c^2.

So gamma = ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + 1.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let's let B = (k A²)/(2 m c^2). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + B.

Then, square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + B)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

Which can be written as v^2 = c² (1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ).

Take square root:

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ).

But what is B? It's (k A²)/(2 m c^2). Let me plug that in:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, looking at the options, option D is:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So that seems to match. Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option C is sqrt(k A²/m), which is the classical case, so it's probably not the right answer here.

Option A and B... Hmm. Let's see. For example, option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c^2)) )).

Wait, but in my calculation, I have 1/(1 + B)^2, so I don't think that's matching any of the other options except D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

So, the setup: Total energy E is (1/2)k A^2 because at x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A^2. Then, when at equilibrium (x=0), kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m c². So E = that.

So (1/2)k A^2 = (gamma -1) m c².

gamma is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then, as before, 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So when I square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Then, rearranged:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)) )^2.

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach is to think about energy including relativistic kinetic energy. Maybe I made a mistake in how I calculated the energy.

Alternatively, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So at x=A, KE is zero, so E = (1/2) k A². At x=0, KE is maximum, so E = K.E. = (gamma m c^2) - m c^2.

So (gamma m c^2 - m c^2) = (1/2) k A^2.

So, gamma = ( (1/2 k A^2 ) + m c^2 ) / (m c^2 )

= ( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) + 1 )

Which is the same as before. So that seems correct.

So yes, the correct equation leads to option D.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Option D is written as c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 )

So the formula I have is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + B)^2] )

Which is same as option D.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering the total energy of the system. The potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \) is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero at this point. At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy remains conserved.

In relativistic mechanics, the total energy \( E \) is given by \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. The kinetic energy is then \( K = (\gamma - 1)m c^2 \). Setting the total energy equal at all points, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)m c^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation and the correct expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).
