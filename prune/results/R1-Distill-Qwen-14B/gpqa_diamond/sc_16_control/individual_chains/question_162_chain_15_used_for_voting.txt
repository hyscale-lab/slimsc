Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, wait, what's a pseudosphere? From what I remember, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape but more symmetrical. It's one of those space-filling curves, right?

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I need to find the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, what's the relation between the metric and the radius here?

I think the metric probably defines the geometry of the space, and from that, I can compute the area. The pseudosphere's area formula might be similar to a sphere's, but since it's a hyperbolic surface, the formula would be different.

Wait, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, I think the area is infinite. Because as you go further from the center, the area keeps increasing without bound. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Or is it?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. A sphere has finite area, but a pseudosphere, which is like a tractricoid, is also a finite surface with infinite extent? No, no, I think a pseudosphere is a surface that's finite in area but extends infinitely in some direction. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given here represents a hyperbolic space, and the area is infinite. Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, which are coordinates. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the coordinates are constrained where x² + y² <4. Because if x² + y² equals 4, the denominator is zero, leading to singularities.

Wait, but the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so the metric would have issues when x² + y² approaches 4. That probably means that the space is only defined for x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, the metric is for a 2-dimensional space because the line element is in terms of dx and dy. So this is a 2D metric, and the space is a hyperbolic plane or something similar.

Wait, hyperbolic plane models. There are several models of hyperbolic geometry. The Poincaré disk model uses a similar form. The metric for the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in polar coordinates. Hmm, but the given metric is in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's using Cartesian coordinates instead of polar.

Wait, in the given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which in polar coordinates would be (4 - r²). So the metric becomes (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, wait, but the given expression is 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So in terms of r, which is sqrt(x² + y²), that's 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²). But dx² + dy² is r² dr² + r dθ² (or something like that?), no, wait, actually, dx² + dy² = r² dr² + r² dθ². Hmm, so the metric in polar coordinates would be (32/(4 - r²)) (r² dr² + r² dθ²) ) = (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ( dr² + dθ² ). Wait, but that's not matching the standard Poincaré disk model.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate, less than 1. So in our case, maybe the given metric is similar but scaled.

Wait, let's think about scaling. Let me write the given metric in polar coordinates. Since x² + y² = r², the given metric in polar coordinates would be:

ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²) = (32)/(4 - r²) (r² dr² + r² dθ²) )

So, simplifying, that's (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ( dr² + dθ² )

Hmm, comparing that to the standard Poincaré model, which is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but in our case, the coefficient is (32 r²)/(4 - r²) for dr² and dθ².

Alternatively, perhaps another model of hyperbolic space. Maybe the metric is for a hyperbolic plane with a different curvature.

The area of a pseudosphere would correspond to the area of a model of hyperbolic space. But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, maybe the given metric is that of a pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, I think the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface embedded in 3D space) usually has a specific form. But I'm more familiar with the metrics in different coordinate systems for hyperbolic space.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a 2D space, and the question is to find the area of the entire space as defined by this metric.

Because the metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), the allowed region for x and y is where 4 - x² - y² >0, so x² + y² <4. So the coordinates x and y are only defined within a circle of radius 2. So the space is a disk of radius 2 in these coordinates.

Wait, but the metric isn't Euclidean. It's a scaled metric. So the area can be computed using the standard formula for area in a metric space: the area is the integral over the region of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in 2D, the metric tensor is diagonal, and the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms.

Wait, more accurately, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. Since the metric here is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². In our case, the metric is diagonal: g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, but wait, no, the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} - (g_{xy})^2. Since g_{xy}=0, determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2.

Wait, but when you compute the area element, it's sqrt(det g) dx dy. So the area element dA would be (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But wait, actually, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, but in our case, the metric is diagonal, so sqrt(det g) is (32/(4 - r²)). So dA = (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

Wait, but that's only correct if the metric is in terms of coordinate differentials dx and dy. But wait, the metric is written as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²), so the metric tensor is diagonal with components (32/(4 - r²), 32/(4 - r²) ) in the dx and dy directions. So the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]^2, and sqrt of that is 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, no, because the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2) dx dy, which is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 -0 ) dx dy = (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because as r approaches 2 (since x² + y² <4), the denominator approaches zero. So the area element becomes larger and larger, which suggests that the area is infinite. Because the integral over the disk x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy would diverge as r approaches 2.

Wait, let me compute the area integral. The area would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Switching to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Taking out constants: 32 * ∫0^2π dθ ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral is 2π.

So the integral becomes 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr. Let me make a substitution u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr. So -(1/2) du = r dr.

The integral becomes ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (1/u) (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, u=4 - (2)^2=0. At r=0, u=4.

So the definite integral is [ (-1/2) ln(0) ) - ( (-1/2) ln(4) ) ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the pseudosphere is a finite surface. Or am I misunderstanding the question?

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the metric given is of a pseudosphere with radius 2, and I need to compute its area.

Wait, the pseudosphere's area is 4π a², but wait, I'm not sure. Or is it different because of the negative curvature?

Wait, another approach: what's the Gaussian curvature of this metric? For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative and constant. So perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to check if it's a pseudosphere.

In 2D, the Gaussian curvature K can be computed using the formula involving the metric components. Alternatively, for a metric of the form ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the curvature is related to the derivative of f.

Alternatively, in our case, since the metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²) in Cartesian coordinates. Let me see, in polar coordinates, that's (32 r²)/(4 - r²) (dr² + (dθ²)/r^0?), wait, no, dx² + dy² is r² dr² + r² dθ². So in polar coordinates, ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) ( r² dr² + r² dθ² ) = (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ( dr² + dθ² ). So it's written as ds² = A(r) (dr² + dθ² ), where A(r) = (32 r²)/(4 - r²).

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in terms of A(r) is:

K = - (1/(2 A)) d/dr (A(r) ) 

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, another formula for K is:

For a metric ds² = a(r)^2 dr² + b(r)^2 dθ², the curvature is given by:

K = [1/(a b)] [ (b''/a) - (b' a')/a² + (b' a')/a² - (a'' b)/b² ) ] ?

Hmm, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, another approach: the Gaussian curvature K for a metric in polar coordinates is given by:

K = [1/(2 r a(r)^2)] [ 2 a(r) r (d/d r)(a(r)/r) - a(r) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, I remember that for the Poincaré disk model, which has metric ds² = (4/(1 - r^2)^2)(dr² + r² dθ² ), the Gaussian curvature is -1. So maybe I can compare the given metric to the Poincaré model.

Wait, our metric after conversion to polar is (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ( dr² + dθ² ). Let me factor out the 32/(4 - r²) and see:

Let me write it as ( (32 r²) )/(4 - r²) dr² + ( (32 r²) )/(4 - r²) dθ².

Wait, that's ( (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ( dr² + dθ² )

Compare this to the Poincaré disk model: (4/(1 - r²)^2) ( dr² + r² dθ² ). Hmm, not the same, because the coefficients are different.

Wait, perhaps I can perform a coordinate transformation to see if it's a scaled version.

Alternatively, perhaps the area being infinite implies that the correct answer is D, which is +infty.

Because the integral for the area is divergent, as we saw earlier, the area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, what's the question again? It asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps I'm confused because I thought the pseudosphere has a finite area, but according to the metric, the area is infinite.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Pseudosphere is a surface in 3D space, but the metric given here is a 2D metric. So perhaps the question is about a 2D hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the terms mixed up. Let me think again.

In 3D, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's a finite surface. But in 2D, a hyperbolic plane is infinite in extent, so its area is infinite.

So perhaps the given metric is describing a hyperbolic plane, and the area is infinite. Therefore, the answer is D) +infty.

Alternatively, the question might be about the area of the universal cover of the pseudosphere, which would be the hyperbolic plane, which is infinite.

Hmm, given the options, option D is +infty, which would be the case if the area is infinite.

The problem involves finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \), given the metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Metric**:  
   The metric defines a 2D space with coordinates \( x \) and \( y \), constrained by the condition \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This ensures the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) remains positive, avoiding singularities.

2. **Area Element**:  
   In 2D, the area element \( dA \) is given by \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( g \) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant of \( g \) is \( \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2 \), so the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

3. **Integral for Total Area**:  
   The total area is obtained by integrating \( dA \) over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), \( \theta \)), the integral becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Evaluating the Integral**:  
   The \( \theta \)-integration yields \( 2\pi \), leaving:
   \[
   A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral simplifies to:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \ln(4 - r^2) \Big|_0^2.
   \]
   As \( r \to 2 \), \( \ln(4 - r^2) \to \ln(0) \), which diverges to \( -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges, and the total area is infinite.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The metric describes a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite extent and infinite area. While a pseudosphere (a finite surface in 3D) has a finite area, the given metric corresponds to a 2D hyperbolic space, whose area is infinite.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
