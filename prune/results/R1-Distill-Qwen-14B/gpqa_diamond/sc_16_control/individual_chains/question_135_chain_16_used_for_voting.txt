Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question gives me the interaction Lagrangian and the mass of the boson X, which is 6 GeV. I need to find out what particles X can decay into kinematically at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, no, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, it's probably something like L_int = -λ ψ_f^† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, perhaps that's more like a Yukawa coupling term. So the boson X couples to fermion ψ_f with a coupling λ, and the term is similar to Yukawa interaction where the scalar (here, X) couples to fermions.

So the interaction term would allow X to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs, right? So X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle if the mass allows it.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for any decay X → f f̄, the sum of the rest masses of f and f̄ must be less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a decay to be possible, the mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products (if they're particles, not considering energy/momentum aspects beyond that).

So I need to list all the fermions whose mass is less than 3 GeV each. Because 2m_f < 6 GeV → m_f < 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions? Let's recall:

- Electron (e): negligible, like 0.0005 GeV. So way below 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. Also way below.
- Tau (τ): around 1.77 GeV. So 2m_τ ≈ 3.55 GeV, which is a bit over 3 GeV. Wait, but wait, 1.77 * 2 is 3.54, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, X is 6 GeV, so 2m_f needs to be less than 6, but for tau, 2m_τ is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau can be a decay product.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, X is 6 GeV. So for decay into f and f̄, each f must be less than 3 GeV (since 2m < 6 → m <3). So let's list all possible fermions with m <3 GeV.

Quarks:

Up quark (u): mass around 2-4 MeV, negligible. So yes.
Down quark (d): similar, a few MeV.
Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV, so yes.
Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 2m_c ≈ 2.4-3 GeV. Wait, 2*1.5 is 3. So if X is 6 GeV, then 2m_c is about 3 GeV, so decay into c c̄ is allowed. Because 3 GeV <6 GeV.

But wait, the top quark (t) is about 173 GeV, way too heavy. So t is out.

What about bottom quark (b)? Its mass is around 4.5-5 GeV. Oh wait, 2m_b would be around 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. Because 2m_b is about 10 GeV, which is more than 6. So that's not allowed kinematically.

So for quarks, u, d, s, c are allowed. Because their masses are below 3 GeV (each). For example, c is up to 1.5 GeV, so 2c is 3 GeV, which is under 6.

Leptons:

Electron (e), muon (mu), tau (tau). Let's check their masses:

e: ~0.0005 GeV → allowed.
mu: ~0.105 GeV → allowed.
tau: ~1.777 GeV → 2m_tau ≈3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So decay into tau+ tau- is allowed.

What about the others? Well, neutrinos have negligible mass, but they are also leptons. But X can't decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs because the coupling in the Lagrangian would depend on whether X interacts with neutrinos. Wait, in the given Lagrangian, is the interaction with neutrinos included?

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f f-bar X. Wait, no, more accurately, the term is ψ_f^\dagger (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). So ψ_f would be a fermion field. If the fermion is a neutrino, does X couple to it? Well, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are leptons, and if the coupling is to all fermions, then yes. But in the given Lagrangian, the term is written as ψ_f, which could be any fermion. So in principle, X can decay into any fermion as long as the mass condition is met.

But neutrinos have nearly zero mass, so X could decay into νν̄. But the options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps the question is only considering charged leptons and quarks. Or maybe the coupling is only to charged fermions. Hmm, the problem statement isn't explicit, but the options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps it's not considered here.

So, considering the possible decay products, the fermions whose mass is less than 3 GeV are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c.

Leptons: e, mu, tau.

So possible decay channels would be into any of these fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is too heavy. So Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A can't be correct.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. No b, which is correct.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

No, t is too heavy. So C includes t, which is not allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b which is not allowed. So D is out.

So the correct options are B.

Wait, but let me double-check the quark masses. For charm quark, mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c = 3 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV. So c is allowed, which is in option B.

Also, what about s quark? Mass is around 95-100 MeV, so 2m_s is about 0.19-0.2 GeV, which is way under 6 GeV. So yes, s is allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? No, t is about 173 GeV, so way too heavy. So the only quarks allowed are u, d, s, c.

So the decay products are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, and the charged leptons: tau, mu, e. Wait, in the options, I should look for these.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option B says: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's exactly the decay channels we're expecting.

So the answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is allowed if the total mass of the decay products, \( 2m_f \), is less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u, d, s \): These quarks have masses much less than 3 GeV, so \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s} \) are allowed.
   - \( c \): The charm quark has a mass of approximately 1.5 GeV, so \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to c \bar{c} \) is allowed.
   - \( b, t \): The bottom quark (\( b \)) has a mass of approximately 4.5-5 GeV, and the top quark (\( t \)) is much heavier (\( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)). Both exceed the mass threshold, so \( X \to b \bar{b}, t \bar{t} \) are not allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e, \mu \): The electron and muon have masses much less than 3 GeV, so \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^- \) are allowed.
   - \( \tau \): The tau lepton has a mass of approximately 1.777 GeV, so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \) is allowed.

3. **Neutrinos**: While neutrinos have negligible mass, the problem does not explicitly include them in the options, so they are not considered here.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed kinematically. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed kinematically. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed kinematically. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.
