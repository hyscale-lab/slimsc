Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reaction mechanisms, but let's see.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. Finally, we're looking at the 1H NMR of product 3 and need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

First, let me think about each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) at 240°C. KOH with dibrominated compounds usually leads to elimination reactions, especially with vicinal dihalides. That's the E2 mechanism, forming alkenes. So, when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, eliminating HBr would lead to a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, wait, no, wait—wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, adamantane has a diamondoid structure. So, the molecule must be in a structure where the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but in an adamantane structure, the positions are a bit tricky. Anyway, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? Hmm. Because if you have Br on 1 and 3, and eliminate across 1-2 and 3-2? Wait, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but wait, 1,3-dibromo would not be vicinal. Oh wait, maybe the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. Because in the product, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Because 1720 is usually for C=O stretch in aldehydes or ketones. So, maybe the KOH first caused elimination, but wait, elimination would form an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't elimination but substitution. Because KOH is a strong base. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double elimination, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, elimination, forming an alkene. But the product has a ketone, so perhaps a subsequent reaction.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows 1720 cm-1. Let me think: if we have an elimination, perhaps it's forming a diene, but no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex reaction. Wait, what if the initial reaction is a ring-opening? Because adamantane is a polycyclic structure. But heating with KOH might induce some ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH could undergo a double elimination, each Br leaving and forming two double bonds, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps, it's an example of a Hofmann elimination or some other type. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, but the product's IR has a C=O stretch. So maybe a ketone is formed. How can that happen from a dibromide with KOH?

Oh! Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-type rearrangement, but that's for 1,2-diols. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a carbonyl via oxidation, but KOH is basic, not oxidizing. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps KOH induces elimination to form an alkene, and then further oxidation forms a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming an allene or a conjugated diene. But that may not lead to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 peak is probably two equivalent protons, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2, perhaps near an electronegative group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent protons, perhaps in a cyclohexane-like ring or multiple equivalent CH2 groups.

Wait, if product 1 has a C=O group, maybe it's a ketone. So, if the initial diBr is on a bridgehead, elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not possible in adamantane due to Bredt's rule. So elimination to form a double bond isn't feasible here. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Brs, perhaps each OH- attacks a different carbon. But that would form a diol, but how would that lead to a ketone? Unless a subsequent oxidation occurs, but KOH is basic, not oxidizing.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 would be a ketone, not an epoxide (epoxides have higher wavenumbers, around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretch). So back to the ketone idea.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone, a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl, but that would give a diol. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxide, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH induces a rearrangement. For example, in the presence of a strong base, a dihalide might undergo elimination to form a carbonyl group via a neighboring group participation. But I'm not certain about this mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening to form a ketone. For example, if the molecule is a bridge structure, removing two bromines and forming a carbonyl. But I'm not exactly clear on how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism, but that seems too much.

Wait, let me think about the product. The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so likely a ketone. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around where the protons adjacent to an oxygen (like in an ether or ketone) might be. But wait, in a ketone, the alpha protons (next to carbonyl) usually show up around 2.1-2.6 ppm, but 4.79 is higher. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, forming two carbonyl groups. So, the product would be 1,3-diketone, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent group. Wait, the NMR peak at 4.79 (2H, maybe a CH2-O- group. So if there's an oxygen adjacent, perhaps an ether or something. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the second step, which involves heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. That's a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts type reactions. But product 1 is a ketone, so perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, product 1 has a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane isn't aromatic. Unless the product 1 has a structure that allows for such a reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that would require a diene and a dienophile.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide because I'm thinking about the NMR. Wait, the 4.79 ppm would fit for an epoxide's protons. Because protons adjacent to an oxygen in an epoxide ring typically show up around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 is a bit high, but possible.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, then when you treat it with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's facilitating a ring-opening. But what would that lead to? Maybe a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but going back, product 1's IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, then step two is treating it with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an acetylation? Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and step two is an acid-catalyzed aldol condensation, but that would require another carbonyl group.

Wait, but the question is a bit tricky. Let me try to think about each step again.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH. KOH is a strong base. If it's a dihalide, perhaps elimination occurs, but given the structure of adamantane, the positions might allow for the formation of a ketone via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the two Brs are replaced by something else.

Wait, another reaction: The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction involves the bromination of carboxylic acids with a catalyst, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then how to get a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would form a conjugated diene, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. How?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. So if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, eliminating both could form two carbonyls.

Wait, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, are the two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? Because in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is bonded to three others. So, 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Hmm. Maybe they are on opposite ends. So elimination wouldn't form a double bond because they're not adjacent. So that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about ring-opening. KOH might cause the adamantane ring to open, leading to a structure with carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of the dibromide to a diol, but that would give a diol, not a ketone. Unless it's a neighboring group participation leading to a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) under acid conditions loses water to form a carbonyl compound. But in our case, the reaction is with KOH, which is a base. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is formed and then oxidizes, but that would require an oxidizing agent, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an oxide. But that would form an epoxide? Wait, an epoxide is a three-membered ring with two adjacent oxygen atoms. But with two Brs on non-adjacent carbons, perhaps it's a diepoxide? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution forms a glycol, but how that leads to a ketone is unclear.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. So the initial reaction must have converted the diBr into a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the diBr is converted to a diol, and then the diol is oxidized to a diketone. But oxidation usually requires an oxidizing agent, and KOH is a base. Unless it's an acid-catalyzed mechanism, but I don't think so.

Wait, another angle: Maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the diBr is in a position that allows for the formation of a carbonyl group via a neighboring group mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of a Hofmann elimination, but that typically forms amines. Not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a carbonyl via a double elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a cyclopropane, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridged bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. But as I thought earlier, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule, so that's not likely. Hence, elimination would not be possible, so maybe the reaction is substitution to form a diol, which then somehow becomes a ketone. But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is adamantanone. Let's assume that product 1 is a ketone, as per the IR. So, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, becomes adamantanone.

Now, moving to product 2: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used for Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. But since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's acting as a dienophile or undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If it's treated with Al isopropoxide, which is used in Friedel-Crafts, but if product 1 is already a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic step in forming an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Al isopropoxide is causing it to undergo a ring-opening. Or, perhaps product 1 is undergoing a Claisen condensation, but that's usually for esters.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. If so, under Friedel-Crafts conditions, maybe it undergoes a aldol condensation? But I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, maybe the second step is a Diels-Alder reaction, where the ketone is the dienophile. But for that, you need a diene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is coordinating to the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, and then another reaction occurs. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an acetylation product. If product 1 has a ketone, maybe it's getting another acyl group added. But I don't have enough info.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a more complex ketone, perhaps with a new ring formed.

Let me think about the third step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide is added. That's a standard ozonolysis condition. So product 3 would be the result of cleaving any double bonds present in product 2.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 is a ketone without any double bonds, then ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Hmm. Wait, but the ozone is bubbled through a solution, so maybe product 2 has a diene or some kind of conjugated system.

Wait, but for ozonolysis to occur, there must be a double bond. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, but the second step is product 1 (a ketone) heated with Al isopropoxide. So perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have a double bond.

Wait, if product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. But ozone tends to cleave conjugated dienes or isolated alkenes into carbonyl compounds.

So, let's try to tie this together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (a ketone, adamantanone?).

Step 2: product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2, which is perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Step 3: ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3 with certain NMR features.

So, now, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR. The deshielded protons are usually those near electronegative groups or in a conjugated system. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons.

Let me think about product 3. If product 2 was an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would typically break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, ozonolysis of an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) would produce a diketone. The mechanism involves cleavage of the double bond and formation of carbonyl groups on each fragment. So, if product 2 was an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, product 3 would be a diketone.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be on a carbonyl group, but in diketones, the protons adjacent to carbonyls are usually around 2.1-2.3 ppm. However, if the structure leads to a conjugated system, the protons could be more deshielded.

Wait, but if product 3 is a diketone, perhaps it's something like a 1,4-diketone. But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those exchangeable with solvent.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, there are protons adjacent to carbonyl groups that are coupled to two or more neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis of product 2 (which has a conjugated diene) leads to a pair of carbonyl groups, the resulting product could have protons that are in a conjugated system.

Wait, but I'm not entirely clear. Let's try to think about the possible structures.

Assuming product 1 is adamantanone, a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treatment with Al isopropoxide. Maybe Al isopropoxide is used to create an enol ether from the ketone, which would form a conjugated double bond. So, product 2 could be an enol ether with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enolate, but that's under basic conditions, while Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, maybe under acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: When a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, perhaps it can induce the formation of an acylium ion or something similar, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, a conjugated diene adjacent to a ketone, which would allow for further Diels-Alder reactions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a bridgehead double bond, but as I thought earlier, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. The structure of product 2 must have a double bond, so product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The NMR of product 3 would therefore show protons adjacent to these carbonyls, which are usually in the 2-3 ppm region.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative atoms or in an electronegative environment, like next to a carbonyl group.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that this proton is next to two other protons. For example, if it's in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each of those CH2 protons are next to another CH2 group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, but in the case of a diketone, the structure might have two ketone groups, each attached to a CH2 group. So, for example, if the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that's unlikely because the actual structure is determined by the previous steps.

Alternatively, consider a five-membered ring with two ketones. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the structure might have a central CH group with two ketone groups on either side. But that's speculative.

Wait, but for the coupling pattern, let's think about the number of neighboring protons. If a proton is next to two sets of protons, each of which is split into multiple peaks, the coupling pattern becomes a doublet of triplets, or a triplet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, each with a different J value, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: The most deshielded proton is likely part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, each of its protons would couple with the two protons in the adjacent group, leading to a triplet. But if each proton in the adjacent group is split further, the pattern becomes more complex.

Alternatively, if each proton in the CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of protons, say, one from each neighboring group, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is a pentet, which would arise if the proton is coupled to four equivalent protons (e.g., in a CH2-CH2-CH2 situation). But that would require four neighboring protons, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, if a proton is adjacent to two protons on one side and another two on the other, and each set has the same J value, it would split into a triplet of triplets, making a total of 3x3=9 lines, but that's not one of the options. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Alternatively, if a proton is next to two protons on one side and another two on the other, but with different coupling constants, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group that's next to two sets of two protons each, leading to triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: perhaps after ozonolysis, product 3 is a diketone with a central CH group. So, the structure could be something like O=C-R-CH-R'-CO. The central CH would have protons that are split based on neighboring groups.

Wait, but in a diketone, the central CH would be adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Each CH would have two protons (if CH2), but wait, CH would have only one proton. No, wait, if it's a CH2 group, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2. So, the protons on each CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's protons.

In such a case, each CH2 would have two protons, each coupling to the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each proton on CH2 would be a triplet (due to two neighboring protons), and because each of those neighboring protons are part of a triplet, the overall pattern might be a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but for a CH2-CH2 group, the protons on each CH2 are split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2. So, each CH2 would show up as a triplet. So, the coupling pattern for each proton would be a triplet.

But if there are more complex couplings, like if each proton is also coupled to another set, perhaps it would be a triplet of triplets. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2. Each proton in the CH2 would see two protons from the adjacent group. So, each would be a triplet. So, the NMR would show a triplet for each CH2.

But wait, the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be more deshielded, so perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have protons that are split into triplets.

But looking back at the options, option A is triplet, which fits this scenario.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, the protons would be deshielded and each would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But in the options, if that's the case, option A would be the answer. However, considering that the most deshielded proton might be in a more complex environment, perhaps coupled to more than two protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group next to two different CH2 groups. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH(CH2X)-CH2Y-CO, then the central CH would have two sets of neighboring protons: the two on CH2X and the two on CH2Y. Each of these couplings could split the proton into a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, the CH group would have one proton. If that proton is coupled to two protons on one side and two on the other, each with a different coupling constant, it would split into a doublet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Let me try to think of another approach.

In the first step, product 1 is a ketone. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe that's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, such as an ether. But in a ketone, what would that be?

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone and has a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an oxygen substituent. For example, like cyclopentanone with an adjacent CH2O group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ketone or something similar, but that doesn't fit the adamantane structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure after KOH is a cyclic ether ketone. So, product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent epoxide ring. Then, the NMR would show the epoxide protons around 4.79 ppm as a triplet or something else.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm peak is due to a methine group (CH) adjacent to an oxygen. But then it would be a singlet, which isn't the case.

Wait, maybe it's a diastereotopic pair of protons, but that's more about splitting due to symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ozonolysis step.

If product 2 has a double bond, perhaps between carbons alpha and beta to the ketone, then ozonolysis would break that double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would be a diketone.

In this case, the structure of product 3 would have two ketone groups, and perhaps a CH2 group in between. The most deshielded protons would be the ones adjacent to the ketones.

Each of these protons would be part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of these CH2 groups would have two protons, each coupling with the two protons of the adjacent CH2 group. So, each would be a triplet.

So, the NMR would show a triplet for each of these CH2 groups. But if the coupling is between two sets of CH2 groups, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. The protons on each CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet for each. So, in the NMR, each of these would be a triplet. That would suggest option A.

But considering that each CH2 is next to another CH2, which is then next to another CH2, perhaps each CH2 is coupled to two different CH2 groups. So, each proton on a CH2 would couple with two protons from one side and two from the other, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a case where each proton is coupled to two on one side and two on the other, but with the same coupling constant. So, each proton would be a triplet of triplets. So, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, making option B the answer.

Alternatively, maybe each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to each CH2 being a triplet. So, the answer would be triplet, option A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example. Take 1,4-diketone with a CH2-CH2 group in the middle. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would give this structure. Each CH2 group would have protons that are each split by the two protons on the neighboring CH2. So, each would be a triplet.

So, the NMR would show a triplet for each CH2 group. Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen would be part of a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is such that each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, the protons would be more deshielded. Each would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, so each would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be triplet, option A.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is also adjacent to another group with more protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but according to the options, option B is a triplet of triplets, which would be if each proton is coupled to two sets of two protons each, with different J values.

Alternatively, maybe each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and each of those is adjacent to another CH2. So, each proton is coupled to two on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in the case of a simple CH2-CH2 group between two ketones, each CH2's protons would be coupled only to the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each would be a triplet.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but considering the options, I think the correct answer is option B, triplet of triplets, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another angle: When ozonolysis is done on a diene, it can produce two carbonyl groups. If the diene was part of a bridged structure, the resulting diketone might have a central CH group.

Wait, but that's getting too speculative. Another approach: The NMR of product 3 shows the most deshielded proton. If it's part of a CH group that's between two carbonyls, it would have a unique coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with a central CH2 group. So, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 is next to the other. The protons on each CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, each CH2 would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded protons would be in these CH2 groups, each showing a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Alternatively, if the central CH2 is between two carbonyls, perhaps each CH2 has another CH2 adjacent to it, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but in the given options, the only triplet options are A and B. If the splitting is a triplet of triplets, that would be due to coupling with two sets of two protons each.

But in the case of a CH2-CH2 group, each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2, so each proton would be a triplet due to coupling with two protons. So, product 3's CH2 would be triplets, making option A correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: maybe the structure after ozonolysis has more complex coupling, like being adjacent to two different groups. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2 and another CH group, leading to more splits.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging. Given the options and my reasoning, I think the most likely answer is triplet of triplets, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH, being a strong base, likely induces a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction. This forms a ketone, as indicated by the IR spectrum of product 1, which shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of a C=O stretch). The NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, possibly adamantanone.

---

### Step 2: Reaction with Al Isopropoxide
Product 1 (the ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) via a conjugate addition or rearrangement. The presence of Al isopropoxide could stabilize the intermediate, leading to a structure with a conjugated double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 (the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone) undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, producing a diketone (product 3). The structure of product 3 likely contains two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH₂ groups.

### Step 4: NMR Analysis of Product 3
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group that is coupled to neighboring protons. Each proton in the CH₂ group couples with two protons on one adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet. Additionally, if there are further couplings with protons on another adjacent group, the splitting pattern becomes a **triplet of triplets**.

### Critical Analysis of Options
- **Option A (triplet):** This would occur if the proton coupled with only two equivalent protons. However, the presence of additional couplings suggests a more complex splitting pattern.
- **Option B (triplet of triplets):** This matches the scenario where the proton couples with two protons on one side and two protons on another side, leading to a triplet of triplets.
- **Option C (doublet of triplets):** This would require coupling with one proton and two protons from different groups, which is less likely in this structure.
- **Option D (pentet):** This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

### Conclusion
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern due to its interaction with protons on adjacent CH₂ groups. 

**Answer: B**
