Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, the titration should proceed until all the acetic acid is neutralized, right?

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Wait, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh right, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the initial concentration after dilution would be 0.025 M. Because 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Okay, I need to find both. Let me think about each step.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the reaction would produce sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. I'll need to calculate the pH using the Kb of acetate.

But wait, let me get the moles right. The initial moles of acetic acid before dilution: M = moles/volume (cm³). So 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = 1 mole per liter * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles are still 0.001.

When titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added would be 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is (moles)/(concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH added, so 50 cm³. The sodium acetate concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

But wait, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO- ions. The acetate ion (CH3COO-) will hydrolyze in water. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

Equilibrium:
0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is small)
x^2 / 0.02 = Kb ≈ 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6. pH is 14 - pOH. pOH = log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH ≈ 14 -5.486 =8.514. Wait, but wait, the options don't have a pH of 8.52 except option A. Hmm, but wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Ok that part is correct.

Hydrolysis: Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 *5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.516; so 0.516 + (-6) → pOH=5.484. So pH=14-5.484=8.516. So about 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52, which would match option A's second value (4.26;8.52). But wait, let me check the first part.

Wait, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles.

So, let me think about the solution at 25% titration. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 25% of the required NaOH volume. Wait, no, because the volume of NaOH added is (moles)/(concentration) = 0.00025 /0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the concentrations of the species present. So, how much acetic acid and acetate are there?

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001. Moles reacted: 0.00025. So moles remaining: 0.00075. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025.

So the solution now has 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of acetate.

The total volume is 40 ml + 2.5 ml =42.5 ml =0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. So log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733 (because 5 - 0.267 =4.733).

So pH = 4.733 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647).

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256. Approximately 4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence, it's about 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. That's what I calculated. So I think the answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³ and a diluted concentration of 0.025 M. The solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, and we calculate the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25% of the NaOH added reacts with 25% of the acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of sodium acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.0200 \, \text{M} \):

\[
[OH^-]^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 \approx 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.
