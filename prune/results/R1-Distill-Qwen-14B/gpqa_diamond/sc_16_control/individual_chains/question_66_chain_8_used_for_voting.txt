Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. 

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations in space and time. Wait, I think Poincaré includes both Lorentz transformations and shifts in position and time. So if a theory has Poincaré symmetry, it automatically has Lorentz symmetry, right?

But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators that are compatible with the SM gauge symmetries. Now, about the symmetries... I remember that the SMEFT Lagrangian must be invariant under the SM gauge group, but what about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.?

So, the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. Let's think. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz and translational symmetries. But wait, in effective field theories, do we always require Poincaré symmetry? I think EFTs generally respect Lorentz symmetry because they're built from terms that are Lorentz scalars. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that's Lorentz invariant because the SM is, so all the operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translations. SMEFT includes terms that are dimension six, seven, etc. The leading term is the SM, which respects Poincaré. But when you add higher-dimension operators, do they have to respect Poincaré? Because each operator is a scalar (Lorentz and gauge invariant), but wait, Poincaré includes translations. The operators are built with derivatives, so their inclusion would require that the terms transform correctly under translations. But I think that because the operators are built in a way that the theory as a whole respects Poincaré, each operator must be a Poincaré scalar. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar and also a translation scalar. So operators must be invariant under both, meaning Poincaré symmetry must be respected. But wait, isn't Poincaré symmetry a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz? So if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is which must be enforced by all operators. So if Poincaré is part of the symmetry, then Lorentz is automatically included.

Wait, but the options given are 1,2,3,4. The question is which must be respected by all operators. So if all operators must be Poincaré invariant, then yes, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes EFTs might explicitly break Lorentz symmetry, but I don't think SMEFT does that. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Now, Poincaré symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré, and SMEFT is built upon the SM, I would think that all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. If that's the case, then options 1 and 2 are correct.

Next, CP symmetry. I know that the SM doesn't have a fundamental CP symmetry, except in some cases. Wait, no, the SM isn't CP symmetric because of things like the CKM matrix having complex phases leading to CP violation in the electroweak sector. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP symmetry either. Unless the operator is CP-even or something, but I think operators can violate CP. So not all operators must respect CP. So option 3 (CP symmetry) is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. Every operator must be such that the theory respects CPT. Because CPT is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. So in any Lorentz-invariant QFT, the theory must be CPT invariant. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is a must.

Putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz, so if all operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically satisfied. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is a must as part of it.

Wait, but the options are presented as separate choices. So the question is whether all operators must respect each symmetry individually. So let's think again. The SMEFT is built so that the entire Lagrangian is Poincaré-invariant. Each operator must be a Poincaré scalar, so their terms must be Poincaré-invariant. So yes, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar, so Poincare is required.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, CPT is a larger symmetry. So if the theory respects CPT, which is a combination of C, P, and T, but do the operators individually have to be CPT-symmetric? Or is the theory as a whole CPT-symmetric?

Hmm. Wait, the SM is CPT-symmetric. So any effective theory derived from the SM should also respect CPT. So for the SMEFT, which is an effective theory of the SM, all terms (operators) must contribute to a CPT-invariant theory. So each operator must be such that when you include them, the entire theory remains CPT-symmetric.

But how does that affect individual operators? For example, an operator might change the charge conjugation symmetry, but as long as the entire theory is CPT-invariant, that's okay. Or maybe each operator must be CPT-symmetric by itself.

Alternatively, perhaps each operator must transform in a way that when you apply CPT, the operator transforms to itself. For example, an operator might be a scalar under CPT. Because if an operator were to change under C, P, or T, then when you apply CPT, it must come back to itself. So each operator must be a CPT scalar.

But wait, let me think. Suppose an operator is a P-odd scalar. Then under CPT, it would transform as CPT (P-odd) would be T even? Not sure. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the only requirement is that the entire Lagrangian is CPT-invariant, so individual terms can violate individual symmetries as long as the sum is invariant. For example, the SM has CP violation, but it's still CPT-invariant.

Wait, but in the SM, the CKM matrix leads to CP violation, but CPT is still a symmetry. So the SM as a whole is CPT-invariant, but individual terms may not be. So perhaps in SMEFT, the operators can violate C, P, or T individually, but when combined with others, the total theory is CPT-invariant.

In that case, the individual operators don't have to be CPT-symmetric. So the requirement is that the entire theory is CPT-invariant, but individual operators can have various symmetry properties as long as the sum is CPT.

Hmm, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the theory as a whole must respect CPT, but individual operators may not, then the operators don't have to respect CPT themselves. So in that case, CPT is not a symmetry that each operator must respect.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps CPT symmetry is a combination of the other symmetries. Since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, which is part of Poincare, and the theory must respect CPT as per quantum field theory requirements. So for any operator, when you apply CPT, it should transform in a way that maintains the theory. So perhaps each operator must be a CPT scalar.

No, that can't be, because operators can have different transformation properties. For example, the fermion mass term in the SM is a scalar under CPT. But other operators could have different properties.

Wait, maybe all operators must be CPT-symmetric. Because if you have an operator that changes under C, P, or T, then when you apply CPT, it should come back to itself. So each operator must be a CPT scalar. Because otherwise, the overall theory might not be CPT-invariant.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the entire theory is CPT-invariant, but individual operators can transform in any way as long as the sum works out. In that case, the operators themselves don't have to be CPT-symmetric. So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but the options don't have all four. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the question is, which of the four symmetries must all operators respect.

I think Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) must be respected, and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3). So that would be options 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is required, so 1 and 2 are correct. Also, CPT is required (4). So C) is 1,2,4.

But wait, if Poincare is included, then Lorentz is part of that, so the operator must be a Poincare scalar, which includes being a Lorentz scalar. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare? Or is Poincare the only one needed because it includes Lorentz?

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. So that would be options 1,2,4. Which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure about Poincare. Because the operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars, and because the theory is built in a way that respects Poincare. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, meaning that Poincare is a must. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, as it is derived from the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must therefore be Lorentz scalars. Thus, Lorentz symmetry is a must.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Since SMEFT is constructed to respect the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that translational invariance is automatically satisfied alongside Lorentz symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the electroweak sector. As SMEFT is built from the SM, it does not necessarily require CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP symmetry individually, as long as the overall theory remains consistent. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement for any Lorentz-invariant theory. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. While individual operators may violate C, P, or T individually, the theory as a whole must remain CPT-invariant. Thus, CPT symmetry is a must.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.
