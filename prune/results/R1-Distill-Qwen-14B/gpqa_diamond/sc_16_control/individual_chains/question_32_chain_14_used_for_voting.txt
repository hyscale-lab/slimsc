Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that relativistic mechanics are involved here because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium, right? So natural Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that means the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

I need to find the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I think the formula for relativistic energy is needed here. The total energy E is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So let me write the formula down:

E = gamma * m * c²

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Substituting v as 0.96c, let me compute that. Let's calculate the denominator first: 1 - (0.96c)²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2.

What's 0.96 squared? 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is ^6Li, so I need the mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus. I think I can find the mass using the periodic table. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, but sometimes it's given as approximately 6.016 for Li-7? Wait no, wait. Let me think. Lithium-6 is lighter than Li-7. Let me check. I remember that the atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.013 u. So yes, I can go with that.

So m = 6.013 u. But I need to convert this into kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics equations is kg. Oh, right, 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m = 6.013 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me compute that.

Calculating 6 * 1.6605e-27 is about 9.963e-27 kg. Then 0.013 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 2.158e-29 kg. Adding them together: 9.963e-27 + 2.158e-29 = Approximately 9.98458e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 6.013 * 1.66053906660e-27.

6.013 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Let's compute 6 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27.

0.013 * 1.6605390666e-27 = 2.1586907866e-29.

Adding these: 9.9632343996e-27 + 2.1586907866e-29 = 9.98482130746e-27 kg.

So m ≈ 9.98482e-27 kg.

Now, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So E = gamma * m * c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, m is 9.98482e-27 kg, c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

Putting it all together:

E = 3.5714 * 9.98482e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 9.98482e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = ?

9.98482e-27 * 9e16 = (9.98482 *9) * 1e-27+16 = 89.86338 * 1e-11 = 8.986338e-10 (kg m²/s²) which is J, Joules.

Wait, but wait: 9e16 is 9 *1e16. So 9.98482e-27 * 9e16 = (9.98482 *9) * 1e(-27 +16) ) = 89.86338e-11 = 8.986338e-10.

Then multiply by gamma, 3.5714.

So 3.5714 * 8.986338e-10 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *8.986338.

3.5714 *8 is 28.5712.

3.5714 *0.986338 is approximately 3.5714 * 0.986 ≈ about 3.525.

So total ≈ 28.5712 + 3.525 = 32.0962.

So 3.5714 *8.986338 ≈ 32.0962, so 3.5714 *8.986338e-10 ≈ 32.0962e-10 = 3.20962e-9 J.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate:

Wait, 9.98482e-27 *9e16 = 9.98482 *9 =89.86338, exponents are 1e-27 +1e16 = 1e-11. So 89.86338e-11 = 8.986338e-10.

Then multiply by 3.5714:

3.5714 *8.986338e-10 = ?

Wait, 3.5714 *8.986338 = let's compute it exactly.

3.5714 * 8 = 28.5712.

3.5714 * 0.986338 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *0.986338.

3.5714 *0.9 = 3.21426

3.5714 *0.08 = 0.285712

3.5714 *0.006338 = approximately 0.0226.

Adding them up: 3.21426 + 0.285712 = 3.499972 + 0.0226 = 3.522572.

So total of 3.5714 *8.986338 is 28.5712 +3.522572 = 32.093772.

So 32.093772e-10 J.

Wait, so 3.2093772e-9 J.

But wait, J to eV conversion: 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So to get the energy in eV, divide by 1.60218e-19.

3.2093772e-9 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (3.2093772e-9) / (1.60218e-19) eV.

Calculating that:

3.2093772e-9 / 1.60218e-19 = (3.2093772 / 1.60218) * 1e10 ≈ (2) *1e10, since 3.2 is twice 1.6.

Wait, 3.2093772 divided by 1.60218 is approximately 2. So 2 * 1e10 eV = 2e10 eV.

Wait, but that can't be right because RHIC energies are in GeV, not TeV. So maybe I messed up the calculations somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept the units in GeV from the start. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should calculate gamma*m*c² in GeV.

I know that 1 u (atomic mass unit) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass of the nucleus is 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u.

So, 6.013 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute that. 6 *931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.013 *931.5 is about 12.11 MeV.

So total is 5589 + 12.11 = 5601.11 MeV, which is approximately 5.60111 GeV.

So m c² =5.60111 GeV.

Then, gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 *5.60111 GeV.

3.5714 *5.60111 ≈ let's compute that.

3 *5.60111 = 16.80333.

0.5714 *5.60111 ≈ 3.198.

Adding together: 16.80333 +3.198 ≈ 19.999 GeV, approximately 20 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419.

Wait, so why is this discrepancy? Because perhaps I didn't compute gamma accurately enough.

Wait, let me calculate gamma more precisely. Earlier, I said gamma was 1/0.28 = 3.5714, but let's be precise.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that's accurate.

So then, gamma is 3.57142857.

So the exact calculation: 3.57142857 *5.60111 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60111.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.60111 =16.80333.

0.57142857 *5.60111.

Wait, 0.5 *5.60111 is 2.800555.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14. So 5.60111 /14 = approx 0.400079.

So 0.5 part is 2.800555, 0.07142857 part is ~0.400079.

Adding the two parts: 2.800555 +0.400079 ≈3.200634.

So total E is 16.80333 +3.200634 ≈19.99996 GeV.

Wait, so approximately 20 GeV. But the options have C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the mass again.

The mass of ^6Li is 6.013 u. So 6.013 u.

But perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass. Let me look up the exact value. Oh wait, I'm just thinking, but I'll proceed with what I have.

Wait, perhaps using the exact gamma:

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Alternative approach: use exact calculation for gamma.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Let me check.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784? 0.28 *0.28 = 0.0784. Yes, exactly. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So m c² is 6.013 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.013 * 931.5.

Let me compute this more accurately.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.013 *931.5 =12.1095 MeV.

Total: 5589 +12.1095=5601.1095 MeV =5.6011095 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6011095 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6011095.

3 *5.6011095 =16.8033285.

0.57142857 *5.6011095.

Wait, 0.5 *5.6011095 =2.80055475.

0.07142857 *5.6011095.

Compute 5.6011095 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, so 5.6011095 /14 =0.40007925.

So 0.07142857 *5.6011095 ≈0.40007925.

So 0.5 part is 2.80055475, 0.07142857 part is 0.40007925.

Adding 2.80055475 +0.40007925 =3.200634.

So total E =16.8033285 +3.200634 =19.9999625 GeV.

Approximately 20 GeV. But none of the options are exactly 20 GeV. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV and option D:21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of ^6Li. Let me check that again. Maybe the exact mass is higher.

Wait, I think the exact mass of ^6Li is about 6.013 u. Let me confirm.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I should use the exact value of 1u in GeV.

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².

So m c² =6.013 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6.013 * 931.494.

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.013 *931.494 =12.109422 MeV.

So total m c² =5588.964 +12.109422 =5601.07342 MeV =5.60107342 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.60107342 GeV.

Compute that:

5.60107342 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

First, 5.60107342 ×3 =16.80322026.

5.60107342 ×0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is exactly 4/7.

So 5.60107342 *4/7 = (5.60107342 *4)/7.

5.60107342 *4 =22.40429368.

Divide by 7: 22.40429368 /7 =3.20061338.

So total E =16.80322026 +3.20061338 =19.99983364 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, wait, maybe I forgot to account for the fact that the nucleus is moving, and the kinetic energy might be required instead of the total energy. Oh wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy, not just the kinetic. Because in colliders, the total energy (including rest mass) is what's important.

So, the calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly 20. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used a wrong mass for the nucleus. Let me think again: ^6Li is Lithium-6, right? So the mass is 6.013 u? Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value.

Wait, according to some sources, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.013 u. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that the problem uses the mass of the proton and neutron separately. Wait, no, the nucleus is a ^6Li nucleus, so the mass is 6.013 u.

Wait, but maybe I should use the exact calculation of the atomic mass. Let me think: the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.013 u, but perhaps the actual calculation should consider that the nucleus is a combination of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, that's already accounted for in the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, but the question says 'energy', which usually refers to the total energy. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the gamma calculation when v is 0.96c is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation.

Wait, 0.96c is the speed. Let me compute gamma with more precise calculation.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Wait, so why is the calculation giving me about 20 GeV, but the options have 20.132 as option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a decimal point somewhere. Let me recheck the m c² calculation.

Wait, 6.013 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.013 *931.494.

Wait, let me compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.013 *931.494 =12.109422.

Adding them: 5588.964 +12.109422=5601.073422 MeV, which is 5.601073422 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.601073422 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.601073422.

Let me try a different approach: 3.57142857 is approximately 25/7, because 25/7≈3.5714.

5.601073422 is approximately 5601.073422 MeV.

So, 25/7 *5.601073422 GeV.

25/7 *5.601073422 = (25 *5.601073422)/7.

25 *5.601073422 =140.02683555.

Divide by 7: 140.02683555 /7 ≈20.00383365 GeV.

Ah, so approximately 20.0038 GeV.

But the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So 20.0038 is closest to option C, 20.132 GeV. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, let me double-check the exact mass of ^6Li.

Upon a quick check, the exact mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.013 u. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should account for the fact that the nucleus is moving relativistically and that the total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest mass energy. But the way I calculated already includes the rest mass, so it's the total energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute everything more accurately without approximations.

Let me compute gamma * m c² with more precise values.

gamma =3.5714285714.

m c² =5.601073422 GeV.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.601073422.

Compute this product precisely.

3.5714285714 *5.601073422.

Let me compute it step by step.

Calculate 5.601073422 *3 =16.803220266.

5.601073422 *0.5714285714.

Hmm, 0.5714285714 is 4/7.

So 5.601073422 *4 =22.404293688.

Divide by 7:22.404293688 /7 =3.200613384.

Now, add 16.803220266 +3.200613384 =20.00383365 GeV.

So E=20.00383365 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But option C is higher than 20.004 GeV.

Hmm, that's a difference of about 0.128 GeV. Maybe I need to consider more precise values for the atomic mass.

Wait, perhaps the atomic mass of ^6Li is more precisely 6.013 u. Let me see: if the exact mass is 6.013 u, then that's 6.013 *931.494 MeV =5601.07342 MeV, which is 5.60107342 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this without rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should take the exact value of 1 u as 931.494064 MeV/c².

So m c² =6.013 *931.494064 MeV.

Let me compute that.

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.013 *931.494064 =12.109422832 MeV.

Total m c² =5588.964384 +12.109422832 =5601.07380683 MeV =5.60107380683 GeV.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.60107380683 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.5714285714 *5.60107380683.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.60107380683.

Wait, 0.60107380683 is approximately 0.6 +0.00107380683.

So,

3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 *0.00107380683 ≈ approximately 0.003836.

Adding them: 2.1428571428 +0.003836 ≈2.146693.

So total E is 17.857142857 +2.146693 ≈20.003835857 GeV.

Wait, that's the same as before. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't have exactly this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy in a different way, or maybe considering the kinetic energy. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c." RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain energy. The energy is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in particle accelerators, the energy is typically the kinetic energy. But for heavy ions, sometimes the total energy (which includes rest mass) is used, especially in colliders where they collide head-on. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy instead.

Wait, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So let's compute that.

gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma-1 =2.57142857.

m c² is5.60107342 GeV.

So KE =2.57142857 *5.60107342 GeV ≈14.4 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14 GeV.

Hmm, but the options are higher than that. So perhaps the question refers to the total energy, which is what I computed before.

So, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, so option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to our calculated 20.0038 GeV. But it's about 0.13 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with higher precision.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) with more precision.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000.

sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the product 3.5714285714 *5.60107380683.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

3.5714285714 *5.60107380683 = ?

Let me use a calculator approach.

Multiply 3.5714285714 by 5.60107380683.

Let me write 3.5714285714 as 25/7.

25/7 *5.60107380683 = (25 *5.60107380683)/7.

25 *5.60107380683 =140.02684517075.

Divide by 7: 140.02684517075 /7 =20.0038350244 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV.

But none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the exact mass of ^6Li again.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.013 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass.

Wait, Li-6 has an exact mass of approximately 6.013 u. But perhaps I should look for a more precise value.

Wait, let me think: the exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.013 u, but perhaps the exact value is 6.01303 u. No, wait, perhaps more accurately, it's 6.013 u.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from using 931.494 MeV/u. Let me check that value.

Yes, 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².

So, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma to more decimal places.

Given that gamma is 3.5714285714, perhaps using more precise multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 3.5714285714 *5.60107380683 with more precise steps.

Let me compute it step by step:

5.60107380683 *3 =16.8032214205.

5.60107380683 *0.5714285714.

Wait, 0.5714285714 is exactly 4/7.

So 5.60107380683 *4/7.

5.60107380683 *4 =22.40429522732.

Divide by 7: 22.40429522732 /7 =3.2006136039 GeV.

Adding 16.8032214205 +3.2006136039 =20.0038350244 GeV.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 20.004 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.128 GeV higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think: the nucleus is ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c².

The mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So the total mass of ^6Li would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

But wait, that's the sum of individual protons and neutrons. However, the actual mass of ^6Li is less than that because of binding energy. So the actual mass is about 6.013 u, which is 6.013 *931.494 ≈5601.07 MeV.

So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the calculation of gamma. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.96²=0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No error there.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let's compute the kinetic energy.

KE = (gamma -1)*m c².

gamma is 3.5714285714.

So KE= (3.5714285714 -1) *5.60107380683 =2.5714285714 *5.60107380683.

Compute 2.5714285714 *5.60107380683.

Again, 2.5714285714 is 18/7.

So 18/7 *5.60107380683 = (18 *5.60107380683)/7.

18 *5.60107380683 =100.819328523.

Divide by 7: 100.819328523 /7 ≈14.4027612176 GeV.

So the kinetic energy is approximately 14.403 GeV. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer should be approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is perhaps more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating gamma as 3.5714 but using more decimal places.

Wait, let me compute gamma with more precision.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem refers to each ion having energy E, and since RHIC collides two beams, each with energy E, the total center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s)=2E gamma beta, but wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the RHIC accelerates each beam to energy E, and when they collide head-on, the total energy is sqrt(s)=2E gamma beta, but perhaps that's more complicated. But in this question, they're asking for the energy per beam, so perhaps the calculation is as I did before.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or other constants. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should use c=3e8 m/s, and compute everything in SI units, then convert to GeV.

Let me try that approach.

Compute E = gamma * m * c².

Gamma=3.5714285714.

m=6.013 u =6.013 *1.66053906660e-27 kg =9.9848213e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

c^2=9e16 m²/s².

So E=3.5714285714 *9.9848213e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s².

Compute this:

First, 9.9848213e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = (9.9848213 *9) *1e-27+16 =89.8633917 *1e-11 =8.98633917e-10 J.

Now multiply by gamma: 3.5714285714 *8.98633917e-10 J.

Compute 3.5714285714 *8.98633917e-10 =?

3.5714285714 *8.98633917 = let's compute this.

3 *8.98633917=26.95901751.

0.5714285714 *8.98633917 ≈0.5714285714 *8.98633917.

0.5 *8.98633917=4.493169585.

0.0714285714 *8.98633917≈0.640029764.

Adding them:4.493169585 +0.640029764≈5.1332.

So total 3.5714285714 *8.98633917≈26.95901751 +5.1332≈32.09221751.

So E=32.09221751e-10 J.

Now, convert J to GeV.

1 eV=1.602176634e-19 J.

1 GeV=1e9 eV.

So 1 GeV=1.602176634e-10 J.

So E (GeV)=32.09221751e-10 J / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) ≈32.09221751 /1.602176634 ≈20.03 GeV.

Hmm, so that's about 20.03 GeV, which is closer to option C:20.132 GeV. But not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 32.09221751e-10 /1.602176634e-10.

32.09221751 /1.602176634 ≈20.03 GeV.

So about 20.03 GeV.

Again, the options don't have that, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

I think perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I might have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me try with more precise values.

Mass of ^6Li:6.013 u.

1 u=931.494064 MeV/c².

So m c²=6.013 *931.494064 MeV.

6.013 *931.494064= let me compute.

6 *931.494064 = 5588.964384 MeV.

0.013 *931.494064 = 12.109422832 MeV.

Total=5588.964384 +12.109422832=5601.07380683 MeV.

So m c²=5601.07380683 MeV=5.60107380683 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

E=gamma * m c² =3.5714285714 *5.60107380683 GeV.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

3.5714285714 *5.60107380683.

Let me compute 3 *5.60107380683 =16.80322142.

0.5714285714 *5.60107380683.

0.5 *5.60107380683=2.8005369034.

0.0714285714 *5.60107380683 =0.400079257.

So adding 2.8005369034 +0.400079257=3.2006161604.

Total E=16.80322142 +3.2006161604=20.00383758 GeV.

So approximately 20.0038 GeV, which is about 20.004 GeV.

Again, the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again using more precise steps.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

That's correct.

So I'm confident my calculation is correct, leading to approximately 20.0038 GeV.

But the options given don't have this. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is 6 *938.272 MeV (protons) +3 *939.565 MeV (neutrons) = but that would give a higher mass, which would result in a higher energy.

Wait, no, because when you have a bound nucleus, the mass is less than the sum of individual nucleons.

Wait, let me compute that alternative approach.

Mass of ^6Li nucleus: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton:938.272 MeV/c².

Each neutron:939.565 MeV/c².

Total individual mass=3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass is 6.013 u *931.494 MeV/u =5601.0738 MeV.

So the mass is 5601.0738 MeV, which is less than the sum of individual nucleons because of binding energy.

So that approach won't change the calculation.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Based on the calculations, the energy is approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption that the speed is 0.96c. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem states that the speed is 0.96c, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value with the exact gamma.

Gamma =3.5714285714.

m c²=5.60107380683 GeV.

E=3.5714285714 *5.60107380683 = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator:

3.5714285714 ×5.60107380683.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.60107380683.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×0.60107380683.

0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.00107380683 ×3.5714285714≈0.003836.

So total is approximately 2.1428571428 +0.003836=2.146693.

Adding this to 17.857142857 gives 17.857142857 +2.146693=20.003835857 GeV.

So, again, about 20.0038 GeV.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV, but since the options don't have that, perhaps option C is the intended answer, possibly due to rounding in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise values.

Wait, v =0.96c.

v²/c²= (0.96)^2=0.9216.

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

Now, the square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

No mistake there.

Hmm, I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 20.004 GeV, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass. Let me compute m c² again.

Wait, 6.013 u ×931.494 MeV/u =5601.0738 MeV=5.6010738 GeV.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the product 3.5714285714 ×5.6010738 with more decimal places.

3.5714285714 ×5.6010738.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.6010738.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.6010738.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6=2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.0010738=0.003836.

Adding:2.14285714284 +0.003836=2.1466931428.

Adding to 17.857142857 gives 20.0038359998 GeV.

So approximately 20.0038 GeV.

Hmm. It seems that the correct answer is about 20 GeV, but the options don't have this. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the calculation to use gamma as 3.5714286, leading to E=20.0038 GeV, which rounds to 20.004 GeV. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the exact value of gamma as 3.5714286, and the exact value of m c² as 5.601074 GeV, leading to E=3.5714286 ×5.601074.

3.5714286 ×5.601074= ?

Let me compute this:

3.5714286 ×5 =17.857143.

3.5714286 ×0.601074.

Compute 0.6 ×3.5714286=2.14285716.

0.001074 ×3.5714286=0.003836.

Adding:2.14285716 +0.003836=2.14669316.

Adding to 17.857143 gives 20.003836 GeV.

So, again, same result.

I think that the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV, but perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV. Maybe due to rounding during intermediate steps or a miscalculation in the problem's options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using more precise gamma and m c².

Wait, let me compute gamma as 1/sqrt(0.0784) =3.5714285714285714.

m c²=6.013 ×931.494 MeV=5601.0738 MeV=5.6010738 GeV.

E=3.5714285714285714 ×5.6010738.

Let me compute this precisely:

3.5714285714285714 ×5.6010738.

Break it down:

3 ×5.6010738=16.8032214.

0.5714285714285714 ×5.6010738.

Compute 0.5 ×5.6010738=2.8005369.

0.0714285714285714 ×5.6010738=0.400079257.

Adding:2.8005369 +0.400079257=3.200616157.

Adding to 16.8032214 gives 20.003837557 GeV.

So, approximately 20.0038 GeV.

Hmm. Given all this, I think the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as 6 *938 MeV (approx), which would be higher.

Wait, 6 *938 MeV is 5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.628=2.241071428.

Total:20.09821428 GeV.

That's closer to option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem used an approximate mass of 6 *938 MeV.

But that approach is incorrect because the actual mass is lower due to binding energy.

But perhaps that's what the problem intended.

In that case, E=3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

3.57142857 ×5.628 = let's compute.

5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.628 ×3.57142857.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.028 ×3.57142857=0.09999999996.

Adding:2.142857142 +0.09999999996≈2.242857142.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.1 GeV.

So that would give option C:20.132 GeV.

But this approach uses an incorrect mass assumption.

I think that the correct approach is to use the correct mass, leading to approximately 20 GeV, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The nucleus in question is Lithium-6 (^6Li), which has a mass of 6.013 atomic mass units (u). The total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Substituting into the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Convert the nucleus mass to energy
The rest mass energy \( m c^2 \) is calculated using the atomic mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \), which is 6.013 u. Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.013 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5601.07 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- \( 3 \times 5.6011 = 16.8033 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.6011 \approx 3.2006 \, \text{GeV} \)

Adding these together:

\[
E \approx 16.8033 + 3.2006 = 20.0039 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0039 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, likely due to rounding differences or slight variations in intermediate steps.

ANSWER: C
