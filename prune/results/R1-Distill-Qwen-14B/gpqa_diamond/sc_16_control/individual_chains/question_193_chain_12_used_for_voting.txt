Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again: "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" The options are A to D, each suggesting a different power law relationship with distance r.

Hmm. Parallax is something I remember is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth, and it's inversely proportional to the distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, I think the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 AU divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So distance d is inversely proportional to parallax plx. So d = 1/plx.

The question says the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's calculate that exponent. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5, because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, I think that means the number of stars per unit distance, or the density. Wait, not necessarily density. Let me think about it. The number of stars in a region might be a function of distance. For example, as you go farther away, more stars might become visible, or fewer, depending on how they're distributed.

Wait, the way the question is phrased, is it N as a function of plx, which is inversely proportional to distance. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substitute: N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to the fifth power of distance.

But the question is asking how the number changes with distance. Wait, wait, per unit range of distance, r. Oh, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number density. Let me think. If the number of stars in a region depends on distance, perhaps considering a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4π r² dr. If the number of stars in each shell depends on r, then N(r) dr ∝ something.

Wait, let me step back. The problem says that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range—so perhaps the rate of change of N with respect to r. Or maybe it's about the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to model this.

If the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. Then, the number of stars as a function of distance is proportional to r^5. So, as r increases, N increases rapidly.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So the rate of change would be the derivative dN/dr. Let's compute that.

N = k r^5.

dN/dr = 5k r^4.

So the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options given are about how the number changes, perhaps the function of N with r. Or is the question about the number per unit distance? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm. Maybe it's asking for the number of stars per unit distance, which would be N per dr.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then per unit distance, it's N/dr = (k r^5)/(dr). Wait, no, that's not right. If you have a number of stars N within a certain volume, and you want the number per unit distance, perhaps that's the surface density or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at radius r. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to (4π r² dr) * (some density function). But in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Wait, maybe that's the number per unit volume or something else. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. The number of stars in a direction varies as 1/plx^5. So for a given direction (i.e., along a line of sight), the number of stars you see depends on parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the number of stars in that direction is highest when the parallax is smallest, which is when the distance is largest. So as you look farther away, more stars appear in that line of sight.

Wait, but the question is about a region of the sky, so perhaps it's considering a three-dimensional volume. Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a volume would be proportional to the volume times some density. But in this case, the density isn't uniform. From the problem, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5.

Wait, perhaps for each line of sight, the number of stars you see at a distance d is proportional to d^5. So for a given solid angle, the number of stars would be the integral along the line of sight. But wait, that's getting complicated. Let's think more carefully.

Suppose that N is the number of stars in a region of the sky with parallax plx. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

So for a given distance d, the number of stars in that region is proportional to d^5. Now, the question is about how the number changes with distance—specifically, per unit range of distance r. So perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, if N(r) = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4, and option B is r^5.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., stars per parsec) is N(r) = k r^5, but the rate at which stars appear as you move a distance dr is dN = (dN/dr) dr = 5k r^4 dr. So in this case, the number per unit distance is 5k r^4, which is proportional to r^4.

So then the correct answer would be option C, which is ~r^4.

Wait, but another way to think about this: the number of stars in a volume. The volume between r and r+dr is 4π r² dr. If the density of stars (stars per volume) is proportional to something, then the number of stars in that volume would be density * volume.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So maybe the number of stars in a certain region (like a sphere) of radius r is proportional to r^5. Then, the number of stars in a shell dr thick would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4. So that would suggest that the change in N per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the options are:

A) ~r^3

B) ~r^5

C) ~r^4

D) ~r^2

So the correct answer would be option C, r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \) (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as the distance increases, following a power law \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Starting with \( N = k r^5 \), where \( k \) is a proportionality constant, the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = 5k r^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \) as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
