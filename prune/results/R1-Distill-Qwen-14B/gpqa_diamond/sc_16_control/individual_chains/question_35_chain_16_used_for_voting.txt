Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. From what I remember, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are crucial in quantum mechanics because they represent the possible measurable values and the states associated with them.

So, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Matrix S has the form:

First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0

Hmm, I think matrix S looks like a Pauli matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used in quantum mechanics to represent spin-½ particles. There are three Pauli matrices (like S_x, S_y, S_z), and they have specific forms. Let me recall. Oh, wait, S here might be similar to the Pauli matrix σ_y. Because the standard σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, S is the same as σ_y.

So, the operator Ay is c times σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), that would make Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, but wait. The intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon (which is a lepton, like an electron but heavier) would be similar to the spin operator for spin-½ particles. So, the spin matrices are S_x, S_y, S_z, each with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But wait, the given c here is h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/(2π) because h = 2πħ. Oh, because h is Planck's constant, ħ is h/(2π). So c = (h)/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/(2). 

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Wait, but when you have the spin matrices, S_y is represented as σ_y multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because the spin angular momentum operator S (like S_x, S_y, S_z) are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So for example, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So in this case, Ay is just S_y, because Ay = c * σ_y = (ħ/2) σ_y = S_y.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, Ay is given as c multiplied by S, and S is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh, so S here is the same as σ_y. So, Ay is (h/(4π)) * σ_y. Let me compute that. Let's see, h/(4π) is the same as (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So, yes, Ay is (ħ/2) σ_y, which is exactly the spin operator S_y.

So the operator Ay is S_y. Now, the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ.

For a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component operators are ± ħ/2. So for S_y, the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. But wait, in this case, Ay is S_y. So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any options that match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's compute it ourselves. Let me write out the matrix Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is the same as (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -iħ/2 ],
  [iħ/2, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ [ -a, -iħ/2 ],
  [ iħ/2, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = a² - ( (-i)(i) (ħ²/4) )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (i^2) which is -1. So (-i)(i) = -i² = -( -1 ) = 1? Wait, no. Wait: Let me compute (-i)*(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (1)(ħ²/4) = 0.

So the equation is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0 => a² = ħ²/4 => a = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So in terms of h, since ħ = h/(2π), this becomes ± h/(4π) * (1/2) * 2? Wait, wait no. Let me think: ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait no: ħ/2 is (h/(2π))/2 = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π), but let's confirm.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So yes, eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So looking at the options, let's see which ones match.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ± h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues are real, right? Because S_y is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues must be real. So options A and B are talking about complex eigenvalues, which can't be right. So options A and B are probably incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think about that. The operator A is the spin operator, so Ay is S_y. The eigenfunctions of Sy would be the eigenstates of S² and Sy. Wait, no: S² is the square of the spin operator, and its eigenvalues are s(s+1)ħ², where s=1/2. So s(s+1) is 3/4, so eigenvalue is 3/4 ħ². So if a state is an eigenstate of Sy, then it's also an eigenstate of S². Because S² commutes with all components of S, including Sy. So any eigenstate of Sy is also an eigenstate of S². So for the operator Ay (which is Sy), the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A². So, the first part of option C is correct: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A².

But what about Az? Az is S_z. If a state is an eigenstate of Sy, will it be an eigenstate of Sz? Hmm, generally, no. Because Sy and Sz don't commute. So the eigenstates of Sy are not eigenstates of Sz. So the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of a 2x2 matrix would typically refer to the eigenvectors. But the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors (up to scaling). So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are indeed the basis functions of Ay. So option D could be correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to consider each option and see which is correct.

So let me reevaluate the options.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh. No, because eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Again, eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is h/(4π). So real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), imaginary parts zero. So B is wrong.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As discussed earlier, this is correct. Because states with definite Sy are also in definite S² (since S² commutes with all S_i) but not in definite Sz.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, any 2x2 matrix can be diagonalized with its eigenvectors as basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but D says "the eigenfunctions φ ... are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay". I'm not entirely sure about the phrasing, but in linear algebra terms, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis for the vector space, so D is correct.

So both options C and D seem possibly correct. But I need to find which one is correct according to the question.

Wait, the question is about the statements that are correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

So, for option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A² is the square of the operator A. But wait, in the question, A is the operator whose Y-component is Ay. So in this context, A would be the total angular momentum vector. But wait, wait, no. In the question, the operator is Ay, which is the Y-component. So the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So A² would be the square of the total angular momentum, which is S² for a spin-½ particle.

So for a spin-½ particle, any state that is an eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². Because S² commutes with all components. So yes, the eigenfunctions of S_y (which is Ay) are eigenfunctions of S². So C's first part is correct.

The second part of C says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Az is S_z. Since S_y and S_z don't commute, their eigenstates are different. So a state that is an eigenstate of S_y won't be an eigenstate of S_z. So C's statement is correct.

So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the matrix Ay is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (since it's diagonalizable, assuming distinct eigenvalues, which it is because ± h/(4π) are distinct). So D is also correct.

Wait, but wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps both statements C and D are correct, but looking at the options, I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as four choices, and only one is correct.

Let me think again.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's evaluate each option based on the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

As I've reasoned, this is correct because S² commutes with S_y, so any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². So the first part is correct. The second part is correct because S_y and S_z don't commute, so an eigenstate of S_y cannot be an eigenstate of S_z. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

The basis functions of the matrix operator Ay would be its eigenvectors, which form a basis for the two-dimensional space. So this is correct. So D is also a correct statement.

Wait, but the options are only one correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are presented as mutually exclusive.

Alternatively, perhaps one is correct and the others aren't.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct.

So with both options C and D being possibly correct, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the eigenvectors of Ay. Since Ay is S_y, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction.

So for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvectors of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of the |+z> and |-z> states.

But in terms of the matrix representation, the eigenvectors are the basis for the space, so D's statement is correct.

So, options C and D both seem correct, but perhaps that's not possible because the options are given as single choice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: The eigenvalues are complex with imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/4π. No, because the eigenvalues are real, as I computed earlier.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No, because the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which is a real number. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is S², and the eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S², this is correct. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, this is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but that would mean two options are correct, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay (S_y) are not eigenfunctions of Az, so that part is correct. But the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of S², so the first part of C is correct. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmm, but perhaps the question is asking which statement is correct, rather than which are correct. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps during the calculation, you don't consider the statement in C as correct. Let me think again about option C.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay could be eigenfunctions of A² because A² is S², which commutes with S_y. So any eigenstate of S_y is an eigenstate of S². So C's first part is correct.

The second part says they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct, as S_y and S_z don't commute.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the possible answers.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

If I have eigenvalues a=± h/(4π), which is real. So options A and B are incorrect because their eigenvalues are complex.

So only options C and D are possible.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which one is correct.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of S_y are indeed eigenfunctions of S^2, because S^2 commutes with S_y. So C's statement is correct.

D's statement is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space.

Wait, perhaps all 2x2 matrices have eigenvectors that form a basis, provided the matrix is diagonalizable. Since Ay is S_y, which is Hermitian, it's diagonalizable, so its eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct statements.

But the problem presents four options, and only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the operator Ay is not Hermitian? Wait, S is σ_y, which is Hermitian. So c is a real constant, so Ay is Hermitian. So eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the eigenvalues are a. So the eigenvalues are real.

So, looking again, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because D is trivially correct but perhaps the statement is not accurate.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. I think that's correct because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are the basis for the space. So D is correct.

But why would both C and D be correct? That can't be the case in the problem's options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and D are both correct, but the given options only have one correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the matrix representation. The matrix Ay is 2x2, and its eigenvectors are the basis for the space. So D is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct regarding the calculation. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator in the sense that the matrix's eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator, but that seems correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which is real. So options A and B are out.

Which leaves C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Yes, because the eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S², but not of S_z.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct, but the options can't both be right. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the problem is about which statement is correct, so perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the problem says that the matrix S is given, and Ay is c·S.

But wait, perhaps the matrix S is not the Pauli matrix. Wait, S has the first row as (0, -i), second as (i, 0). Which is exactly σ_y. So in that case, Ay is c * σ_y. So yes, it's S_y.

But what about the matrix representation of S in the given basis? So perhaps the basis is different, but that doesn't change the fact that the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the option D is incorrect because the operator Ay's eigenfunctions are the basis functions, but perhaps the matrix represents the operator in another basis. Hmm, no. The standard basis is the computational basis, and the eigenvectors of Ay are in that space.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is trying to say that the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the operator, which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's correct.

In any case, the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are wrong.

Between C and D, which is correct.

The problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, during the calculation, when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² = S², which commutes with Sy, so eigenstates of Sy are eigenstates of S², but not of Sz.

So both C and D are correct, but perhaps only one is an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: perhaps the question is about the possible statements during the calculation. For example, which of these statements is correct during finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, during the calculation:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

This is a correct statement, so during the calculation, you would realize that. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That is correct.

So both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the matrix form of Ay is given, and the eigenvectors are the basis functions for that matrix, which is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the correct answer as option C. Because the problem is about a multiple-choice question, and perhaps only one option is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So this would be correct.

So, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \). Therefore, \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \sigma_y \), which is equivalent to the spin operator \( S_y \) for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle. The eigenvalues of \( S_y \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \). Substituting \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Claims that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), as \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator.

2. **Option B**: Claims that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real and do not match the values stated in this option.

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of the angular momentum operator). This is correct because:
   - \( A^2 \) corresponds to \( S^2 \), which commutes with \( S_y \). Therefore, any eigenstate of \( S_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( S^2 \).
   - \( A_z \) corresponds to \( S_z \), and \( S_y \) does not commute with \( S_z \). Hence, eigenstates of \( S_y \) are not eigenstates of \( S_z \).

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space of the operator.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct based on the reasoning above. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct statement, **option C** is the most relevant during the calculation, as it highlights the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is a key aspect of the problem.

**Answer: C**
