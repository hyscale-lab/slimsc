Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Hmm.

So, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P^2⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to find both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I'm not sure if it's also an eigenstate of P_z. Probably not, because P_x and P_z don't commute. So the uncertainty in P_z would be non-zero.

First, I should write down the matrix for P_z. Let me look at the problem again. The matrix for P_z has first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So the matrix is diagonal, which makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the eigenstates are |z+⟩, |z0⟩, and |z-⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

The state vector given is a column vector: ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Wait, but wait. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just P_z squared, because each diagonal element is just squared. So let's compute these expectation values.

First, the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩. That's the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Wait, no, because when the state is written in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component is the amplitude of that eigenstate.

Wait, if the basis is |z+⟩, |z0⟩, |z-⟩, then the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these. So the components are c_+, c_0, c_-.

In this case, |ψ⟩ is (-1/2)|z+⟩ + (1/√2)|z0⟩ + (-1/2)|z-⟩.

So, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = |c_+|^2 * ħ + |c_0|^2 * 0 + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ).

Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be |c_+|^2 * ħ² + |c_0|^2 * 0 + |c_-|^2 * ħ².

So let's compute the coefficients first.

The given vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So c_+ = -1/2, c_0 = 1/√2, c_- = -1/2.

Compute |c_+|²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c_0|²: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c_-|²: (1/2)^2= 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) (ħ^2) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ^2) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0² ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait a second, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). But let's double-check because sometimes I mix up the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me calculate again.

The state |ψ⟩ is given as a column vector. So when it's expressed in the P_z basis, the components are already the amplitudes for each eigenstate. So yes, the approach is correct.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, and ⟨P_z²⟩ is ½ ħ². So the variance is ½ ħ², so the uncertainty is sqrt(½) ħ, which is ħ/sqrt(2).

Looking back at the options, that's option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $|\psi\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state $|\psi\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of $P_z$:
\[
|\psi\rangle = c_+ |z_+\rangle + c_0 |z_0\rangle + c_- |z_-\rangle,
\]
where the coefficients are $c_+ = -1/2$, $c_0 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_- = -1/2$. The expectation value of $P_z$ is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_0|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_-|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]
Calculating the squared coefficients:
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_0|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Substituting these into the formula for $\langle P_z \rangle$:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, so its eigenvalues are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$:
\[
P_z^2 = \hbar^2, \quad P_z^2 = 0, \quad P_z^2 = \hbar^2.
\]
The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_0|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_-|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]
Substituting the squared coefficients:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
