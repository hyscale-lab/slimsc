Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles after a pion decays. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, no, actually, looking again, it's Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I think. So Pi(+) is stationary, and it's decaying into a muon and a neutrino. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? I remember that neutrinos are very light, but in particle physics, sometimes they're considered massless for these kinds of calculations, or their mass is negligible. So maybe I can treat the neutrino's rest mass as zero. Or perhaps the problem expects me to ignore it. I'll have to see.

So the question is about finding the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The options give different pairs, so I need to calculate both. 

First, I should probably write down the conservation laws. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That implies that the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Let me think about energy conservation as well. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is the rest mass energy of the muon plus its kinetic energy, and E_nu is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible. 

But wait, the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the decay products must equal that. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p as well, but in the opposite direction. 

So, the energy of the muon is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but since units are in MeV, probably c=1, so E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Similarly, E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + 0) = p, since the neutrino's mass is approximately zero. 

The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi^2. 

Wait, no. Actually, the initial energy is M_pi c^2, but since we're using units where c=1, it's just M_pi. So setting up the equation: 

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

We can solve for p. Let's plug in the numbers. M_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. 

So the equation is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) as A. Then A + p = 139.6. So A = 139.6 - p. 

Square both sides: p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p + p^2.

So, p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides: 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 *139.6 p.

So rearranging: 2 *139.6 p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2. Let me calculate:

139.6 squared: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, but perhaps using a calculator approach would be better. Alternatively, 139.6 *139.6:

Let me compute 139.6 *139.6:

139.6 * 100 = 13960

139.6 * 30 = 4188

139.6 * 9 = 1256.4 

139.6 * 0.6 = 83.76 

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, I can compute 139.6^2 as (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112=19488 +0.16=19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2. Let's compute 105^2 = 11025. Then 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11025+147=11172+0.49=11172.49.

So 139.6^2 = 19488.16, 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So the equation becomes:

2 *139.6 p = 19488.16 -11172.49.

Calculating the right-hand side: 19488.16 -11172.49. Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

19488 -11172 is 8316. Then 0.16 - 0.49 is -0.33. So 8315.84? Wait, wait: Hmm, wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16

-11172.49

First, subtract 11172 from 19488.16: 19488.16 -11172 = 8316.16.

Then subtract 0.49: 8316.16 - 0.49 = 8315.67.

So 2 *139.6 p =8315.67.

So 2 *139.6 =279.2.

So p =8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute that division.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me see: 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2: 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, wait, 29 *279.2 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 =8096.8. But that's 8096.8. Our numerator is 8315.67.

So 29 is about 8096.8, 30 would be 8376. So 8315.67 is between 29 and 30 times 279.2.

Let me compute 29.8 *279.2.

279.2 *0.8= 223.36.

279.2 *29= 8096.8 as before.

So 29.8 is 29 +0.8, so 8096.8 +223.36 =8320.16.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is higher than 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 is a bit too high. Let me compute 29.8 *279.2=8320.16.

So 8315.67 is 8320.16 -4.49 = 29.8 - (4.49/279.2).

4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.01607.

So p ≈29.8 -0.01607 ≈29.7839.

Wait, but 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 4.49 above 8315.67. So 279.2 * x =8315.67.

x = (8315.67)/(279.2) ≈ let me compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

We can approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8

So 8315.67 -8096.8= 218.87.

So 218.87 is 279.2 * (218.87/279.2) → 218.87/279.2 ≈0.782.

So total p≈29 +0.782≈29.782.

Wait, but wait, that's not right because 29 is 279.2 *29=8096.8, and the remaining 218.87 is 279.2 *0.782, so x=29.782.

So p≈29.782 MeV/c.

So the muon's momentum is about 29.78 MeV/c, and the neutrino's is the same, but in the opposite direction.

Now, the next step is to find the energies.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )=sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute each term:

29.78^2 ≈ (30 -0.22)^2=900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.0484= 900 -13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

105.7^2=11172.49 as before.

So sum is 886.8484 +11172.49 =12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384) ≈ let's see, 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher.

Wait, 110^2=12100. So 12059.3384 is 12100-40.6616= so sqrt is a little less than 110.

Let me compute 109.8^2: 109.8 *109.8.

109.8^2= (110 -0.2)^2=110^2 -2*110*0.2 +0.2^2=12100 - 44 +0.04=12056.04.

Hmm, 109.8^2=12056.04. Our value is 12059.3384, which is 3.2984 higher.

So 109.8^2=12056.04. 109.8 + x)^2 =12059.3384.

We can use linear approximation. Let me say f(x)= (109.8 +x)^2= 12056.04 + 2*109.8 x +x^2.

We set 12056.04 + 2*109.8 x ≈12059.3384.

So 2*109.8 x ≈3.2984 → 219.6 x ≈3.2984 → x≈3.2984 /219.6 ≈0.015.

So 109.8 +0.015=109.815. Let's square that.

Wait, maybe it's quicker to consider that 12056.04 is 109.8^2, and 12059.3384 is 3.2984 above that. So the square root is 109.8 + (3.2984)/(2*109.8) ) → 109.8 + 3.2984/(219.6) → 109.8 + 0.015 ≈109.815 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.815 MeV.

E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the initial total energy was 139.6 MeV, right? So E_mu + E_nu should be 139.6.

Let me check: 109.815 +29.78 =139.595 ≈139.6 MeV. Close enough, considering the approximations.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu. Because the rest energy is m_mu c^2, which is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = (E_mu) - (m_mu) = 109.815 -105.7 ≈4.115 MeV.

And the kinetic energy of the neutrino is E_nu, since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu =29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated. Option C has 3.52 and 20.8. So that's not matching. Option B:7.2,32.8. No. Option A:2.84,26.8.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I haven't made any mistakes. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p. Let me recheck.

The equation was 2*139.6 p =139.6^2 -105.7^2.

139.6^2 is 19488.16.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Subtracting: 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

So 2*139.6 =279.2.

p=8315.67 /279.2 → let me compute this division more accurately.

Calculating 8315.67 ÷ 279.2:

Well, 279.2 × 29.78 is roughly, but let's do it step by step.

How many times does 279.2 go into 8315.67?

279.2 *29= 8096.8.

Subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67 → 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

Now, 279.2 × x = 218.87. x=218.87 /279.2 ≈0.782.

So p=29.782 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt(29.782^2 +105.7^2 )= sqrt( 887.0 (approx) + 11172.49 )= sqrt(12059.49)≈109.815 MeV.

So KE_mu=109.815 -105.7=4.115 MeV. Rounded to 4.12 MeV.

KE_nu=29.78 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

So the pair is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches option D.

So the correct answer is option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, **π⁺**, into a muon, **μ⁺**, and a neutrino, **ν**, using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as:

- Rest mass of **π⁺**: \( M_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of **μ⁺**: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = M_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, \( E_{\nu} = p \), where \( p \) is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum. The muon's energy is given by:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]
Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = M_{\pi}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. This implies that the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p, \quad \text{but in opposite directions}.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Substitute \( M_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Let \( A = \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} \). Then:  
\[
A = 139.6 - p.
\]
Square both sides:  
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]
Cancel \( p^2 \) and rearrange:  
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]
\[
279.2p = 8315.67.
\]
Solve for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Muon's Energy**:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

2. **Neutrino's Energy**:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:  
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.815 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
