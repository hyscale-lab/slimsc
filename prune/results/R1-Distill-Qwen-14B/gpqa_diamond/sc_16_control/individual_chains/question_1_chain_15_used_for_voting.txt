Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! Which states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime (or rather, the time) of a particle with absolute precision. The principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (or lifetime), and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, so in this case, the lifetimes given are for each state. But I'm a bit confused. Each state has its own lifetime, but when considering the energy difference between them, how does that tie in?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy resolution needed. To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart; they'd look like a single state.

So for each state, the uncertainty ΔE is given by ħ divided by the lifetime τ. Because Δt is the lifetime here. So for E1, τ is 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. And for E2, τ is 1e-8, so ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Wait, but which ΔE matters here? Because we're looking at the energy difference between E2 and E1, which is ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, this ΔE should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty in each? Or maybe the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is the sum of the uncertainties from each state.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution required is based on the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy is only known within an uncertainty of ħ/τ. So if the energy difference between the two states is larger than the sum of these individual uncertainties, then we can distinguish them.

Wait, let's think differently. When you have two states, each with their own lifetimes, the combined uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to ensure that the energy difference between E1 and E2 is at least the order of the uncertainty given by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1, 1e-9 s) has a larger energy uncertainty. If the energy difference is much larger than this, then the two states can be resolved.

Wait, let me think about how the uncertainty principle applies to distinguishable states. Suppose each energy has a certain lifetime, so the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 and ΔE2. For two states to be distinguishable, their energies must be separated by more than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than that, the uncertainties would overlap, and you can't tell the two states apart.

So in formula terms, the condition for distinguishability would be |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

But wait, ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To make calculations easier, sometimes people use units where ħ is in eV·s. Let me think about the conversion.

Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, so ħ in eV·s is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Yeah, I remember that number because it's a common value used in these calculations.

So, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV. That's 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is approximately 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this sum. So let's see the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's way smaller than 7e-7. So no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV. Hmm. 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7, so that would satisfy the condition.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. Which is 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV. Wait, that's 1e-8 eV. Is that larger than the sum of the uncertainties?

Wait, no. The sum is about 7e-7 eV ≈ 7e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is larger than 7e-7.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the energy difference is E2 - E1. The question states that the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8. So for the energy difference to be resolved, the separation must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy, which is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime. Because the uncertainty is larger for the shorter-lived state.

Wait, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty given by the shorter lifetime. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, the two states can't be distinguished.

Wait, actually, the problem is to find the energy difference that would allow the two states to be clearly resolved. So the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let me recompute.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the maximum of the two is 6.582e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than 6.582e-7 eV for them to be clearly resolved.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4. 6.582e-7 is 0.0000006582 eV.

So 1e-4 is much larger than 6.58e-7. So that's good.

Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's way smaller than 6.58e-7, so no.

But wait, let me think again. Do we need the energy difference to be larger than the sum or the maximum of the two uncertainties?

I think the correct condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and the combined uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two. So, |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let's compute that sum again. ΔE1 is 6.582e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4 = 100e-6. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So 1e-4 is way bigger than 7.24e-7. So yes, that's sufficient.

So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, let me make sure. Is there any other factor I'm missing? Like, perhaps the energy difference is the same as the uncertainty in energy, so only larger than that?

Wait, no. The reasoning is that each state has a certain uncertainty in its energy. The energy difference between the two must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, so that when you measure, the energies don't overlap. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum, the measurements could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish.

So, with that in mind, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), given their lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the lifetime \( \tau \) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the condition for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). The states can be resolved.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) for the two states to be distinguishable. Among the options, only \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) satisfies this condition.
