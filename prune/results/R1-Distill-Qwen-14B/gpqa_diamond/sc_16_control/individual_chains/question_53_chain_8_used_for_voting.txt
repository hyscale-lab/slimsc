Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, so I'm thinking there's an R-O-CO-O-R group or maybe an ester as in RCOOR', right? Wait, no, esters are usually RCOOR', so the presence of an ester group would mean there's a carbonyl (C=O) which typically shows up around 1700 cm^-1 in IR. The question says the FTIR has peaks indicating an ester, so that's a key point.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me break them down. Two aromatic-H signals, so the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that cause different splitting. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two equivalent protons each (like in para-xylene). But wait, the substituents here might not be the same. Hmm, but the number of signals is two. So maybe the substituents are in positions that cause two different types of aromatic protons. Like if one substituent is in ortho and the other in meta, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a vic-dihydroxy structure or something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. Wait, but the aromatic protons are already accounted for, so perhaps the vinyl-Hs are from a substituent group, like an ester with a double bond, like an allyl group or maybe part of a substituent like a vinyl ester? Or maybe it's a substituent that's an ester with a double bond nearby, like an acrylate group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let me think: a doublet might be a proton adjacent to another proton, maybe in a CH2-CH2 group, but the other is a doublet of quartets. That sounds a bit more complex. Alternatively, the vinyl protons could be part of an ester substituent. For example, if there's a group like O-CO-O-R, where R has a double bond. Wait, esters can have substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituents themselves are vinyl groups attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, the aromatic ring is substituted with two groups. Let's think: each substituent could be an ester group. But wait, esters would have more oxygen and other groups. Alternatively, one substituent could be an ester, and the other something else. But the key is to find out the structure based on the NMR.

Then there are two signals for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups. So the compound has two methyl groups but no methylene (CH2) groups. That suggests that any substituents might have methyl groups attached directly, like in an ester where the R group is something like Me (methyl). For example, an ester group like -O-CO-OCH3 or something similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituents on the benzene ring are an ester and another group. Let me think: benzene with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, and maybe the other is a vinyl group or another substituent that brings in a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are a methyl ester and another group that has vinyl protons. Or perhaps the substituents themselves contain the ester group and some vinyl structure.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two groups attached. Let's think about what each substituent contributes.

Option 1: One substituent is a methyl ester, like OMe (but that's an ether, not an ester). Wait, no, an ester would be O-CO-O-R, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, no. Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if one substituent is an ester group, like an acetyl group or something.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 or something like that. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. For example, an ester could be part of a substituent like CH2CH2COOCH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with two substituents: one being a methyl ester (like -O-CO-OCH3) and the other being a vinyl group. But wait, that would complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group, but that might not align with the NMR data.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic protons are split into two signals. So maybe the substituents are in positions that cause different environments for the aromatic Hs. For example, if one substituent is para and the other is para relative to the first, but that would need a specific arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester and another methyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit with the vinyl protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not on the ring but part of a side chain, like an ester group attached via an oxygen to the ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with two ester groups, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group attached as a substituent. For example, substituents could be -O-CO-OCH3 and -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents are both part of an ester group, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group with a vinyl chain.

Wait, another approach: let's count the hydrogens. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

So the options are varying in C and H. Let's see, the compound is a di-substituted benzene, which has 6 carbons from the ring. So the substituents add more carbons.

Suppose each substituent is an ester group. Wait, but an ester is R-O-CO-R', so if each substituent is an ester, that might be more carbons than needed. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. Let me think: if the substituents are a methyl ester (like -O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group (like -CH2CH2-), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two aromatic H signals. For a di-substituted benzene, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. If the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-xylene, there are two types of H: the two Hs adjacent to each substituent, which are equivalent, and the other two Hs which are also equivalent but different from the first two. So that would give two signals. So if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic H would split into two signals, each integrating for two H each (if each substituent is a single substituent). That fits with the NMR data.

So substituents are para to each other on the benzene ring.

Now, the other signals: two vinyl-H signals. So each vinyl group has its own set of Hs. The NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let's think about a vinyl group connected to an ester. For example, consider a substituent like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene. But wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) connected to an ester group.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl ester. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a group that brings in the ester and the vinyl protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group.

Wait, but the ester group can't be a substituent in itself. Wait, perhaps an ester group is attached via an oxygen, like -O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a vinyl group connected to an ester. Wait, that's getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is an ester group, but that would require each substituent to have an ester group, which might add more oxygens than needed. Wait, the formula options have two oxygens. So the molecular formula must have two oxygen atoms.

Wait, the molecular formula includes O2. So perhaps the substituents are an ester group (which is O2) and another group that doesn't add more O.

Hmm, but the substituents can't contribute more O because the formula has two. So each substituent must be O-free except for the ester.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so perhaps two methyl groups. Let me think: if one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-OCH3) which would contribute a methyl group, and another substituent is a methyl group (-OCH3, but that's an ether). Wait, but the ester substituent would have a methyl group (like in methyl ester), and maybe another substituent is a methyl group attached directly to the benzene.

Wait, but that would require two methyl groups on the benzene, but if the substituents are para, then the two methyl groups would be para to each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic Hs. But wait, in such a case, the aromatic Hs would be in two environments: the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents. So that could account for the two aromatic H signals.

But then, where do the vinyl Hs come in? Because the NMR has two vinyl H signals. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group (-CH3) and the other substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, substituent A is -CH3, substituent B is -(CH2) group or something else. Wait, but that may not contribute the vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is part of a vinyl group. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a vinyl ester. For example, substituent A is -O-CO-OCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group) and substituent B is -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond. For example, substituent could be a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring. But then, how would that affect the NMR?

Wait, let's try to think of a specific structure. Let's say the benzene has two substituents: one is a methyl group and the other is an ester group that includes a vinyl group.

But perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a vinyl ester group. For example, substituent A is -O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 and substituent B is -CH3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are both ester groups, each contributing O2. But that would make the formula have more O atoms than allowed, as the formula is O2. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester group (O2) and the other is a vinyl group (no O). Then the formula would have O2, as needed.

So substituent A: an ester group, like O-CO-OCH3 (which would be a methyl ester). Substituent B: a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But wait, vinyl groups usually are CH2=CH2 or similar, but as substituents on benzene, they would be attached via a single bond. So substituent B could be -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that's getting more complex.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a vinyl group attached to the ring, such as -CH2CH2- but that's single bonds. Or maybe a group like -CH2CH2COOCH3, which would have a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that might not have a double bond. Alternatively, the substituent could be -CH2CH2COOCH3, which is an ethyl ester, but no double bonds.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -CH2CH2COOCH3 with a double bond between the first two CH2 groups. No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester, like -O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methacrylate group, which would have a double bond. For example, substituent could be -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let's think about what that implies.

A doublet suggests that a proton has one neighboring proton. For vinyl protons, each is split by the neighboring one. So in a CH2-CH2 group, each CH2 would be a quartet because each H is split by two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but a doublet would imply each H has only one neighbor. So perhaps it's part of a CH2-CH2 group where one of the CH2 is adjacent to another group.

Alternatively, it could be part of a CH=CH group. For example, in a vinyl group like CH2=CH-, the two protons on each CH are split into doublets. But then, in the case of a trans or cis arrangement, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, the two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let me think about a structure where one vinyl H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another group. For example, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3 group attached to the benzene ring. Then, the H on the CH2 next to O would split into a quartet due to coupling with the CH2 group, and the H on the other CH2 would be a quartet as well, but wait, the NMR shows one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a CH2-CH2 group attached to an oxygen, such as an ether or ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene.

In that case, the vinyl group would have two types of Hs: the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the O, and the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, the structure would be something like benzene-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, a vinyl group has a double bond.

Oh, right, wait. So substituent B in the benzene could be an ester group attached via a vinyl group. For example, substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl ester, no double bonds. Alternatively, substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, that would make the structure benzene with two substituents: one methyl group and one vinyl ester group.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR signals. The vinyl Hs would be on the CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 substituent.

In that case, the CH2=CH-O- group would have two sets of Hs. The H on the CH2 would be next to the double bond, and the H on the adjacent CH would be part of the double bond.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 attached to benzene. So the substituent is a vinyl ester.

In such a structure, the vinyl protons (on the CH2=CH-O-) would have a specific splitting. The H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH that's part of the double bond, leading to coupling.

So for the CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, right? But wait, in a vinyl group, the two Hs are on the same CH2, and each is split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3.

So, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring as O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, so the group is O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester attached via a vinyl group. Like substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's just a longer alkyl chain, not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of a simpler structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a methyl ester, and the other is a vinyl group.

Wait, but how would the NMR look in that case?

If substituent A is -O-CO-OCH3 (a methyl ester group), and substituent B is -CH2CH2- attached to the ring. But that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2CH2COOCH3, which is an ethyl ester but without a double bond. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group, like -CH2CH2- attached via a double bond. No, the substituent would have to be attached via a single bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the ring. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part.

In this case, the substituent would contribute two vinyl protons. The CH2=CH- would have two Hs. Let's say the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-OCH3 (for substituent A) and benzene-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3 (but that's not a vinyl group). Alternatively, substituent B is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that might not be possible. Let me think of the structure: benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that's not a vinyl, it's an ethyl ester.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a pentyl ester, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider the molecular formula options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The parent ring is benzene, which has 6 carbons. So the substituents add more carbons.

Each substituent contributes some carbons. For example, if one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), that's 3 carbons (the methyl). If the other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), that's 2 carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 2 (vinyl) = 11? But that's 11 C, so the formula would be C11HxO2.

Wait, the substituents would add more H as well. Let me count.

Methyl ester group: O-CO-OCH3 adds 3 C and 3 H (from the methyl).

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- adds 2 C and 2 H (assuming it's -CH2CH2-? No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group which would be a CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the H on the CH2 would be 2 H, and on the CH (part of the double bond) would be 1 H. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (-O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl ester (-O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups, but that would require more O atoms than allowed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, each substituent is a methyl group and an ester group with a vinyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with substituents: -O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) and -CH2CH2COOCH3 (ethyl ester). But that would have more oxygen than allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group, and the other is a vinyl ester group.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is -O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) and substituent B is -CH2CH2COOCH3 (ethyl ester). No, that would be two ester groups, which would require four oxygen atoms. But the formula has only two O, so that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a propenoate ester group.

Wait, the propenoate ester would be something like -CH2-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's not a vinyl group.

Alternatively, substituent B is a propenoate ester, like -CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the first two CH2 groups. So it would be -CH2-CH2-C=O-OCH3, but that's not correct because the ester functional group is O-CO-O.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl ester, like -CH2-CH2-C=O-OCH3, but that's not right. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try a different approach. The molecular formula options have either 11 or 12 carbons and varying H counts.

The benzene ring contributes 6 C. Let's see how the substituents add up.

Option D is C11H12O2. So substituents would add 5 more C. So substituents could be a methyl group (1 C) and a butyl ester (4 C). But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So R would contribute to the carbons. For example, if R is a methyl group, the ester is O-CO-OCH3, which adds 3 C (the O, CO, and OCH3). Wait, no, the O-CO-O is part of the ester, but R is the alkyl part. So for R as methyl, the ester is O-CO-OCH3, which contributes 3 C (the methyl). If substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C), substituent B is maybe a CH2CH2 group? Not sure.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C) and substituent B is a vinyl group, which is 2 C. So total substituents would be 5 C, making the formula C11HxO2.

Wait, the molecular formula options have 11 or 12 C. So substituents add 5 or 6 C.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group and an ester group that includes a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a methyl group (-CH3, 1 C), and substituent B is an ester group with a vinyl substituent. For example, substituent B could be -O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl ester), which adds 3 C. But that doesn't include a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl ester, like -O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's longer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the H count.

The total H in the options varies: H12, H14, etc.

The aromatic ring itself has 6 H in benzene, but with two substituents, the H count reduces. For example, if substituents are in para positions, then each substituent would take away two H, so 6 - 4 = 2 H on the ring. Wait, no, benzene has six H. Each substituent (if ortho, meta, para) would occupy certain positions.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs. Each substituent would cause two H to be deshielded, but I'm not exactly sure about the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such positions that there are two distinct aromatic H environments, each with two H. So two signals each integrating for two H.

Assuming that, the aromatic Hs contribute 4 H in total. Then, the other signals: two vinyl Hs (say 2 H), and two CH3 groups (say 6 H, since each CH3 is 3 H, and two CH3 groups would be 6 H). Wait, but the NMR has two signals for CH3, so each CH3 is in a different environment.

Wait, but in the NMR, two signals for CH3: so two different CH3 groups. Each would have 3 H, so 6 H in total from CH3.

The vinyl Hs: two signals. Suppose each is 2 H, so 4 H. But wait, the NMR says two signals for vinyl Hs, each could be 2 H, so 4 H.

Aromatic Hs: 4 H (two signals each 2 H).

Plus CH3: 6 H.

So total H from these groups would be 4 + 4 +6 =14 H.

But the molecular formula options have H counts of 12, 14, etc.

Wait, but the options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H

B) C12H14O2 → 14 H

C) C12H12O2 →12 H

D) C11H12O2 →12 H

So if the total H from aromatic, vinyl, and CH3 is 14, the molecular formula would have H14. So looking at the options, options A and B have H14.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing some H. Because the substituents might have more H elsewhere.

Wait, the substituent groups might have more H. For example, the ester group may contribute more H.

Let me think again: the substituent is an ester group, which would be O-CO-O-R. The R group could be a methyl group, so the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 C and 3 H (from CH3).

If the other substituent is a vinyl group, say -CH2-CH2-, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2CH2COOCH3, which is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propenoate ester. So substituent B is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group, like -CH2-CH2- attached to the ring, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, like -CH2-CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: The NMR shows no CH2 signals, only CH3 and aromatic, and vinyl. So substituents don't have any CH2 groups. So substituents could be CH3 groups or groups without CH2.

Wait, but each substituent is either a CH3 or a group without CH2. For example, an ester group with a methyl (CH3) would fit, and perhaps another substituent that's a CH3 group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents, each being a methyl ester. So substituents would be O-CO-OCH3 groups. But that would require more O.

Wait, each O-CO-OCH3 group contributes two O, but the formula has O2. So that's not possible because two substituents would contribute 4 O, which is more than allowed.

So that's not possible. So one substituent must be an ester, contributing two O, and the other substituent must be something else that doesn't contribute O.

So substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 (2 O), substituent B: something else (like a methyl group), which doesn't add O.

So substituent B is a methyl group, -CH3.

So now, the structure is benzene with two substituents: O-CO-OCH3 and CH3, para to each other.

But wait, that would give the aromatic Hs as two signals (each integrating for 2 H), the ester's CH3 (3 H), and the substituent's CH3 (3 H). But where do the vinyl Hs come into play?

Wait, in this structure, there are no vinyl Hs. So the NMR would not show any vinyl H signals, which contradicts the given data. Therefore, this structure is incorrect.

Hmm. So substituent B must contribute vinyl Hs. So substituent B must have a vinyl group.

So substituent A is O-CO-OCH3, substituent B is a group with a vinyl.

But substituent B can't contribute O, because the formula only has O2. So substituent B must be a vinyl group attached to the ring, without any O.

Wait, but how? Because if substituent B is a vinyl group, it would be something like -CH2-CH2-, but that's not a vinyl. A vinyl group is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, like -CH2=CH-.

Wait, substituent B being a vinyl group would be attached to the ring as -CH2=CH-. But that would require the substituent to have a double bond. So substituent B is a vinyl group, like -CH2=CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that's a substituent with a double bond. So the structure would have a benzene ring with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH2.

But that's just a guess. Let me see what the NMR would look like.

The aromatic Hs would be in two environments (para substituents), giving two signals.

The substituent B (CH2=CH2) would have two sets of Hs: the CH2 on either side of the double bond. The Hs on CH2 would each be split by the adjacent CH.

But in reality, for a vinyl group like CH2=CH-, the two Hs on each CH would couple with each other, leading to a doublet for each CH.

Wait, for example, in a CH2=CH- group, each CH has one H, so each would be a triplet? No, wait, in a vinyl group, the two Hs on each CH are equivalent, and each is split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, no, the structure would be CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. So the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, which has one H. So each H on the CH2 would be split by the H on the CH. So each H on the CH2 would be a doublet. Similarly, the H on the CH would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, making it a triplet.

But in the NMR, the problem states two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

So perhaps substituent B is a longer chain. Let's say substituent B is an allyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-. But that's a possibility.

Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. No, that brings in another O.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl ester, but that would require more O.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, and the other a doublet of quartets. This suggests that one of the vinyl Hs is coupled with one neighbor (doublet), and the other is coupled with two sets of neighbors, leading to a quartet, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent that's an ester. For example, substituent B is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's an ethyl ester without a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propenoate ester. So substituent B is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. That would add more carbons and a vinyl group.

In this case, substituent B would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 attached to the benzene.

Then, the H on the CH2 group adjacent to the ester would be split by the adjacent CH=CH2 group. Let me think about the splitting.

The CH2 group attached to the ester (O-CO-O-CH2-) would have two Hs. Each H on this CH2 would be adjacent to the CH=CH2 group, which has two Hs on the double bond.

Wait, but in reality, the CH2 group would be next to a CH group with a double bond. So the Hs on the CH2 would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH.

For example, the CH2 would be -O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. The Hs on the CH2 would each be adjacent to the CH=CH2 group. The CH=CH2 group would have Hs on the double bond.

So the Hs on the CH2 would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH, leading to a quartet (each H on CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH, but I'm not sure about the exact splitting.

Alternatively, the Hs on the CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH, but I'm not certain.

The Hs on the CH=CH2 group would each be split by the adjacent CH2, leading to a doublet. Each H on the CH would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, that would make the Hs on the CH=CH2 group a doublet of triplets or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck.

But according to the NMR data, one vinyl H is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's an ester and not a vinyl group. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group with a double bond and a methyl ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents:

1. O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester, contributing 3 C and 3 H)

2. CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 (vinyl ester, contributing more C and H)

But wait, that would add more O than allowed. O-CO-O (ester) is two O, and another O would come from the vinyl group, making it O3, which isn't allowed.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think about the molecular formula.

If the molecular formula is C11H14O2 (option A), the degrees of unsaturation can be calculated.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*11 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

Which could correspond to benzene (3 degrees), one ester group (maybe a double bond), and another double bond in a vinyl group.

Wait, benzene has 3 degrees (from the ring), the ester has a carbonyl (another degree), and the vinyl group has a double bond (another degree). So that's 5 degrees total.

So that fits with option A (C11H14O2). Option B is C12H14O2, which would have degrees of unsaturation (2*12+2-14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. That would mean an additional degree of unsaturation, perhaps another ring or double bond.

But let's consider option A: C11H14O2.

So, substituents would add 5 C (since benzene is 6 C, 6 +5=11). So substituents add 5 C.

But substituent A (ester) is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 C (COOCH3 is 3 C: the COO has one C from the carbonyl, and the OCH3 is another C). So substituent A: 3 C. Substituent B would need to add 2 C, but that may not make sense. Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group (2 C), but then substituent A would have 3 C, so total substituents add 5 C, which fits.

So substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C), substituent B: CH2=CH- (2 C). So substituents add 5 C.

So the structure would have substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, then the CH2=CH- group would have some Hs. Let's see: the substituent is CH2=CH- attached to benzene. So the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH which is part of the double bond.

So the Hs on the CH2 would each be next to the CH, leading to each being a doublet. The H on the CH would be next to the CH2, so each would be a quartet.

Wait, but the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the CH2 Hs are a doublet, and the CH Hs are a quartet? Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain with a double bond, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3 attached to the ring.

Wait, but that's more complicated. Let me count the carbons:

Benzene: 6 C.

Substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 → 3 C (COOCH3).

Substituent B: CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3 → 5 C. Wait, that's getting to 6 +3 +5 =14 C, which is beyond the options.

Hmm. Another approach: let's look for a structure where the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, and the molecular formula is C11H14O2.

So substituents add 5 C. So substituent A is 3 C (ester), substituent B is 2 C (vinyl).

So substituent B is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-.

Then, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-OCH3 and benzene-CH2=CH-.

But wait, that would have two substituents, both attached to the benzene, which is di-substituted.

But then, the substituents would be in para positions, leading to two aromatic H signals.

Then, the CH2=CH- substituent would have two Hs on the CH2 (each a doublet) and two Hs on the CH (each a quartet? Or something else).

Wait, but in this structure, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached directly to the benzene. So the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, which is part of the double bond.

So each H on the CH2 would be split by the H on the CH, leading to a doublet for each. The H on the CH would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But according to the NMR, there's a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. But that would add more C and O, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propenoate ester. So substituent B is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So substituent B would contribute 4 C (O-CO-O is 2 C, CH2-CH=CH2 is 3 C, but that's 5 C in total, which might not fit.

Wait, the formula has 11 C. Benzene (6 C) + substituent A (3 C) + substituent B (2 C) → 11 C. So substituent B must be 2 C.

So substituent B is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which is 2 C.

So the structure is benzene with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic Hs: two signals, integrating for 2 H each.

- Vinyl Hs on CH2=CH-: the H on CH2 would be next to the CH, leading to a doublet. The H on CH would be next to CH2, leading to a triplet.

But the NMR states one vinyl H is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the CH2 Hs are a doublet, and the CH Hs are a quartet due to coupling with another group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent that's an ester. But I'm getting stuck again.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the information.

The presence of an ester suggests O2. The NMR shows no CH2 signals, meaning any substituents can't have CH2 groups. So substituents must be either CH3 or groups without CH2.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So the compound has two different methyl groups. For example, one methyl from the ester and another methyl attached directly to the benzene ring.

So substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), substituent B: CH3 (methyl group).

So the structure is benzene with two substituents: O-CO-OCH3 and CH3, para to each other.

But then, where are the vinyl Hs? Because in this structure, there are no vinyl groups. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group, which doesn't have CH2 groups. Wait, a vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which does have CH2.

But the NMR says no CH2 signals. So substituents cannot have CH2 groups. Therefore, substituent B can't be a vinyl group because that would introduce CH2.

Wait, that complicates things. So substituent B must not have any CH2 groups. Therefore, substituent B must be a methyl group or another group without CH2.

But then, where do the vinyl Hs come from? Unless substituent A has a vinyl group.

Wait, substituent A is an ester group, which could have a vinyl group attached to the R part of the ester.

For example, substituent A is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the ester is a propenoate ester.

In this case, substituent A would contribute 4 C (COO- and CH2-CH=CH2), making the total substituent C: 6 (benzene) +4 (ester) = 10 C. But the formula options are up to 12 C. Hmm.

Wait, molecular formula C11H14O2 would have 11 C. So substituent A would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is 4 C. Benzene is 6 C. So substituent B must be another substituent adding 1 C, but that's not possible because substituent B can't be a single C without being a methyl group.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group. So substituents would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (4 C) and CH3 (1 C), totaling 5 C added, leading to 6 +5=11 C. That fits option D (C11H12O2) or A (C11H14O2).

But in this case, substituent A's vinyl group would have Hs on CH2 and CH.

The CH2 adjacent to the ester would have Hs that are split by the adjacent CH=CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the two Hs on the CH.

The Hs on the CH=CH2 would each be split by the adjacent CH2, leading to a doublet of quartets or something similar.

But according to the NMR, one vinyl H is a doublet (so perhaps the CH Hs) and the other is a doublet of quartets (the CH2 Hs).

So in this structure, substituent A contributes the vinyl Hs.

Now, let me count the Hs:

Aromatic Hs: 4 H (two signals each 2 H).

CH3 from substituent B: 3 H.

CH2 from substituent A: 2 H (each from the CH2 group, split as quartets).

CH from substituent A: 2 H (each split into doublet of quartets?).

Wait, but substituent A is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the structure is benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 and benzene-CH3.

Wait, but that's a mono-substituted benzene, not di-substituted. Oh wait, no, substituent A is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 and substituent B is CH3, making it di-substituted.

Wait, but then the substituents are in positions that affect the aromatic Hs.

In this structure, substituent A is a larger group, perhaps in the para position relative to substituent B (CH3).

But the aromatic H signals would be two, each integrating for 2 H.

Now, the substituent A's vinyl group would have:

- CH2 group: 2 H, split by the adjacent CH.

- CH group: 2 H, split by the adjacent CH2.

So, in NMR:

- CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with two Hs on CH).

- CH would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs on CH2).

But the problem states that the vinyl Hs are one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps substituent A is a different structure. Maybe the substituent is O-CO-O-CH=CH2.

In that case, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH=CH2, which is a vinyl ester.

So substituent A is O-CO-O-CH=CH2 (3 C: COO, CH=CH2).

Substituent B is CH3.

So substituents add 3 C (A) + 1 C (B) =4 C. Benzene is 6 C, total 10 C. But the formula options require 11 or 12 C. So perhaps substituent A is longer.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, adding more C, but that's getting too complicated.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the correct answer is option A: C11H14O2.

But I'm not completely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is C12H14O2.

Wait, the substituents might add more carbons. Let me think:

If substituent A is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which is 4 C (COO, and CH2CH3), and substituent B is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), which is 2 C. Then, substituents add 4 +2=6 C. Benzene is 6 C, total 12 C. That would fit option B: C12H14O2.

So substituent A: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), substituent B: CH2=CH-.

But then, substituent B would introduce CH2 groups, which the NMR says are absent. So that's a problem.

Wait, the NMR says no CH2 signals. So substituents can't have CH2 groups. Therefore, substituent B can't be a vinyl group because that would introduce CH2.

This brings me back to the initial confusion. I think I'm going to have to choose based on the information I have.

Since the NMR shows no CH2 signals, substituents can't have any CH2 groups. So any substituents must be CH3 or groups without CH2.

But where do the vinyl Hs come from?

Ah! Wait a minute. If one substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached, like O-CO-O-CH2=CH2, but that's a vinyl group attached to the ester. So substituent A is O-CO-O-CH2=CH2, which contributes 4 C (COO, CH2, CH2).

Substituent B is another group that doesn't have CH2, like CH3.

So substituents add 4 C (A) +1 C (B) =5 C. Benzene is 6 C, total 11 C. Therefore, molecular formula is C11H14O2 (option A).

In this structure, substituent A has a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), which would have Hs on CH2 and CH.

In the NMR, the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the ester would be a quartet (coupled with two Hs on the CH), and the Hs on the CH would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2). But the problem states one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2... but that would introduce CH2 groups, which aren't allowed.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the most likely formula is option A: C11H14O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals, each integrating for 2 protons, indicating two distinct environments for the aromatic protons. This suggests that the substituents are in para positions relative to each other.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group (CH=CH) with specific coupling patterns.
3. **Methyl protons**: Two signals, each integrating for 3 protons, indicating the presence of two distinct methyl groups.
4. **No CH2 signals**: This implies that the substituents do not contain any methylene groups.

### Key Analysis of the Molecular Formula Options:
- **Option A (C11H14O2)**:  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 5, which can correspond to the aromatic ring (3), the ester carbonyl (1), and the vinyl double bond (1). This matches the structural features inferred from the NMR data. The substituents would likely be a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and a vinyl group (CH=CH), with no CH2 groups. This option is consistent with the data.

- **Option B (C12H14O2)**:  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 6, suggesting an additional degree of unsaturation, possibly another double bond or ring. However, the NMR data does not indicate the presence of additional unsaturation beyond the aromatic ring, ester carbonyl, and vinyl group. This option is less likely.

- **Option C (C12H12O2)**:  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 6, similar to Option B, but with fewer hydrogens. The NMR data indicates 14 hydrogens, which does not match this formula.

- **Option D (C11H12O2)**:  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 5, matching the structural features. However, the NMR data indicates 14 hydrogens, which does not match this formula.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that best fits the structural and spectral data is **C11H14O2**, as it accounts for the degrees of unsaturation, the absence of CH2 groups, and the presence of methyl and vinyl protons as described in the NMR spectrum.
