Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian terms usually tell us about the interactions between fields. So X is a boson field, and it's interacting with fermions. The term looks like a Yukawa coupling, similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions, right? The general form is something like λ ψ ψ X, which would mean that the boson X can mediate interactions between two fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find out which fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. In particle physics, when a boson decays into fermions, the rest mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion because energy and momentum must be conserved. So the fermion mass has to be less than or equal to half of X's mass.

Wait, X's mass is 6 GeV, so half of that is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced. But wait, I should consider all the known elementary particles. Let me list the masses of the fermions:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e-): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are very light, but their masses are negligible, so probably not relevant here as they can't be produced in this decay.

Wait, but the problem is about the decay X → f f̄. So any fermion f where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list all the fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Looking at the quarks:

u: 2 MeV → yes
d: 5 MeV → yes
s: ~100 MeV → yes
c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
b: ~4.5 GeV → no, because 4.5 >3 GeV. Wait, wait, 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so b quarks are out. So X can't decay into b b̄ because that would require 2 * 4.5 GeV =9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV.

But wait, wait. Let me get the quark masses correct. I might be mixing up some numbers. Let me think again.

Up quark: about 2.2 MeV (current quark mass)
Down: around 4.7 MeV
Strange: around 95-100 MeV
Charm: around 1.5 GeV
Bottom: about 4.5 GeV
Top is way too heavy.

So for the quarks, u, d, s, and c are under 3 GeV in mass. So X can decay into uū, dđ, s ś, c c̄.

Now for leptons:

Electron: 0.511 MeV → yes
Muon: ~105.7 MeV → yes
Tau: ~1.78 GeV → yes (since 1.78 <3)
Neutrinos: negligible, so likely can't contribute as their rest mass is tiny, but I'm not sure if the problem considers them. However, in the decay, I think the X would have to couple to them. Looking back at the Lagrangian: it's written as ψ_f ψ_f X. Wait, wait, the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure. It looks like a term that couples X to two of the same fermions, because it's ψ_f ψ_f multiplied by X. So X would couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. So, for each fermion f, X can decay into f and f̄.

But wait, what are the possible fermions that X can interact with? The Lagrangian is given as involving ψ_f. So ψ_f would represent any fermion field. So X can interact with any fermion as long as the mass is low enough.

So the allowed fermions are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. So quarks u, d, s, c; and leptons e, μ, τ.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? Its mass is 4.5 GeV, which is higher than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

So the possible decay products are:

uū, dđ, s ś, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, tau pairs are allowed.

So the possible decay channels are the combinations of all these fermions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s ś, uū, dđ, tau, e pairs. But wait, b is 4.5 GeV, so X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b, which is impossible. So A is not correct.

Option B: c c̄, s ś, uū, dđ, tau, mu, e. So all those fermions have masses under 3 GeV. Because c is 1.5 GeV, s is about 100 MeV, u and d even lighter. So yes, this option includes all allowed fermions except the top quark, which is already excluded.

Wait, but let me check each fermion's mass in option B: c is okay, s is okay, u and d are okay, tau is okay, mu is okay, e is okay. So all of these are allowed. Does option B include all the possible fermions? Let's see.

Option B: c c̄, s ś, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, all these fermions are under 3 GeV, so they are allowed. So X can decay into any of these.

Wait, but what about the charm quark? Its mass is about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is exactly half of X's mass (6 GeV). So 3 GeV is allowed, so c c̄ is allowed.

So option B is possible.

Option C includes t t̄, but the top quark is way too heavy (173 GeV), so 2*173 is way beyond 6 GeV. So option C is not possible. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b b̄, which we know is impossible. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A includes b, which is wrong.

Option B doesn't include b, so it's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, what about the tau and others:

Wait, the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

So the correct decays would be all the fermion pairs where each fermion is lighter than 3 GeV.

So the allowed decays are (uū, dđ, s ś, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-). 

Looking at the options, option B lists all of these except the t, which isn't present.

Wait, option B's list is: c c̄, s ś, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So that's all the possible fermions under 3 GeV. So option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the top quark? It's not in any of the correct options. So yes, the correct answer is B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(-\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y)(\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq \frac{m_X}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses:
- **Quarks**:  
  - \( u \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( s \): \( \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  

- **Leptons**:  
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)  

### Allowed Decays:
From the above, the fermions with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:  
\( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \).  
Thus, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:  
\( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).  
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).  

Answer: B
