Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the particles they involve. The main idea is that SMEFT respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, so the operators should maintain those symmetries.

Wait, what about Lorentz symmetry? I think Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental part of the Standard Model. The operators in SMEFT should transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. That means option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz, what about translations? Well, the effective theory is built in a way that includes all possible interactions consistent with the Standard Model's symmetries. Since the Standard Model includes Poincare symmetry, SMEFT should as well. So option 2, Poincare, is probably also required. Wait, but wait, sometimes when you have an effective theory, you might not have the same global symmetries, especially for translations because the effective theory can be thought of as valid up to some scale, but I think in SMEFT, since it's built as a low-energy effective theory, it does still respect Poincare because the SM does. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? The Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry, but it does respect CPT. SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, should also respect CPT symmetry. So option 4, CPT, is definitely a must. 

But what about CP? The SM doesn't have a symmetry under CP, but wait, do the operators in SMEFT have to respect CP? I'm a bit confused here. I think that while the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry (in fact, it violates CP in certain cases, like in the CKM matrix), effective operators in SMEFT might not necessarily have to preserve CP. Because SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. So if the operators can break CP, then the theory as a whole doesn't require CP to be a symmetry. Therefore, option 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily required. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me think again. The SMEFT is an effective theory that respects the same gauge symmetries as the SM, but not necessarily other symmetries like CP. Because the SM itself doesn't have CP as a symmetry, right? So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So option 3 is not necessary, but option 4 is.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So option C is the right answer.

Wait the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer should be C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry because it is a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model. Operators in SMEFT must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry and is consistent with the Standard Model's framework, it also respects Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry, and SMEFT does not require operators to preserve CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP, as this is consistent with the Standard Model's behavior.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT respects it because it is required for consistency with the Standard Model.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**
