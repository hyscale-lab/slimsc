Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons would sum to 6, so Li-6.

Wait, let me get this straight. Lithium's atomic number is 3, so the isotope with 3 neutrons would be Li-6. Okay, so the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of this nucleus is 0.96c.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. So the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, I should calculate gamma for v=0.96c. Let me compute that. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma equals 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that square root: 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857...

But wait, I should be precise here. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) again. Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, correct. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), since Li-6 has a mass number of 6. But wait, more precisely, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is a bit less because the binding energy is accounted for. However, in these kinds of problems, we often approximate using the mass number as the rest mass in u. So m = 6 u.

But wait, one atomic mass unit is approximately 1.660539 x 10^-27 kg. So 6 u would be 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 6 * 1.660539 is about 9.963234e-27 kg.

But wait, another approach: the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m c². So I can calculate that first. Let me compute m c².

c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. So m c² is (6 u) * (c^2). Let me compute that.

Wait, 1 u in terms of energy is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV, which is 5589 MeV or 5.589 GeV. So the rest mass energy is about 5.589 GeV.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3.5714 * 5 is 17.857, 3.5714 * 0.589 is approximately: 3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857, 3.5714 * 0.089 is about 0.317. So 1.7857 + 0.317 ≈ 2.1027. So total E ≈ 17.857 + 2.1027 ≈ 19.9597 GeV. Hmm, so approximately 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but this is an approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.589. Let's break it down. 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857. 3.5714 * 0.589: let's compute that.

3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857.
3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.2857.
3.5714 * 0.009 = 0.03214.

Adding those: 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714 + 0.03214 = 2.10354.

So total E is 17.857 + 2.10354 = 19.96054 GeV.

Wait, but I think there's a more precise way. Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.589.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let's re-calculate gamma.

v = 0.96c. So, beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

0.96^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 3.57142857... So that's precise.

Now, the rest energy is m c^2 = 6 u * c^2.

As earlier, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u is 5589 MeV or 5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.57142857 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication more accurately.

3.57142857 multiplied by 5.589.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 * 0.589 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 * 0.5 = 1.785714285.

3.57142857 * 0.08 = 0.2857142856.

3.57142857 * 0.009 = 0.03214285713.

Adding those together: 1.785714285 + 0.2857142856 = 2.071428571, plus 0.03214285713 = 2.103571428.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.103571428 = 19.96071428 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.9607 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's pretty close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the rest mass. Because the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is slightly less than 6u due to binding energy. Oh, wait, no. The mass of a nucleus is actually less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of the mass defect (E=mc²). So the rest mass of the nucleus is (number of nucleons)*u minus the mass defect.

Wait, but wait, when calculating the rest mass energy, we usually take the mass as the atomic mass, but for heavy ions, sometimes the actual mass is calculated with more precision. For example, in some cases, the mass of a nucleus is taken as Z * proton mass + (N - (some binding)) * neutron mass, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.012 u.

Wait, let me look that up mentally. The exact value, I think, is about 6.012 amu. So 6.012 u.

If that's the case, the rest mass energy is 6.012 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.012 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.012 * 931.5 = 11.178 MeV.

Total: 5589 + 11.178 = 5600.178 MeV, which is 5.600178 GeV.

So that's the rest mass energy, m c² = 5.600178 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.600178 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 * 0.600178 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.14285714.

3.57142857 * 0.000178 ≈ 0.000632653.

So 2.14285714 + 0.000632653 ≈ 2.14348979.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.14348979 = 19.99963264 GeV, approximately 20.0 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's approximately 20.0 GeV. Let me check the exact multiplication with 5.600178.

3.57142857 * 5.600178.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 * 0.600178:

= (3.57142857 * 0.6) + (3.57142857 * 0.000178)

= 2.142857142 + 0.000632653 = 2.143489795.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.143489795 = 20.00063264 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0006 GeV. Which would round to 20.00 GeV, but the options don't have exactly 20.00. The options are A) 18.475, B) 23.069, C) 20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Let me re-calculate gamma more precisely.

v = 0.96c. So beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Calculate 0.96^2:

0.96 * 0.96: 96 * 96 = 9216, so 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Let me check: 0.28^2 = 0.0784, yes.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

But wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) with more decimal points. Let me think: 0.28 is correct, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the actual rest mass is not exactly 6.012 u. Let me think about the exact value. Oh wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.012 u, which is the exact value. So m c² is 6.012 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute 6.012 * 931.5.

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.012 * 931.5 = 11.178.

Total is 5589 + 11.178 = 5600.178 MeV = 5.600178 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.600178 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach:

3.57142857 * 5.600178

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 * 0.600178 = ?

Wait, 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.14285714.

3.57142857 * 0.000178 = let me compute that. 3.57142857 * 0.0001 = 0.000357142857. So 0.000178 is double that: 0.000714285714.

So 3.57142857 * 0.000178 = 0.000714285714.

So 0.600178 is 0.6 + 0.000178, so 3.57142857 * 0.600178 = 2.14285714 + 0.000714285714 ≈ 2.143571426.

So E = 17.85714285 + 2.143571426 = 20.00071428 GeV.

Wait, so that's about 20.0007 GeV. So approximately 20.00 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think: could the question be referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy? No, the question says the energy of the collider, which would typically refer to the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or wait, in high-energy physics, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, or sometimes just the kinetic energy. Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic. So the question is asking for the total energy E = gamma m c^2.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering only the kinetic energy. Let me check the problem statement again.

The question says: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

In collider experiments, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy, or sometimes the total energy. Hmm, this can be a point of confusion.

Wait, in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. So let me think again: perhaps I need to compute the kinetic energy, which is E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) m c².

So if E_kinetic is what the collider is providing, then E = E_kinetic + m c² = gamma m c².

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-examine the wording: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c".

In context, RHIC is a collider that accelerates heavy ions to high energies. The energy here would typically refer to the total (relativistic) energy, not just the kinetic part. So I think the initial approach was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy. Let me see what that gives.

E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma - 1 is approximately 2.57142857.

So E_kinetic = 2.57142857 * 5.600178 GeV.

Compute that:

2.57142857 * 5 = 12.85714285.

2.57142857 * 0.600178 = ?

2.57142857 * 0.6 = 1.542857142.

2.57142857 * 0.000178 = approximately 0.000456585.

So 1.542857142 + 0.000456585 ≈ 1.543313727.

So E_kinetic ≈ 12.85714285 + 1.543313727 ≈ 14.40045658 GeV.

Which is about 14.4 GeV. Looking at the options, none of them are around 14 GeV. So I think the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

So the total energy E is about 20.0 GeV. But the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but I must have made an error because my calculation gave about 20.0007 GeV, but the options have C as 20.132. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 * 5.600178 more accurately.

Break it down:

3.57142857 * 5.600178.

= 3.57142857 * (5 + 0.600178)

= 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

+ 3.57142857 * 0.600178.

Now, 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 * 0.000178 = approximately 0.000632653.

So 0.600178 is 0.6 + 0.000178.

So 3.57142857 * 0.600178 = 2.142857142 + 0.000632653 ≈ 2.143489795.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.143489795 = 20.00063264 GeV.

So approximately 20.0006 GeV, which is about 20.00 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, wait, I think I know where the mistake is. Let me think: the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

Wait, so the exact mass of Li-6 would be calculated as 3 protons + 3 neutrons - binding energy in terms of mass.

So, the sum of individual masses is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665).

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828.

3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995.

Sum: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Now, the actual mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.012 u, so the binding energy (as a mass deficit) is 6.047823 - 6.012 = 0.035823 u.

So the rest mass energy is 6.012 * 931.5 MeV = ?

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.012 * 931.5 = 11.178.

Total: 5589 + 11.178 = 5600.178 MeV = 5.600178 GeV.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers. Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.600178.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.600178:

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 * 0.600178 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 * 0.000178 = ?

3.57142857 * 0.0001 = 0.000357142857.

3.57142857 * 0.000078 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 0.00007 = 0.000250000000.

3.57142857 * 0.000008 = approximately 0.00002857142856.

So 0.00025 + 0.00002857142856 = 0.0002785714286.

So 0.000178 is 0.0001 + 0.000078, so 0.000357142857 + 0.0002785714286 = 0.0006357142856.

So 3.57142857 * 0.000178 ≈ 0.0006357142856.

So 3.57142857 * 0.600178 = 2.142857142 + 0.0006357142856 = 2.143492856.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.143492856 = 20.00063571 GeV.

So approximately 20.0006 GeV, which is very close to 20.00 GeV.

But the options don't have 20, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this with more precise numbers. Let me use exact values.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571...

Mass is 6.012 u.

So m c² = 6.012 * 931.5 MeV = 6.012 * 931.5 = ?

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.012 * 931.5 = 11.178.

Total = 5589 + 11.178 = 5600.178 MeV = 5.600178 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.571428571428571 * 5.600178 GeV.

Compute 3.571428571428571 * 5.600178.

Let me compute:

3 * 5.600178 = 16.800534.

0.571428571428571 * 5.600178.

Wait, 0.571428571428571 is approximately 4/7.

So 4/7 * 5.600178 = ?

5.600178 * 4 = 22.400712.

Divided by 7: 22.400712 / 7 ≈ 3.200101714.

So 3.571428571428571 * 5.600178 = 16.800534 + 3.200101714 ≈ 20.00063571 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0006 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the actual calculation requires more precise figures. Let me see if I can compute 3.57142857 * 5.600178 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact value of the rest mass. Another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, but the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me compute that and see.

Kinetic energy, E_kin = (gamma - 1) * m c^2.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1 = 2.57142857.

E_kin = 2.57142857 * 5.600178 GeV.

Compute that:

2.57142857 * 5 = 12.85714285.

2.57142857 * 0.600178 = ?

2.57142857 * 0.6 = 1.542857142.

2.57142857 * 0.000178 = 0.000456585714.

So 1.542857142 + 0.000456585714 = 1.543313728.

So E_kin = 12.85714285 + 1.543313728 ≈ 14.40045658 GeV.

But that's not one of the options either. So I'm confident that the total energy is about 20.00 GeV.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But my calculation is 20.0006 GeV, which isn't exactly 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of the rest mass energy. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6 in kilograms. Let me compute that.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.012 u. One atomic mass unit (u) is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m = 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute that:

6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 1.99264688e-28 kg.

So total m = 9.9632343996e-27 + 1.99264688e-28 = 1.01624999e-26 kg? Wait, no, wait, 0.012 is 1.2e-2. So 6.012 * 1.660539e-27 = (6 * 1.660539e-27) + (0.012 * 1.660539e-27) = 9.963234e-27 + 1.9926468e-28 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.19926468e-26 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.19926468e-26 = 1.0162499e-26 kg? Wait, no, wait: 0.012 * 1.660539e-27 = 1.9926468e-28 kg. So adding to 9.9632343996e-27 kg gives:

9.9632343996e-27 + 1.9926468e-28 = 9.9632343996e-27 + 0.19926468e-27 = 10.1625e-27 kg? Hmm, perhaps I should write it as 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute m c^2 using these precise values.

m = 6.012 u = 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 1.00000000000e-26 kg? Wait, 6 * 1.660539e-27 is 9.963234e-27 kg. 0.012 * 1.660539e-27 = 1.9926468e-28 kg. So total is 9.963234e-27 + 1.9926468e-28 = 1.0162499e-26 kg.

Wait, that can't be right because 6.012 u is 6.012 * 1.66e-27 kg.

Wait, 6.012 * 1.660539e-27 = ?

Let me compute:

6 * 1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27.

0.012 * 1.660539e-27 = 1.9926468e-28.

So total m = 9.963234e-27 + 1.9926468e-28 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.19926468e-27 = (9.963234 + 0.19926468) e-27 = 10.16249868e-27 kg.

So m = 1.016249868e-26 kg.

Now, m c² = 1.016249868e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute that:

(3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² = 1.016249868e-26 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.146248812e-10 J.

But 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, so m c² in eV is:

9.146248812e-10 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = approximately 5.707e9 eV = 5.707 GeV.

Wait, that's about 5.707 GeV, which is higher than the earlier 5.600 GeV.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of m c².

Hmm, but earlier, using 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c², I calculated m c² as 6.012 * 931.5 MeV = 5600.178 MeV = 5.600178 GeV.

But using precise calculation, I get 5.707 GeV. So there's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the value of 1 u in MeV/c². The exact value is approximately 931.494 MeV/c².

So 6.012 u * 931.494 MeV/u = 6.012 * 931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964.

0.012 *931.494 = 11.177928.

Total = 5588.964 + 11.177928 = 5600.141928 MeV = 5.600141928 GeV.

So that's about 5.60014 GeV, which aligns with my earlier calculation.

But when I computed m c² using precise values, I got 5.707 GeV, which doesn't align. So I must have made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated when converting m c² from joules to eV.

Let me recompute m c².

m = 6.012 u = 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 = let me compute that.

6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27.

0.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 1.99264687992e-28.

So total m = 9.9632343996e-27 + 1.99264687992e-28 = 9.9632343996e-27 + 0.199264687992e-27 = 10.1624990876e-27 kg = 1.01624990876e-26 kg.

Now, c = 3e8 m/s.

m c² = 1.01624990876e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² = 1.01624990876e-26 * 9e16 = 9.14624917884e-10 J.

Now, converting joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So m c² (eV) = 9.14624917884e-10 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV.

Compute that: 9.14624917884e-10 / 1.602176634e-19 = (9.14624917884 / 1.602176634) * 1e9.

Compute 9.14624917884 / 1.602176634 ≈ 5.707.

So 5.707 * 1e9 eV = 5.707 GeV.

But this contradicts the earlier calculation of 5.600 GeV. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I think I know the error. The mistake is in the definition of u. The atomic mass unit (u) is defined as 1 u = m_c / 1836.15269... where m_c is the mass of the carbon-12 atom. But when calculating rest mass energy, using 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² is correct for the energy, but when calculating m, 1 u in mass is 1.660539e-27 kg, and when multiplied by c², it gives 931.494 MeV.

So my precise calculation gave m c² as 5.707 GeV, but the earlier approach using 931.5 MeV/u gave 5.600 GeV. These two can't both be correct, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute m c² using the precise values.

Let me compute m c^2 = (6.012 u) * c^2.

But 1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg, and 1 u in energy is 931.494 MeV.

So, 6.012 u in energy is 6.012 * 931.494 MeV = ?

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964.

0.012 *931.494 = 11.177928.

Total: 5588.964 + 11.177928 = 5600.141928 MeV = 5.600141928 GeV.

So that's correct.

But the calculation using kg and joules gave 5.707 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of m.

Wait, computing 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27.

0.012 *1.66053906660e-27 = 1.99264687992e-28.

So sum: 9.9632343996e-27 + 1.99264687992e-28 = 1.01624990876e-26 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, m c^2 = 1.01624990876e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So 1.01624990876e-26 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.14624917884e-10 kg m²/s², which is joules.

Now, converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So 9.14624917884e-10 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = ?

Compute 9.14624917884e-10 / 1.602176634e-19 = (9.14624917884 / 1.602176634) * 1e9.

Compute 9.14624917884 / 1.602176634 ≈ 5.707.

So 5.707e9 eV = 5.707 GeV.

But this contradicts the earlier 5.600 GeV.

I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't find where. Perhaps I should accept that and proceed.

Assuming that the rest mass energy is 5.600 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.57142857 * 5.600 GeV.

3.57142857 *5 is 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

So 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 = 20.000 GeV.

So the answer should be approximately 20.00 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but not exact. But perhaps the precise calculation using more accurate gamma would give a slightly higher value.

Wait, perhaps using gamma with more decimal points would change the result.

Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.96c.

beta = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571.

So that's precise.

So 3.571428571428571 * 5.600178 GeV.

Compute using more precise multiplication.

Let me compute:

3.571428571428571 * 5.600178.

= 3.571428571428571 * (5 + 0.600178)

= 3.571428571428571 *5 = 17.857142857142855.

+ 3.571428571428571 * 0.600178.

Compute 3.571428571428571 * 0.6 = 2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 * 0.000178 = 0.0006357142857142857.

So 0.600178 is 0.6 + 0.000178, so 3.571428571428571 * 0.600178 = 2.142857142857142 + 0.0006357142857142857 = 2.143492857142856.

So E = 17.857142857142855 + 2.143492857142856 = 20.00063571428571 GeV.

So approximately 20.0006357 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, but that's higher than our calculated 20.0006 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approximation for gamma, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is taken as 6 u exactly, which would make m c² = 5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.589 = ?

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 = ?

0.5 *3.57142857 = 1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857 = 0.2857142856.

0.009 *3.57142857 = 0.03214285713.

Sum: 1.785714285 + 0.2857142856 = 2.0714285706 + 0.03214285713 = 2.1035714277.

So E = 17.85714285 + 2.1035714277 = 19.960714277 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher, and option A is 18.475 GeV, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy.

So, E = gamma * m c^2.

But if the question is about the kinetic energy, the calculation would be (gamma-1)*m c^2.

Which would be 2.57142857 * 5.600178 GeV.

Wait, that would be about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, and my calculation is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, beta = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the actual rest mass energy is higher. Let me compute m c² using the precise u value.

m = 6.012 u.

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².

So m c² = 6.012 * 931.494 MeV.

Calculate that:

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.012 * 931.494 = 11.177928 MeV.

Total: 5588.964 + 11.177928 = 5600.141928 MeV = 5.600141928 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.600141928.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600141928 = ?

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000141928 = approximately 0.0005066.

So 2.142857142 + 0.0005066 = 2.143363742.

So E = 17.85714285 + 2.143363742 = 20.00050659 GeV.

Rounded to five decimal places, that's 20.0005 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, which is higher by about 0.1315 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the actual calculation uses more precise values for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the calculation uses a more precise beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

Let me compute gamma using more precise beta.

beta = 0.96.

beta squared = 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

1 - beta squared = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.571428571428571 multiplied by 5.600141928 GeV.

Let me compute this using higher precision.

3.571428571428571 *5.600141928.

Break it down:

3 *5.600141928 = 16.800425784.

0.571428571428571 *5.600141928.

0.5 *5.600141928 = 2.800070964.

0.071428571428571 *5.600141928.

Compute 0.07 *5.600141928 = 0.392009935.

0.001428571428571 *5.600141928 ≈ 0.007998003.

So sum for 0.07142857...: 0.392009935 + 0.007998003 ≈ 0.400007938.

So 0.571428571428571 *5.600141928 ≈ 2.800070964 + 0.400007938 = 3.200078902.

So total E = 16.800425784 + 3.200078902 = 20.000504686 GeV.

So approximately 20.00050469 GeV, which is about 20.0005 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the actual calculation uses more precise values for the rest mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0121996 u.

Ah, so perhaps I should use 6.0121996 u instead of 6.012 u.

So m c² = 6.0121996 * 931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0121996 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494 = 9.31494.

0.0021996 *931.494 ≈ 2.04309.

So total 9.31494 + 2.04309 = 11.35803 MeV.

So total m c² = 5588.964 + 11.35803 = 5600.32203 MeV = 5.60032203 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.571428571428571 *5.60032203 GeV.

Compute:

3.571428571428571 *5 =17.857142857142855.

3.571428571428571 *0.60032203 = ?

3.571428571428571 *0.6 =2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 *0.00032203 ≈0.001148395.

So 2.142857142857142 + 0.001148395 ≈2.144005537.

So E ≈17.857142857142855 +2.144005537 ≈20.00114839 GeV.

Still, approximately 20.0011 GeV.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not seeing where the discrepancy comes from. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the calculation in the question uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy. Let me compute that.

E_kin = (gamma -1)*m c^2.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma -1 =2.57142857.

E_kin = 2.57142857 *5.600141928 GeV.

Compute:

2 *5.600141928 =11.200283856.

0.57142857 *5.600141928.

0.5 *5.600141928=2.800070964.

0.07142857 *5.600141928 ≈0.400007938.

So 2.800070964 +0.400007938=3.200078902.

So E_kin=11.200283856 +3.200078902=14.40036276 GeV.

Which isn't an option. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

In this case, the closest option to my calculation is not present. But perhaps the intended answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 u, giving E = 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 = let's compute.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.009 *3.57142857=0.03214285713.

Sum: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856 =2.0714285706 +0.03214285713=2.1035714277.

So E=17.85714285 +2.1035714277=19.960714277 GeV.

Which is about 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options, option A is 18.475 GeV, which is lower, and option C is 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, another approach to calculate gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216).

= 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

But what if I compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely?

Wait, 0.28^2 =0.0784 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

But perhaps using more precise beta values could change things, but in this case, beta is given as 0.96 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to use the relativistic energy formula, but with units in GeV and considering the nucleus as a certain mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as the mass number in GeV/c².

Wait, the mass number (A) is 6 for Li-6.

Assuming that 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So m c² = 6 *0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

Then, gamma =3.57142857.

E = 3.57142857 *5.589 = ?

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 = ?

3 *0.589=1.767.

0.57142857 *0.589= approx 0.5714*0.589≈0.3357.

So 1.767 +0.3357=2.1027.

So E=17.85714285 +2.1027=19.9598 GeV ≈19.96 GeV.

Which again is about 19.96 GeV.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, and the given options have a typo.

But I can't see my calculation leading to that value.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, and the problem is using a different value for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum and then use E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

But since v is given, we can find momentum p = gamma m v.

v =0.96c.

p = gamma * m * 0.96c.

So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But wait, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So E² = (gamma m beta c * c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

= gamma² m² beta² c^4 + m² c^4.

= m² c^4 (gamma² beta² + 1).

But gamma² (beta²) = gamma² (1/gamma²) )=1.

So E² = m^2 c^4 (1 +1 ) = 2 m² c^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, gamma^2 beta^2 = (1/(1-beta^2)) * beta^2.

Which is beta^2/(1-beta^2) = beta^2 (gamma^2) = (v^2/c^2) gamma^2.

But E = gamma m c^2, and p c = gamma m beta c^2.

So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Which is (gamma m beta c^2)^2 + (gamma m c^2)^2 (no, E is gamma m c²).

Wait, no, (p c) = gamma m beta c^2.

So (p c)^2 = gamma^2 m^2 beta^2 c^4.

And (m c²)^2 = m^2 c^4.

So E² = (gamma^2 m^2 beta^2 c^4) + (m^2 c^4) = m^2 c^4 (gamma^2 beta^2 +1).

But since gamma^2 beta^2 = (1/(1-beta^2)) * beta^2 = beta^2/(1-beta^2).

So E² = m^2 c^4 [beta^2/(1 - beta^2) + 1] = m^2 c^4 [ (beta^2 + 1 - beta^2) / (1 - beta^2) ) ] = m^2 c^4 [ 1/(1 - beta^2) ) ].

Which is (m^2 c^4) * (1/(1-beta^2)).

But 1/(1-beta^2) is gamma², so E² = m^2 c^4 gamma^2 → E = gamma m c^2.

Which brings us back to the original formula.

So nothing changes with this approach.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Based on my calculations, the total energy is approximately 20.00 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but my precise calculation doesn't reach that. So perhaps the intended answer is C, and I might have made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass of Li-6 is 6.012 u, and thus m c² is 5.600 GeV, giving E = 3.57142857 *5.600 = 20.00 GeV.

But given the options, I think the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise gamma.

Compute gamma for v=0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.571428571428571.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I think the intended answer is C) 20.132 GeV, but based on my calculation, it's approximately 20.00 GeV, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the kinetic energy, but that gives about 14.4 GeV, which also isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem using the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option B) 23.069 GeV. But I can't see how that would happen.

Another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the mass of Li-6 is taken as 7 u? No, Li-6 has mass 6 u.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the binding energy more accurately. The mass of Li-6 is 6.012 u, so that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the energy is approximately 20.00 GeV, which isn't an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the beam energy per nucleon, not per nucleus. But no, the question states the speed of nucleus X, so it's per nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus has a charge that affects the energy? No, in terms of mass, the charge doesn't affect the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the initial assumption that gamma is 3.57142857. Let me compute gamma using more precise methods.

Compute beta = 0.96.

beta squared = 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - beta squared = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 20.00 GeV, but since it's not an option, I must choose the closest option, which is option C) 20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.600141928.

= 3.57142857 *5.600141928.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 ×5.600141928:

First, 3 ×5.600141928=16.800425784.

0.57142857 ×5.600141928.

Compute 0.5 ×5.600141928=2.800070964.

0.07142857 ×5.600141928.

Compute 0.07 ×5.600141928=0.392009935.

0.00142857 ×5.600141928≈0.007998003.

So sum for 0.07142857: 0.392009935 + 0.007998003 =0.400007938.

So 0.57142857 ×5.600141928=2.800070964 +0.400007938=3.200078902.

Total E=16.800425784 +3.200078902=20.000504686 GeV.

So 20.0005 GeV.

But the options don't have that. I think the intended answer must be option C) 20.132 GeV, but I can't see where the error is in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is taken as 6.0121996 u, which would make m c² =6.0121996 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0121996 *931.494=11.358 MeV.

Total m c²=5588.964 +11.358=5600.322 MeV=5.600322 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.600322.

= 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600322=?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000322=0.001148395.

So sum=2.142857142 +0.001148395=2.144005537.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.144005537=20.00114839 GeV.

Still about 20.0011 GeV.

I think I have to conclude that the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but my calculation doesn't reach that. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C), and I made a mistake in the calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Lithium-6, \( ^6\text{Li} \)) is \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus \( X \) has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.012 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The total energy \( E \) of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The rest mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \) is \( 6.012 \, \text{u} \). Converting to energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.012 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5600.141928 \, \text{MeV} = 5.600141928 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.600141928 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:

\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
3.57142857 \times 0.600141928 \approx 2.143571427 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these:

\[
E \approx 17.85714285 + 2.143571427 = 20.00071428 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.0007 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While the precise calculation yields \( 20.0007 \, \text{GeV} \), minor approximations or rounding differences likely account for the slight discrepancy.
