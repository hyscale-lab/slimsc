Okay, so I've got this physics problem about angular momentum operators, specifically the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices or something similar. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The Pauli Y matrix is exactly that. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So, the operator A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix.

The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. Let me write down the matrix for Ay. The Pauli Y matrix σy is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So multiplying by c = h/(4π), Ay becomes:
[ 0          (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0          ]

So Ay matrix is:
[ 0           -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)     0        ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - λ I) is:
[ -λ       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -λ       ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)). Let's calculate that.

(-λ)^2 - ( (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2 )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (1) * (h/(4π))^2.

So determinant = λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/ something?) Wait, wait: sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π), since 16 is 4 squared. So λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2?), no wait, no. Wait, sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π) * (1/2?), wait no, wait.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. λ² = (h^2)/(16 π²). So λ = ± sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) = ± h/(4π). Oh, right! Because sqrt(16)=4, and sqrt(π^2)=π. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option B talks about eigenvalues with imaginary parts. That doesn't make sense because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Oh wait, wait, is Ay Hermitian? Let me check.

The matrix S is σy, which is Hermitian because σy† = σy. Because the (0, -i) row becomes (0, i), and the (i, 0) becomes (-i, 0), but σy is actually anti-Hermitian, wait no. Wait, σy is Hermitian because σy^dagger equals σy. Let me confirm: σy^† would have the first row as (0, i), and the second row as (-i, 0). Oh wait, no, because the original σy is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], so the conjugate transpose would be [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is -σy. Wait, so σy is anti-Hermitian, because σy^† = -σy. So then, if S is anti-Hermitian, then Ay = c S would be anti-Hermitian if c is real. Because if S is anti-Hermitian, S† = -S. So (c S)† = c* (-S). Since c is h/(4π), which is real, c* is c, so Ay† = -c S = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but that's a problem because eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real, but for anti-Hermitian operators, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. But wait, in this case, the problem says that the operator A_y is given, and we're to find its eigenvalues. So since Ay is anti-Hermitian, its eigenvalues would be purely imaginary.

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? Oh wait, no. The σ matrices are Hermitian. Because σx, σy, σz are all Hermitian. Because their transposes equal their complex conjugates. Let me check σy again. σy is [0, -i; i, 0]. The conjugate transpose would be [0, i; -i, 0], which is equal to σy's negative (because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so the conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is -σy. So σy is anti-Hermitian. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, σy is Hermitian? Because the definition is that an operator is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Let me compute σy†: the (1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i. So σy† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -σy. So σy† = -σy. Hence, σy is anti-Hermitian, which would mean that Ay is anti-Hermitian as well. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be purely imaginary.

So then, the eigenvalues we found earlier are real, which can't be right. Wait, wait, that means I made a mistake in the calculation. Because if Ay is anti-Hermitian, its eigenvalues should be imaginary. Let me re-examine the eigenvalue equation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the characteristic equation. Let me try again.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues are found by solving det( [ [ -λ, -i c ], [i c, -λ ] ] ) = 0.

The determinant is ( -λ )^2 - ( (-i c) * (i c) )

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c² = (i²) * c² = (-1) c².

So determinant is λ² - (-1 c²) = λ² + c² = 0 → λ² = - c² → λ = ± i c.

So the eigenvalues are ± i c, which is ± i h/(4π).

Wait, that makes sense because Ay is anti-Hermitian, so eigenvalues are imaginary. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary numbers: ± i h/(4π). So their real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because our eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So option A is incorrect.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't match our result. So option B is also incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm. Let's think. A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since A is the Y-component, and S is the generator, A² must be part of the angular momentum operator's square. Remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the square of the total angular momentum is ( (h/2π) * sqrt(s(s+1)) )². But wait, the operator A is just the Y-component, so A² would be (c S)^2 = c² S². Since S is σy, which squared is identity matrix times 1/4? Wait no. Let's compute S².

Wait, σy is the Pauli matrix. Each Pauli matrix squared is identity. So σy^2 = I. So S^2 = I. Therefore, A² = c² I. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A², because for any vector, A² acting on it would just multiply by c². So eigenvectors of Ay are eigenvectors of A². So option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, which is correct. But what about Az, the Z-component?

Az would be c times σz, perhaps. The eigenfunctions of Ay and Az are different because σy and σz don't commute. So their eigenvectors are not the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, what does that mean? The basis functions of the matrix? The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the eigenvectors would span the space. But is that what option D is saying? It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not exactly sure what 'basis functions' mean in this context. Well, the matrix operator acts on the space of these functions, and the eigenvectors form a basis for that space. So, perhaps D is correct, but I'm not certain. Let me think more.

But since in option C, the statement is correct about eigenvectors of Ay being eigenvectors of A², which is true because A² is a multiple of identity, which commutes with everything. So any vector is an eigenvector of A². So option C's first part is correct. The second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct because if you have a state that's an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az because Az and Ay don't commute. So option C is a correct statement.

Wait, but looking back, in the problem statement, it's the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So the operator is A = (h/4π) σy. Let me think about the possible options again.

So the eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). So the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±h/(4π). So none of the options A or B are correct because their real parts are not zero. So the correct answer must be either C or D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The basis functions of the matrix operator? I think this refers to the fact that the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space that the matrix operates on. So that would be correct. So both options C and D make statements that could be correct, but let's see.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which statements hold true.

So let's look at the options again. Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az.

Since A² is (h²/16 π²) I, any vector is an eigenvector of A² with eigenvalue (h²/16 π²). So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

That's correct because Az is another component of angular momentum, which doesn't share eigenvectors with Ay since they don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm not exactly sure what that implies, but perhaps it's correct. The eigenvectors form a basis, so any vector can be written as a linear combination of them. But I'm not certain if that's what D is stating. Alternatively, D might be incorrect because the basis functions are just the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenvectors.

Wait, but the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis in this case, so they are the basis functions. So D could be correct as well.

Hmm. But which option is correct? The question is about which statement is correct during calculation.

So, let's go through each option again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). So real parts are zero, so A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because the eigenvalues have imaginary parts h/(4π), which is a real number, not 1/2. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so all eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of A². And they can't be eigenvectors of Az because they don't commute.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, perhaps. The basis functions refer to the eigenvectors? If so, then yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D might be correct, but let's think about what each option says.

Looking again, option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because any state that's an eigenstate of Ay is automatically an eigenstate of A² (since A² is a scalar multiple of identity), and they are not eigenstates of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's also correct because the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmmm. Now I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the options again.

The question states that the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two in number, forming a complete basis. So D's statement is correct because the eigenvectors are the basis functions (assuming 'basis functions' refers to the basis of the vector space on which the operator acts).

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, which of the options is a correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps D refers to the matrix's basis. So, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the matrix operator, meaning the matrix is diagonal in that basis. So, that's correct because diagonalization is about choosing a basis of eigenvectors.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct.

So, perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct. So I need to determine which is correct.

Wait, let me recall that for Pauli matrices, the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of the spin component in the Y-direction. So, for Ay, the eigenstates are along Y, while Az is along Z. So, the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az.

So, option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That seems correct because the matrix is 2x2 and the eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions do form a basis for the vector space. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's see.

So during the calculation, which statements hold?

If I calculate the eigenvalues, I find they're ±i h/(4π), not real numbers. So in the process, I would realize that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

So, looking at the options, for the eigenvalues, only none of the options except perhaps none have the correct eigenvalues. Wait, but in the options, none match ±i h/(4π). So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are a=±h/(4π) * i. So the eigenvalues have real parts zero and imaginary parts ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That's way off because the real parts are zero.

Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also incorrect.

So none of the options A or B are correct.

Thus, the correct options are C and D. So which one is correct?

Option C: eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Correct.

But the question is which statement is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But the options are presented as single correct options.

Wait, the problem says, "which statement below will you consider to be correct?" So only one option is correct.

Hmm. Let me re-examine the options:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Does that mean that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix? Or that they form the basis for the vector space on which the operator acts? Because any operator's eigenvectors, if they form a basis, would imply that the operator can be diagonalized in that basis.

So for a 2x2 matrix, if it has two linearly independent eigenvectors, which it does, then they form a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

So, options C and D could both be correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, perhaps one of the options is correct.

I think I need to go back to the options.

Let me read each option again carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Which might mean that the eigenfunctions form the basis for which the matrix is diagonal, which is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements. But since the options are presented as multiple-choice with only one correct answer, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvalues.

Wait, recalculating the eigenvalues:

Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The characteristic equation is:

| Ay - λ I | = 0 → | (-λ)   (-i c) | = 0 → λ² + c² = 0 → λ = ±i c.

Where c = h/(4π), so λ = ±i h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with real parts zero.

So any option that says the eigenvalues have non-zero real parts is incorrect. So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, looking at the options again, only options C and D are possible.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As A² = c² I, which commutes with everything, any eigenvector of Ay is an eigenvector of A². So correct.

But what about Az? Az is (h/(4π)) σz. The eigenvectors of σy and σz are different, so vectors that are eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So the statement in option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. But the matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during calculation.

So, given that, both C and D could be correct.

But since the options are given as A, B, C, D, only one can be correct, perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the operator is A_y, but the matrix is given as S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σy. So the operator is A_y = c σy. So, eigenfunctions are eigenvectors of σy, which are |+y> and |-y> states. The A^2 operator is (c σy)^2 = c² σy² = c² (σy σy) = c² I. So any vector is an eigenvector of A², with eigenvalue c².

Thus, the eigenvectors of Ay will be eigenvectors of A² as well. So option C's first part is correct.

Now, what about option D? The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis for the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors are two distinct and non-parallel vectors, they form a basis for the 2D space. So the operator matrix can be diagonal in this basis. So option D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because both C and D seem correct. But perhaps the question is designed so that only one is correct. Let me reread the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, if the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, that's correct. So D is correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question is about which statement is correct. Let me think: the correct statements are option C and D. But perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator is A_y. The eigenfunctions of A_y are the basis functions for the operator, meaning that in this basis, the operator is diagonal. So option D is correct.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are not the eigenfunctions of A², but wait no, because A² is c² I, which commutes with everything. So any state is an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So, with all that in mind, I think the correct options are C and D. But since I need to choose one, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct, because the operator's matrix in that basis is diagonal. So option D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. Maybe the correct answer is D.

Wait, another approach: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix can be written in terms of those basis functions. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

I'm a bit stuck here, but I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
\left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Thus, the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
\lambda^2 + \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

The eigenvalues are purely imaginary: \( \lambda = \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi} \). The real parts of the eigenvalues are zero, and the imaginary parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
#### **Option A**
This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 2\pi h \). Additionally, the real parts are zero, not \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

#### **Option B**
This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).

#### **Option C**
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the \( Z \)-component \( A_z \). 

- \( A^2 = (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2 + (A_x)^2 \). For a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle, \( A^2 = \left(\frac{h}{2\pi}\right)^2 \cdot 3 \cdot I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Since \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). This part is correct.
- The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This part is also correct.

Thus, Option C is correct.

#### **Option D**
This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). 

The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space on which \( A_y \) acts. In this basis, the matrix representation of \( A_y \) is diagonal. Therefore, this statement is correct.

### Step 3: Final Decision
Both Options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct **during the calculation**. While Option D is true in a general sense, Option C directly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is a key insight during the calculation. Therefore, Option C is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer: C**
