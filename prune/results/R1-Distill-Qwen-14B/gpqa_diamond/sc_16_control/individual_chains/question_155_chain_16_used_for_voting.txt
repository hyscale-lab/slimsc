Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. But let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that we have an operator P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is given by the square root of the variance, which is ⟨ψ| P^2 |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩². So, for Pz, ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

First, I should compute ⟨Pz⟩. Since the state is given, I can compute this by taking the expectation value of Pz. Then, I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩. But wait, since Pz is a Hermitian operator (because it's an observable), its square is just Pz squared, so ⟨Pz²⟩ is the expectation of Pz squared.

Wait, but looking at the matrix for Pz: the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], the second is [0,0,0], and the third is [0,0,-ħ]. So it's a diagonal matrix, right? Oh, wait no, wait. It's actually diagonal only if the matrix is aligned that way. Let me write out the matrix form of Pz.

Pz is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Yes, so it's diagonal. That makes things easier because when you operate on a state, it just multiplies each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

The state vector ψ is given as [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So, since the basis is the Pz eigenvectors, the state is expressed in that basis. Therefore, the components of ψ are the coefficients in the eigenbasis of Pz.

So, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I can just multiply each component of ψ by the corresponding eigenvalue of Pz and sum them up. Because in the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal, so the expectation value is straightforward.

The eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ. Let's see:

The first component of ψ is -1/2, which is the coefficient for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ. So, that contributes (-1/2) * ħ.

The second component is 1/√2, and the eigenvalue here is 0, so that term is zero.

The third component is -1/2, which is the coefficient for eigenvalue -ħ. So that contributes (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (1/2) ħ.

Adding these together: (-1/2 ħ) + (0) + (1/2 ħ) = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Next, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩. But since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared will also be diagonal, with each diagonal element being the square of the eigenvalues of Pz. So the eigenvalues squared are (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

So, Pz² is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is the sum of the coefficients squared multiplied by the corresponding squared eigenvalues.

Let me compute each term:

First component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².
Second component: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = (1/2) * 0 = 0.
Third component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Adding them up: (1/4 + 0 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the variance is ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩². Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, the variance is just (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔPz is the square root of (1/2) ħ², which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a moment. Another approach: since the state is in the eigenbasis of Pz, the uncertainty might be zero? But wait, no, this state is not an eigenstate of Pz. Because if it were, then the expectation of Pz would be a single value, and the uncertainty would be zero. But the state given has non-zero components in all three Pz eigenstates, so it's a superposition.

Wait, let me double-check: looking at the state ψ, it's [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1, I think.

Let's compute that: (1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So it's a normalized state, good.

But since the state is given in the Pz eigenbasis, each component is the amplitude for that eigenstate. So when you compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's just the sum of each component multiplied by its eigenvalue.

Earlier calculation gave me 0. And ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/2) ħ². So the variance is (1/2) ħ², so the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to compute the uncertainty is to find the standard deviation. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, the uncertainty in Pz when the state is in the eigenbasis of Pz is sqrt( sum |c_i|^2 (λ_i^2 - (sum c_j λ_j)^2 ) ), but since in this case the sum of c_j λ_j is zero, it's sqrt( sum |c_i|^2 λ_i^2 ), which aligns with what I did before.

So yeah, all signs point to option B: ħ over square root of 2.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix:

\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with entries $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 (0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
