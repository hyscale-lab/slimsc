Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but hopefully, I can figure it out.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, that might not be right. Oh wait, maybe it's actually L(y) = -λ_f [ψ_f(y)] (ῡ + X(y)) [ψ_f(y)]? Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps I should focus on the given information rather than the exact form of the Lagrangian.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I'm thinking that the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term suggests that X couples to fermions.

So, the possible decays would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. But what fermions are allowed?

I remember that in particle physics, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into. Because, in the rest frame of X, the fermions need to have enough energy to be created. So the condition is m_X ≥ 2 m_f.

But wait, what fermions are available? The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos), and the corresponding antiquarks (like anti-up, anti-down, etc.).

Wait, but neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So if X is 6 GeV, 2 m_ν would be like almost nothing, so X could decay into νν̄. But wait, looking at the options, none of them include neutrinos. So perhaps the given options assume that neutrinos are too light to consider, or the coupling isn't there.

Wait, but the interaction term given is L = -λ_f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting that. Let me parse it again. It looks like ψ_f is a Dirac spinor, so (ῡ + X) would be a scalar? Or perhaps the term is more like ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, which would imply that X is a scalar field. Or maybe it's ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f^dagger? Not sure, but perhaps the term is written correctly. Alternatively, maybe the term is something like ψ_f gamma^mu (ῡ + X) psi_f, but the given term here isn't clear. But perhaps that's a distraction; the key point is that X couples to fermions, so can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair allowed by the mass condition.

So, back to the mass condition. X is 6 GeV, so each fermion f must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 / 2 = 3 GeV). So I need to find all fermions with mass ≤ 3 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- Up quark: about 2.2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV (so 4.5 > 3 GeV; so X can't decay into b quarks)
- Top quark: way heavier, like 173 GeV, so no.

Similarly, leptons:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible mass.

So for fermions lighter than or equal to 3 GeV, the possible ones are:

Leptons: e, mu, tau (since tau is ~1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV)
Quarks: u, d, s, c. Because their masses are under 3 GeV.

Wait, but the bottom quark is ~4.5 GeV, so 4.5 >3, so X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV must be ≥ 2 m_f. For example, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Charm quark is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So X can decay into c c-bar.

So possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the neutrinos? Since their mass is negligible, maybe X can decay into νν̄, but the options don't include any neutrino options, so I'll ignore them.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.
But wait, b is ~4.5 GeV. So 2 m_b is 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So option A is invalid because it includes b.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
So that includes c, which is allowed because 2m_c ~3 GeV. So this is possible.

Option C: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
But top quark is way too heavy. So that's impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Again, includes b, which is not allowed. So option D is invalid.

So the only valid option is option B. Because it includes c, which is allowed, but no b.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the quarks again. The strange quark is ~100 MeV, so 2m_s is 0.2 GeV, which is way less than 6 GeV, so s is allowed.

So option B includes c, s, u, d, which are all allowed, plus tau, mu, e. So all these are allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, allowing decays of the form \( X \rightarrow f \bar{f} \), where \( f \) is a fermion. For such decays to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2 m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Step 1: Identify fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)
The fermion masses in the Standard Model are as follows:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Neutrinos (\( \nu \)): Negligible mass (but not included in the options).

Thus, the allowed fermions are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \).

### Step 2: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \). All these fermions satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Valid**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are given in **Option B**.
