Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, which means as plx decreases, the distance increases. But how does this affect the number of stars in a given parallax range?

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So I guess I need to think about how many stars are there at different distances, which translates to different parallaxes.

Assuming a uniform distribution, that would imply that there are stars spread out equally in all directions, but wait—uniform in what sense? Uniform in space, so density is constant. So the number density of stars is uniform in space. But when we observe them, the ones closer to us have larger parallaxes.

Let me model this. The number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. Since the density is uniform, the number of stars is density (n) multiplied by 4π d² dd. So number of stars N = n * 4π d² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Wait, so substituting d, we get N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) d(plx)? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing variables here. Let me think again.

Wait, if parallax plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by a small amount dplx, what's the corresponding change in d? Well, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by d d = -(1/plx²) dplx. But maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is a spherical shell at distance d = 1/plx, with thickness dd. So volume is 4π d² dd. But dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx² )? Wait, wait, perhaps not. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. But here, r is d, the distance. So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dr = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the volume:

dN = n * 4π d² dr = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, the negative is just about the direction, so when plx increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, it's positive. So dN is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. So that's (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So that's dN per dplx, which is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the substitution.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness in distance. So N = k * 4π d² * dd, where k is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, N is proportional to 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² ) dplx. Since dN is proportional to that, so dN/dplx is proportional to (1/plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm not sure about the exact dependence. Maybe I should think in terms of how the area on the sky and the depth contribute. Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of how many stars are located in a given range of parallax.

Wait, let's think of it as a function of parallax plx. For a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance range is from d=1/plx to d'=1/(plx + dplx). The number of stars in that distance shell is proportional to the volume between d'=1/(plx + dplx) and d=1/plx.

Wait, actually, that's not quite correct. Because when plx increases, d decreases. So the shell between d and d + dd is a spherical shell, but in terms of plx, each plx corresponds to a d. So the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π d² dd, where dd is the change in d corresponding to dplx.

As before, dd = (d (plxd))^{-1} dplx? Let me compute dd in terms of d, so since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx )

But the negative just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is what matters. So N = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is N/(dplx) = 4π n / plx^4.

Which is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer is option A.

But wait, another approach: considering that the density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. Let's say we're considering a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance is from d=1/plx to d'=1/(plx + dplx). The volume between d and d' is (4/3)π (d'^3 - d^3).

Wait, so volume V = (4/3)π ( (1/(plx + dplx))^3 - (1/plx)^3 )

But for small dplx, we can approximate this as a differential. So the volume would be approximately 4π d^2 dd, which is the same as before. So same conclusion.

Alternatively, think in terms of the number of stars per unit of plx. So for a thin slice in plx, the number of stars is proportional to dN = 4π d^2 (dd), and since d = 1/plx, and dd = -d^2 dplx, substituting, dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ). So dN = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Again, dN is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since the number density of stars is constant, the number of stars in this shell is given by:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd,
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we have \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Differentiating \( d \) with respect to \( \text{plx} \), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), corresponding to option A.
