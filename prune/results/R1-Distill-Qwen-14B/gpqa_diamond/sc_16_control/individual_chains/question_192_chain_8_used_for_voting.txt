Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, and there's an angle θ between l and s.

Hmm. So I remember that when dealing with conductors and electric charges, there are some key concepts like electric fields inside and outside conductors, and how charges distribute themselves. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right! When you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to it. So, since the cavity has a charge +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, right? So yes, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, which is larger than R. So we need to find the electric field at P.

I remember that outside a conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point outside, the field is the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, no, because the setup is a bit more complicated. The cavity isn't at the center, it's offset by a distance s. So the +q is inside the cavity, which is not at the center of the conductor. So the induced charges won't be symmetrically placed because the cavity is off-center.

Wait a second, but the conductor is a sphere. Oh, but the cavity is not at the center but shifted. So the conductor is a shell with a cavity that's off-center. Hmm. That complicates things because the charges in the conductor's inner and outer surfaces would arrange themselves based on the charge distribution inside the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor is a conductor. So the charges on the inner surface will arrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material part, not the cavity) is zero. So the induced charges on the inner surface must produce an electric field that cancels the field due to the charge +q inside the cavity, within the conductor's material.

But the conductor is a spherical shell, but the cavity is not concentric. So how does that work?

Wait, maybe I should think about Gauss's law here. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges will move to the surfaces. The inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But since the cavity isn't centered, maybe the inner charges arrange themselves such that they are distributed in a way that produces a field inside the conductor (the region between R and the cavity's outer radius) that cancels the field from +q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the electric field inside the conducting material (the shell) must be zero. So the net field in the conductor's material must be zero. So the field due to the charge +q and the induced charges on the inner surface must sum to zero in that region.

But the problem is about a point outside the conductor. So point P is outside, so maybe the field there is due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which would be the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the outer surface has +q because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor itself is neutral. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, but the conductor is a spherical shell, but the cavity is off-center. So the outer surface's charge is +q but spread in a symmetric way around the sphere because the conductor is a sphere. Because the conductor being a sphere, the outer charge distribution is spherically symmetric, regardless of where the inner charge is.

Wait, yes, because the conductor is a shell and the outer surface is a sphere. So the outer charge +q will distribute uniformly on the outer surface, making the electric field outside the conductor as if the charge were at the center.

So for point P outside the conductor (L > R), the electric field depends only on the total charge outside that point. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field at P is due to +q, and it's as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. Oh, but the conductor's center is different from the cavity's center. So does that affect anything?

Wait, maybe not. Because the outer surface's charge is symmetric. So regardless of where the cavity is inside the conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. So the field outside the conductor would be as if the charge q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in the problem, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the distance l is from P to the center of the cavity. So perhaps the way the field works is that the +q is at the center of the cavity, which is offset by s from the center.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the field outside the conductor is determined by that +q, which is as if it's at the center. So the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, the options have other possibilities. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That's what I was thinking. But wait, another thought: the charge inside the cavity is +q, but the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero, but the outer surface is +q.

So when you're outside, the field is due to the +q charge on the outer surface, but it's as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

So that would be option B. But wait, but another part of the problem says that the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and there's an angle θ between l and s. So does that affect anything?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the field depends on the position of the charge inside the cavity relative to point P.

Wait, but outside the conductor, the field is due to the total enclosed charge. Since the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field outside should only depend on q and the distance from the center of the conductor. So the field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, but the inner cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge distribution that's like the negative of the cavity's charge, but the outer surface would have a uniform distribution because it's a sphere.

Wait, no, the inner surface's charge isn't uniform because the cavity is off-center. So the inner surface's charge would be more on the side closer to the cavity's center. But the outer surface's charge is on the conductor, which is a sphere, so it remains uniform. So the field outside the conductor is as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So yes, the field at point P is determined by the +q charge on the outer surface, leading to E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$). The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (adjacent to the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conducting material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: Outside the conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface is concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is due to the symmetry of the spherical outer surface, which ensures that the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform, regardless of the offset of the cavity.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: Since $P$ is outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor), the electric field at $P$ is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$. The field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This result is independent of the offset $s$ of the cavity or the angle $\theta$, as the outer surface charge distribution ensures spherical symmetry.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The dependence on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor, as the field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, not the cavity's position.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The field at $P$ is due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface, and the distance from $P$ to the center of the conductor is $L$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The dependence on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not applicable for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the field outside a spherical charge distribution depends on $1/l^2$, this does not apply here because $l$ is the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, not the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
