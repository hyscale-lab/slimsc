Okay, let me try to figure this chemistry problem out. Hmm, so it's about some reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of a product. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, so I'll need to think this through step by step.

The question talks about solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is C reacting with water to reform A and two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

So first, I need to figure out what these substances A, B, C, D, etc., could be. Let me try to break it down.

The first reaction: Solid A + 8 gas B → product C. 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 1:8 for A to B. So maybe A is something that reacts with B in an 8:1 molar ratio. What reactions involve such ratios? Maybe something like sulfuric acid formation? Or perhaps something like the synthesis of a nitride or something else.

Wait, bright red product. That makes me think of something like sulfur, but product C is produced from solid A and gas B. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound with a red color. Oh wait, maybe C is a metal oxide? Or perhaps a compound with a transition metal that has a red color.

Another thought: if C is a compound that reacts with water to form two acids, one strong and one weak. So, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. So C is acting like an acid or base, perhaps.

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or another salt. Wait, but when C reacts with D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. So D and C must form something dangerous.

Let me think about possible E. Extremely hazardous makes me think of something like sarin gas or other nerve agents, but perhaps more likely, it could be something like phosgene, or maybe a cyanide compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like NO or another toxic gas.

Wait, let me think about the reactions. Let me try to figure out the possible compounds.

Let me consider the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. So the ratio is 1:2 for C to D.

Wait, perhaps D is a gas that's a halogen, like Cl2 or F2. Because halogens often react in such ratios. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 or another diatomic gas.

Wait, the reaction between D and B in a 1:1 ratio forms H, which is a solvent. Solvents include things like water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Wait, D and B in 1:1 ratio make H, a solvent. D is a gas, so B must be a gas as well.

If D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a common solvent. Let me think: What gases could react in 1:1 to form a solvent? For example, if B is CO2 and D is something else. Or maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2? But that would make HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, water is a solvent. But H would be H2O. So if D is O2 and B is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Hmm. Wait, but H2O is a gas at high temperatures. Not sure.

Another approach: D reacts with B in 1:1 to make H, which is a solvent. So H could be something like ethanol, but then D and B would have to be something that makes ethanol. Not likely gases reacting.

Wait, maybe H is a diatomic molecule. Like H2O. So D and B could be H2 and O2. But again, their ratio in H2O is 2:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe H is NH3, but then B and D would be N2 and H2, which react in a 1:3 ratio (like in the Haber process). But the ratio here is 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4, but how would that form?

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe D is O2 and B is a gas that reacts with O2 to form H, which is a solvent. For example, if B is CH4, but I don't know if that makes sense.

Another thought: If H is a common solvent like ethanol, but how would that form? Maybe D is O2 and B is something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe H is CO2? No, that's a gas. Hmm.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me look at another part of the problem. The reaction where C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid. So, for example, if C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3, then upon hydrolysis, it might form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but that doesn't fit because Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Na3N, but when it reacts with water, it produces NH3 and NaOH, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is CuS, then reacting with water might produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a salt (C) reacts with water to form two different acids. So maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4. Then, NaHSO4 + H2O → NaOH + H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, and perhaps another acid? Hmm, but that doesn't produce two different acids. Alternatively, if C is something like Na2SO3, which would hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (weak) and NaOH (which is a base, not an acid). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a nitrate and a carbonate. Not sure.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again: A + 8 B → C. That makes me think of the Haber process for ammonia, but ammonia is a gas, not a bright red solid. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: the synthesis of nitric acid or another strong acid. For instance, in the production of HNO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide, and B is a diatomic gas like O2. So, solid metal oxide (A) reacts with O2 to form C, but I don't know how that would fit the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, solid metal (A) reacts with Cl2 (B) in a 1:8 ratio. Wait, what metals react with Cl2 in such a ratio? Maybe aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a certain ratio, but I'm not sure about 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2, and A is carbon. So 8 moles of O2 reacting with 1 mole of carbon (A) to form CO2 (C). But CO2 is a gas, not a bright red solid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be forming a compound like PbO2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a sulfide, and B is a halogen. For example, A is FeS, B is Cl2. FeS + Cl2 → FeCl3 and S. But I'm not sure about the ratio here.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, forming a chloride. For example, if A is Fe, B is Cl2 → FeCl3. But the ratio is 1 mole Fe to 3 moles Cl2. So 3 equivalents. But the question says 8 equivalents. So 8 moles of B per mole of A. So the formula would be A B8.

What elements have compounds with such a formula? Maybe something like Na (A) and O2 (B). 4 Na + O2 → 2 Na2O. But that's 4 Na to 1 O2, which is 4 equivalents, not 8. So 8 equivalents would be 1 Na to 8 O2? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe A is a metal with a high valency. For example, if A is a +2 metal. Then, to get 8 equivalents of B, which could be O2. So formula would be A O8. That's a bit unusual. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product E. It's extremely hazardous. So what are some extremely hazardous chemical compounds?

- Cyanide compounds are dangerous, but I don't know if E is a cyanide.
- Phosgene (COCl2) is very toxic.
- Certain nerve agents, but perhaps that's too specific.
- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is highly toxic.
- Maybe E is a sarin or VX gas, but perhaps that's beyond the scope.
- Alternatively, something like chlorine gas is dangerous, but it's a gas itself.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D. If E is phosgene, then C and D would need to be something that produces phosgene. Phosgene is O=CCl2. So to make phosgene, perhaps C is CO and D is Cl2. Then, CO + Cl2 → under certain conditions, maybe with a catalyst, forms phosgene. But the stoichiometry would be CO + Cl2 → COCl2. So 1:1 ratio. But the reaction given is C + 2 D → E. So 1 C to 2 D. So if C is CO and D is Cl2, then it would be CO + 2 Cl2 → something. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Wait, another possibility: C is a metal carbonyl. For example, maybe C is Fe(CO)5, but that's a liquid, not a solid.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions in reverse. Let me try to identify each compound.

Let me think about D. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's say H is water. Then, D + B → H2O. So if H is H2O, then D and B could be O2 and H2, but in a 1:1 ratio. But the formation of H2O from H2 and O2 is in a 2:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe H is another solvent, like ethanol. But then D and B would need to form ethanol. That seems unlikely with gases.

Alternatively, maybe H is a diatomic molecule. Like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. So perhaps H isn't H2O.

Wait, maybe H is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not making progress here. Let's think about other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: considering the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G. So, C is a salt that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. So, perhaps C is a sulfite, nitrite, or another similar compound.

Wait, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), then when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of two salts? Or perhaps C is a different kind of salt.

Alternatively, if C is something like sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4), then hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH. Again, one acid and one base, not two acids.

Hmm, tricky. Let's think of another scenario. What if C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it doesn't usually produce acids, but perhaps in some acidic conditions. Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, NaH2PO4. Reacting with water might produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze. NH4NO3 + H2O → NH4OH (which is NH3·H2O, a weak base) and HNO3 (strong acid). So again, one acid and one base.

Not matching the two acids part. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is an acetate salt, but that would produce a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (like NaOH). Still not two acids.

Another thought: perhaps C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces O2 and NaOH. Still not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. Reaction with water: it doesn't hydrolyze much, but perhaps in some cases produces H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH. Again, one acid and a base.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the first reaction again.

A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid). So, what solid, when formed from a solid and a gas in an 8:1 ratio, is bright red?

Wait, sulfur is bright red, but is it a product in such a reaction? Let me think. Sulfur can be formed from reactions like the decomposition of sulfites or sulfates. Alternatively, maybe A is FeS and B is O2. But I don't think that gives a red product.

Wait, perhaps A is CuO and B is S. But CuO + S in a reaction would produce CuS or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a sulfur vapor. For example, Fe + S → FeS. But FeS is black, not red.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the formation of a metal sulfide. For example, 8 equivalents of H2S reacting with a metal to form a sulfide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is carbon (solid) and B is O2. Then, 8 moles of O2 with 1 mole of C could form CO2 (C is carbon, B is O2). But CO2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving nitric acid. For example, concentrated nitric acid reacts with a metal to produce various products, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide and B is a more electronegative element, like Cl2. For example, Al2O3 + Cl2 → AlCl3. But the ratio is 2 Al2O3 + 6 Cl2 → 4 AlCl3. So that's 6 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of Al2O3. Not 8.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about product E. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. If D is Cl2 and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form a dangerous product, like phosgene (as I thought earlier), then E would be phosgene. Let me see: if C is CO (carbon monoxide) and D is Cl2, then CO + Cl2 → COCl2 (phosgene). But the reaction given is C + 2 D → E. So if C is CO, then 1 CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2? But that doesn't balance.

Wait, maybe C is something else. Suppose C is CH3Cl (methyl chloride), but I'm not sure how that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a thiol, and D is Cl2. Then, C could be reacting to form HCl and something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: maybe E is sarin gas. Sarin is (OPK), but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is hydrogen cyanide (HCN). How would that form? If C is NH3 and D is CN-? But D is a gas, so perhaps D is a gas that can produce CN-.

Wait, perhaps D is Cl2, and C is CH3Cl. Then, with Cl2, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl compound and D is a chloride. Let's say C is CO, D is Cl2. Then, CO + Cl2 → under certain conditions, maybe in the presence of a catalyst, forms phosgene (O=CCl2). So the reaction is CO + Cl2 → COCl2. But the stoichiometry in the problem is 1 C : 2 D → E. So that would be CO + 2 Cl2 → something. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is CO and D is Cl2, with 2 D per C, then perhaps forming CCl2O or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydroxide, but that doesn't seem right.

Another approach: D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's suppose H is ethanol. Then, D and B would have to be gases that combine to form ethanol. But how? Maybe B is H2 and D is C2H5OH? No, that's not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B would have to form NH3. So maybe B is N2 and D is H2. But N2 and H2 react in a 1:3 ratio (Haber process) to form NH3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is CO2. Then, D and B could be C and O2, but that's a 1:1 ratio. So B is O2 and D is C. Then, C (solid) + O2 (gas) → CO2 (gas). But CO2 is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about the possible structures of E.

If E is a molecule with a certain symmetry group, like D∞h or something else, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is a gas, not sure if that's E.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. But earlier I thought E is phosgene, which is O=CCl2, which is a linear molecule, so it would also have D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but another possibility: if E is something like SO2, which is bent, but D has D∞h symmetry? Wait, no, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry group. Because it has a central S atom with two double-bonded O atoms and a lone pair, giving a bent structure. So its symmetry group is D∞h? Or C2v?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the symmetry groups. Let me recall:

- A linear molecule (like O2, CO, HCN) has D∞h symmetry.
- A bent molecule like H2O or SO2 has C2v symmetry.
- A trigonal planar molecule (like BF3) has D3h symmetry.
- A tetrahedral molecule (like CH4) has Td symmetry.
- Etc.

So if E is a bent molecule like SO2, its symmetry group would be C2v (option D). If E is a linear molecule like CO2, it's D∞h (option C). If E is a diatomic like O2, it's D∞h (option C).

But according to the reaction C + 2D → E, and D is a gas, let's imagine D is Cl2. Then, if C is CO, the product would be COCl2 (phosgene), which is a linear molecule. So the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

Alternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is linear, symmetry group D∞h.

Wait, but the options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So if E is a linear molecule, the answer would be C) D∞h. If it's bent, like SO2, then D) C2v. But which is it?

Alternatively, let's think about another possibility. If E is something like H2O, but that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent like sarin, which has a more complex structure. But I'm not sure about the symmetry group of sarin.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the symmetry group of phosgene. Phosgene is O=CCl2, which is a linear molecule. The central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the structure is linear, making it D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is something else, like HCN, which is also linear, D∞h symmetry.

But wait, the reaction C + 2 D → E. If D is Cl2, and C is CO, then E is COCl2 (phosgene), which is linear.

So in that case, the molecular symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But another possibility: if E is something like CH3Cl (methyl chloride), which has a tetrahedral structure. Its symmetry group would be C2v? Or maybe another group. But methyl chloride has a central carbon with three Cl and one H attached, but wait, no. Wait, CH3Cl is a tetrahedral molecule, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group. Alternatively, if E is CCl2F2, which is a tetrahedral molecule, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, if E is something like Cl2O, which is a bent molecule, then its symmetry group would be C2v.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident, but I think the best fit is that E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E, based on the given reactions and properties of the substances involved. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Solid A + 8 Equivalents of Gas B → Bright Red Solid C**  
   - The reaction involves a 1:8 molar ratio of A to B, producing a bright red solid. This suggests that A and B are likely elements or simple compounds reacting to form a compound with a specific stoichiometry. The bright red color of C is significant, as it could indicate a compound like a metal sulfide or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2: C + 2 Equivalents of Gas D → Extremely Hazardous Product E**  
   - The reaction between C and D in a 1:2 molar ratio produces E, which is described as extremely hazardous. This suggests that E could be a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound. Possible candidates for E include phosgene (COCl₂), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or a nerve agent like sarin. These compounds are highly hazardous and have distinct molecular structures.

3. **Reaction 3: C + Water → A + Two Acids F and G**  
   - When C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids: F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if C were a sulfite or carbonate, it could hydrolyze to produce acids. However, the specific details of this reaction do not directly affect the determination of E's molecular symmetry.

4. **Reaction 4: D + B in a 1:1 Ratio → Solvent H**  
   - D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, and acetone. This reaction suggests that D and B are gases that combine to form a liquid or another solvent. For example, if B is H₂ and D is O₂, they could form H₂O (a solvent). However, the exact identity of H is not critical to determining E's symmetry.

5. **Molecular Symmetry of E**  
   - The question focuses on the molecular symmetry group of E. If E is a linear molecule (e.g., phosgene, HCN, or CO₂), it would belong to the **D∞h** symmetry group. If E is a bent molecule (e.g., SO₂ or H₂O), it would belong to the **C₂v** symmetry group. Based on the reactions and the description of E as extremely hazardous, the most likely candidate for E is a linear molecule like phosgene (COCl₂), which has **D∞h** symmetry.

Given the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

**Answer: C**
