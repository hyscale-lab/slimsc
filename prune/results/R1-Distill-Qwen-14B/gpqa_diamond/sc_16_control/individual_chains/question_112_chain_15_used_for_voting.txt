Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So, the question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. They mention an operator with a specific matrix representation, and I need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate and the average value of that operator.

First, I need to figure out the state |alpha>. It's given as proportional, so I should normalize it. The general form for a two-level system is a|up> + b|down>, where |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Given a = (1+i), b = (2-i). Let's compute |a|² and |b|².

|a|² = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.

|b|² = (2-i)(2+i) = (4 +1) =5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, actually, wait. The original vector is (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down>. So to normalize, we need to divide by the square root of 7, as 2+5=7. So the normalized |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, we're considering an operator whose matrix representation A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So in a two-level basis, this would be a 2x2 matrix. Let's write it out.

For a two-level system, the basis is |up> and |down>. So the matrix A would have:

A_11 = 0, A_12 = ħ/2,

A_21 = ħ/2, A_22 =0.

So A looks like:

[ 0,   ħ/2 ]

[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm. Wait, but what's the operator? Because in quantum mechanics, the operator's matrix elements are for the eigenstates of the basis. So in this case, this matrix is for which basis? I think it's the same basis as our state, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of spin. But the operator A is a different operator, maybe the x-component or something else.

But wait, the problem says: "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." So we have to find the eigenstates of A. Because the question is about measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator.

Wait, no, no. The question says: "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij..." So the operator's eigenstates are the possible measurement outcomes, and |alpha> is expressed in the original basis (z-basis), so perhaps we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. Let me compute its eigenstates. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in that operator's eigenbasis.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]

[ ħ/2 0 ]

To find eigenvalues, solve det(A - λ I) =0.

So determinant:

(0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0

Which is λ² - (ħ²/4) =0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the corresponding eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[-ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

[ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]

Which is:

-ħ/2 (1, -1) as the rows.

So the eigenvector must satisfy (A - λ I) v =0 → (A - (ħ/2) I) v =0.

So the equations:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,1). But to make it a unit vector, normalize.

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2:

(A + ħ/2 I) v =0 → matrix is:

[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

So the equations:

(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait wait, but hang on. The way the eigenvectors are expressed in the original basis is:

For λ=ħ/2: v1 = v2 → |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

For λ=-ħ/2: v1 = -v2 → |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So the eigenstates of A are these |+> and |->.

So the state |alpha> is in the |up>, |down> basis. To find the probabilities of measuring +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->

We can compute c_+ and c_- by taking inner products.

c_+ = < + | alpha >

c_- = < - | alpha >

So let's compute these.

First, |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Expressed in the |+>, |-> basis.

Compute c_+:

< + | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2) , 1/sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, no. Let me be precise. Let me write |+> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so < + | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So < + | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ]

Wait, because:

< + | alpha > = [ 1/sqrt(2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * <up|up> + [ 1/sqrt(2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * <down|down>

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(2*7)

Simplify numerator:

(1 +i + 2 -i ) = 3.

So c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so < - | is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So c_- = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) - ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

Simplify numerator:

1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i )

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, let me make sure: [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

Yes.

So c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, but for probabilities, we need the squared magnitudes of these coefficients.

So |c_+|² = (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 or 0.64.

|c_-|² = | (-1 +2i) |² /14 → sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 )^2 = (1 +4 )=5 → 5/14≈0.357.

But wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is about 0.64 as in option A. But option A also says average value hbar/7. So I should check that.

Wait, the average value of the operator A is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, what is the operator A in matrix form? It's the given matrix:

[0, ħ/2 ]

[ ħ/2, 0 ]

So in the original basis, which is the same as the |up> and |down> basis.

So to compute the expectation value <A>, we can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me compute it.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So compute <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * |alpha>.

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So let me compute A |alpha>.

A |alpha> = [ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute each component:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) * ħ/(2 * 7 )

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i ) * ħ/(2 *7 )

So let's compute (1 -i)(2 -i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)

= 2 -i -2i + i^2

= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)

= 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i

= 2 + 2i +i + i²

= 2 +3i -1

= 1 +3i.

So sum of the two terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i )= 2.

Multiply by ħ/(2*7) → 2 * ħ/(14) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are |c_+|² =9/14 ≈0.6428, |c_-|²=5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which rounds to 0.64, which matches option A.

Option A's average is hbar/7, which we got.

So that would make the correct answer option A.

Wait, but looking again, the options also include 3ħ/sqrt(7) and others. Wait, but the average is ħ/7, which is option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, approximately 0.64 and 0.36 (since 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded).

So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start with the given state of the electron:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle,
\]

which is already normalized since \(|1+i|^2 = 2\) and \(|2-i|^2 = 5\), giving a total squared magnitude of \(2 + 5 = 7\).

The operator \(A\) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(A\) are found by solving \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+\rangle\) and \(|-\rangle\), we express \(|\alpha\rangle\) in terms of these eigenstates:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients \(c_+\) and \(c_-\) are computed as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, the average value of the operator \(A\) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \(A\) and the coefficients of \(|\alpha\rangle\), the calculation yields:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- The probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\).
- The average value is \(\hbar / 7\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
