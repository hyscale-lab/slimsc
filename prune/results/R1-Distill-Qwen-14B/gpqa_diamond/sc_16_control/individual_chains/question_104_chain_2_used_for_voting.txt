Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the main difference seems to be the RV shifts they cause. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but how does the RV shift relate to the planet's orbital period? I think the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula might be K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) ) — but wait, that's probably more complicated than needed. Since the question says the planets are similar to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun, maybe M_planet << M_star. So M_planet can be approximated as much smaller than the star's mass. So then, the equation simplifies.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2πG) / (P * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ), but since e is zero for circular orbits, that part is 1. So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) because other constants are involved.

Wait, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 day in seconds)) )

But since M_planet << M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ (G * M_planet * sin i )^(1/3) / ( (M_star^(2/3) ) * (P^(1/3) * (1 day in seconds) ) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Probably better to think about the relation between K and the orbital period. Since the stars are identical and the planets have similar masses, the main factors affecting K are the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_planet is the same for both planets. The stars have the same mass. So the only variable here is the orbital period. How does K relate to P?

The formula for K can be written as:

K = ( (v) ) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / (c * (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 / P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I think I'm mixing constants. Let me try to rearrange the formula correctly.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (27 * π ) / (8 * c^3 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (G^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But again, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ (constant) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because when P increases, K decreases. So if planet #2 has a higher K than planet #1, that would mean P is shorter for planet #2, but wait that doesn't make sense. Wait, let's see:

Wait, no. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K = constant * (1 / P^(1/3)). So if P increases, K decreases. So if Planet #2's K is 7 milliangstrom and Planet #1's is 5, then K2 > K1, so P2 must be smaller than P1? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means smaller P.

Wait, but the question asks, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So P2 = ? * P1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. From K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)), so P ∝ (1/K^(3)).

Wait, no. Let's write the relationship properly.

If K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then K ∝ P^(-1/3). So if K2 is 7 and K1 is 5, then K2 = (7/5) K1.

But K1 = (1/(P1^(1/3))) * constant.

So K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * constant.

So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

So K2 / K1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1 / P2.

So 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) P1.

Compute 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1 by that factor. So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → which would mean P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364. So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning it's shorter, so the period of P2 is shorter. So the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1? The answer would be 0.36 times, so it's shorter.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't invert anything. Let me recheck.

We have K2/K1 = 7/5. And since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). So solving for P2: P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^(3). Because (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me rederive:

We have K = (constant) / (P^(1/3)).

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3).

K2 = C / P2^(1/3).

Divide K2 by K1:

K2/K1 = (C/P2^(1/3)) / (C/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Cubing both sides: (343/125) = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That's P2/P1 = 0.364. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The RV semi-amplitude, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for a given planet-star system. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the only variable affecting the RV semi-amplitude is the orbital period. For Planet #1, the RV shift is 5 milliangstrom, and for Planet #2, it is 7 milliangstrom. Since \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), the ratio of the periods can be derived as:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( K_2 = 7 \) and \( K_1 = 5 \):

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{343}{125} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Solving for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{125}{343} \approx P_1 \cdot 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the ratio \( P_2 / P_1 \) is approximately 0.36.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
