Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond between two cyclohexane rings. The target molecule is a bit more complex: it has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is then connected to another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent where position 1 has a group that's a cyclohexyl with a hydroxymethyl attached. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group. Hmm, perhaps the carbon chain is CH2(OH)CH2 connected to another cyclohexane ring? Or maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group which is also attached to another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. I might need to clarify that.

But regardless, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is two cyclohexane rings connected by a triple bond. So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-cyclohexane. 

So, to get from that to the target, I need to modify the triple bond. One approach with triple bonds is to perform some kind of alkyne addition or functionalization. Let me think about possible reactions.

The target molecule seems to have a carbonyl group, since it's a carbaldehyde. So, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a methyl group, which suggests that maybe a dihydroxylation or some addition is happening.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being used to form a cyclopropane ring, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another approach: Ethynylcyclohexane could undergo some kind of cyclopropanation, but I don't think that's the case here. Or, perhaps it's about adding substituents to the triple bond.

Wait, maybe we should think about using a deprotonation and alkylation. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonating compounds. Maybe the triple bond is deprotonated, and then an alkylation occurs.

Looking at the options, the first step in options A, B, C, D is NaNH2 and some compound. So in option A, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So that would be deprotonating the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride—wait, no, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. Wait, no, NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to make an acetylide, and then methyl chloride would be an alkylating agent. But methyl chloride is a good methylating agent, but perhaps this would result in adding a methyl group to the acetylide.

Wait, consider the structure of ethynylcyclohexane. It's cyclohexane-C≡C-cyclohexane. Deprotonating the triple bond (but wait, is it acidic enough? Acetylenes are more acidic than alkanes but less than alcohols. At room temp, maybe NaNH2 would deprotonate it because it's a strong base. So, the deprotonation would give a lithium acetylide, or maybe sodium. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group to one end.

Wait, but after that, what happens next? Let's think about each option.

Looking at option A: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated, but wait, after adding a methyl group, perhaps the triple bond would become a single bond with two substituents.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has two cyclohexane rings on the triple bond. If we deprotonate and add a methyl group, we'll have a structure like cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is between two cyclohexanes, so adding a methyl to one end would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe it's attached to the acetylide.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The starting compound is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-ethynyl-cyclohexane. If we deprotonate the triple bond, we get a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, treating with methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group to the end. So, the triple bond would then be between cyclohexane and a methyl group?

Wait, no. The triple bond is between two cyclohexane groups. Deprotonation would give a lithium acetylide, which is an sp-hybridized carbon with a negative charge. Adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, after step 1, perhaps we have cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, wait, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group. So after alkylation, the triple bond would be between cyclohexane and a methyl group attached to another carbon? Wait, maybe I'm not getting it. Let me imagine:

The starting molecule is cyclohexane-C≡C-cyclohexane. Deprotonate one end, add methyl chloride, which would add a methyl group to that end. So now, the triple bond becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, in step 2, H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So that would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically goes triple to single via addition of H2. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait no, hydrogenation of triple to single would add two H's. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait: when you hydrogenate an alkyne to an alkane, you're adding two H's across the triple bond. So, the triple bond would become a single bond with two H's added. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-cyclohexane? No, because the other end was a cyclohexane. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is between two cyclohexanes. So, C≡C is between cyclohexane groups. When you deprotonate and add a methyl group, you're adding to one of the triple bond carbons, making it CH2Cl or something. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to form an alkyne. Wait, no. The starting material is an alkyne. So, step one is NaNH2 and methyl chloride: deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylation with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes CH2Cl on one end? No, wait, methyl chloride would be (CH3)Cl, so the acetylide would attack, giving a new carbon. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or CH3 group? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents. NaNH2 is a strong base, used to deprotonate compounds. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent, so the acetylide would react with it to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, after step 1 in option A, the structure would have a methyl group added to one end of the triple bond. So, the triple bond would be between cyclohexane and a methyl group. Then step 2 is H2 with Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that doesn't fit the target. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl and another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is hydrogenation but under different conditions. Maybe it's partial hydrogenation to a cis or trans double bond. But no, H2/Pd typically goes all the way to single bond.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is connected to another cyclohexane with a formyl (CHO) group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the main structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexane. And that same carbon (position 1) has a formyl group attached.

Wait, that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, perhaps the structure is more like:

O==C-CH2-C(OH)H-cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexyl-(hydroxymethyl) group. So, the substituent is a -CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexane, and that is connected to the main cyclohexane ring.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about the steps needed to form this structure.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we need to add substituents and then functionalize.

One approach could be:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a substituent.
2. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond.
3. Oxidation to introduce a carbonyl group.
4. Another reaction to introduce a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but that might not fit. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone via oxymercuration or another method.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a methyl group, which might suggest that there's a diol formed, then perhaps protected or oxidized.

Hmm, another approach: the triple bond is converted into a ketone. So, for example, via a hydroxylation followed by oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically results in breaking the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if we have ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyls.

But in the target molecule, there's only one formyl group. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reagents in the options involve ozonolysis. Looking at the options, option C and D have O3 in their steps. Let's see:

Option C: steps 3 and 4 are O3 with (CH3)2S and Ba(OH)2.

Option D: step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, step 4 is NH4OH.

Wait, O3 is used in ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a triple bond typically cleaves the triple bond and forms carbonyl groups. So, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would break the triple bond, giving two carbonyl groups. But then, each end would have a carbonyl. But the target has a single formyl group, so perhaps one of the carbonyls is further modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans double bond, then subjected to some dihydroxylation.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methylCl; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation? Or maybe for elimination. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction or other eliminations.

Wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, perhaps for forming ketones or other oxidations. Alternatively, maybe it's used in elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from alcohols.

Alternatively, the reagent H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to carboxylic acids. Wait, no, Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4) oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, secondary to ketones, and tertiary alcohols don't react. But in option A, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is more of a mercury-based oxidation, perhaps for oxidizing alkenes to diols, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option A is NaNH2 and methylCl leading to alkylation, then H2/Pd hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, then Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination to form a double bond, and then oxidation.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about option D: steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and liquid NH3, then O3 and (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol might be for deprotonation and alkylation. Methanol is a methylating agent, so perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then treated with methanol to add a methyl group.

Then, Li and liquid NH3 is a condition for the formation of Grignard reagents. Wait, no, Li in NH3 is for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form strong bases. Alternatively, maybe it's for elimination reactions.

Wait, but wait: after adding a methyl group, the molecule would have a structure like cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, if treated with Li/NH3, perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a lithium acetylide again, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the second step in option D is a reduction. Li in NH3 is used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but maybe in this case, it's for hydrogenating a triple bond? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, so maybe we need an oxidation step. Ozonolysis (O3) is an option for that.

Wait, let's think of another approach. Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated to add a substituent, then the triple bond is hydrogenated, then something else happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a cyclopropane ring via a [2+2] cycloaddition? But that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is connected to another cyclohexane with a formyl group.

So, maybe the synthesis involves forming a diol from the triple bond, then protecting and oxidizing.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via oxymercuration, but that's for alkenes, not alkynes. Oxymercuration uses Hg(OAc)2 and then a reducing agent.

Wait, but the ozone would cleave the triple bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think: if we take ethynylcyclohexane and perform ozonolysis (O3), it would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, each cyclohexane ring would have a carbonyl group. But in the target, there's only one formyl group. Hmm, maybe one of the carbonyls is further reduced.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which suggests a formyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps ozonolysis would give two ketone groups, which could be reduced to aldehydes, but that would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to dihydroxylation, then some steps to form the desired structure.

Wait, let's consider the steps in option D.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. That would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Methanol would provide a methyl group. So, the product after step 1 would be a methyl-substituted acetylide. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Hmm, perhaps this is for the formation of a Grignard reagent. Wait, but Grignard reagents are usually formed from alkyl halides. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be for Birch reduction, but that usually applies to aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination to form an alkyne again? I'm not sure.

Wait, step 3 in option D is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup for ozonolysis. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for further reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the triple bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups, which would then be processed further.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and how they could lead to the target.

Let me go step by step for each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methylCl: deprotonate alkyne, alkylation to add methyl group.
Structure after step1: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. The starting structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-cyclohexane. After step 1, one end becomes CH3. So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add H's to the triple bond, converting it into cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't have the cyclohexane on the other end, which was the starting point.

Wait, no. Because the triple bond was between two cyclohexanes, after adding a methyl to one end, it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would make it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's not a ring anymore on one end. I'm probably not on the right track.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethylCl: deprotonate alkyne, then ethylation. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps this is for Birch reduction, but I don't see how that would apply here.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis, which would cleave the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, each end would have a carbonyl. So, we'd get two ketones, perhaps.

4. NH4OH: ammonium hydroxide, maybe for workup.

But the target has a formyl group, so that would fit if one of the carbonyls is an aldehyde. But wait, after ozonolysis of an alkyne, each end becomes a carbonyl. So, if the starting alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane (two cyclohexane rings), adding ethyl would make one end a cyclohexane and the other end a propanal (CH2CH2CHO?), but I'm not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methylCl: same as before, alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation, but maybe under different conditions. H2/Pd-CaCO3 is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but perhaps this step is for reducing the triple bond.

So, after step 2: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the target.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with (CH3)2S, which is a reagent that prevents the formation of ozonides into ketones or aldehydes, instead breaking them into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if the structure after step 2 is a single bond, perhaps it's a single bond between two CH2 groups. Then ozonolysis wouldn't have any triple bond to act on. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe option C isn't the right path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: deprotonate the alkyne, then react with methanol. So, the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps adds a methyl group.

Wait, no. Methanol is CH3OH. When an acetylide reacts with an alcohol, perhaps it forms an alkyne with an ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, actually, when an acetylide (like Na acetylide) reacts with MeOH, it would form an alkoxide, which upon protonation would give a substituted alkyne.

So, after step 1, the structure would be cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3?

No, wait. Acetylide + methanol would give a secondary alcohol? Or perhaps a substitution where the MeOH acts as an electrophile.

Wait, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methanol, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkylation, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not sure about that.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is typically used for Birch reductions, which reduce aromatic rings. But the molecule at this point may not have any aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, another thought: Li in NH3 is a condition for the formation of Grignard reagents. But Grignards are typically formed from alkyl halides, not alkyne derivatives. So perhaps this step is for deprotonating a triple bond again? Not sure.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis followed by a reductive workup with (CH3)2S. This would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups or aldehydes.

But wait, in option D, after step 2, the structure might have a double bond. How?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination reaction, forming a double bond.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 can also be used for elimination reactions, perhaps converting a triple bond into a double bond via dehydrohalogenation, but without a halide, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for a reduction, but I'm not sure.

Step 4: NH4OH. Maybe a workup step, or for converting a carbonyl into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are:

1. Alkyne deprotonated, then methylated.

2. Another reaction to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to think about the target molecule and the possible steps again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent is a hydroxymethyl attached to a cyclohexane, which is then attached to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Perhaps the synthesis involves:

- First, adding a methyl group to one end of the ethynylcyclohexane.

- Then, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, giving a structure where one end is a methyl group.

- Then, introducing a hydroxyl group adjacent to the methyl, perhaps via oxidation of a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but how to get the hydroxyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Reduction to introduce a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding a methyl group, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Then, dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) would add two hydroxyl groups across the double bond, forming a vicinal diol. Then, perhaps one hydroxyl is oxidized to a carbonyl.

But looking at the options, I don't see OsO4 in any of them. Instead, some options have O3.

Wait, let's go back to the target. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is then connected to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So the substituent is -CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a formyl group.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Introducing a hydroxyl group adjacent to the methyl via some oxidation.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C or D because they involve ozonolysis, which would break the triple bond into carbonyls.

So, let's consider option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methylCl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that structure doesn't have any rings connected anymore, which might not help in forming the target.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But H2/Pd typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds.

Hmm.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an alkoxy group on the triple bond.

Step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → maybe deprotonates and eliminates to form a double bond.

Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → maybe for workup, forming aldehydes.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests that perhaps one of the carbonyl groups is reduced to a primary alcohol. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one carbonyl is further modified.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have two carbonyl groups. Then, one is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the other is left as a formyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave into carbonyls.

4. Reduction of one carbonyl to a primary alcohol.

But looking at the options, option C includes Ba(OH)2 in step 3, which might be for elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols or in elimination reactions. For example, in the presence of an alcohol, Ba(OH)2 can help eliminate to form an alkene.

So, if after step 2 in option C, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which might not do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and ethylation → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Hydrogenation → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → cleavage into two carbonyls.

4. Workup to form aldehydes.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, so maybe one of the carbonyls is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and then perhaps further reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the alkyne is converted to a trans-alkene via hydrogenation, then dihydroxylation to form a diol, then oxidation of one hydroxyl to a carbonyl.

But none of the options seem to include dihydroxylation steps, which usually involve OsO4 or other reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me think:

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → forms a methylated acetylide.

2. Li, NH3 → perhaps forms a Grignard-like reagent.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and methylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Oxidize to form a carbonyl.

4. Reduce the carbonyl to a primary alcohol.

But I don't see an option that fits exactly.

Wait, looking again at the target, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is then attached to another cyclohexane with a formyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed from a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2OH group, which is connected to a methyl group that's further oxidized to a formyl.

So, the steps could be:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a CH2 group.

3. Oxidize the CH2 to a carbonyl (CHO).

But then, where does the hydroxymethyl group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, the structure is a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2CH3 group. Then, perhaps oxidation would form a ketone, but that doesn't fit the target.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should compare the options and see which sequence makes the most sense.

Option C: Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which might cause elimination to form a double bond. Then, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is a Jones oxidation condition. So, perhaps after elimination, the molecule has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis (but step 3 in C has Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, etc.), perhaps it's for oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has a hydroxymethyl group. Perhaps that comes from a Grignard reaction. But Grignard reagents are usually formed from alkyl halides.

Wait, option D has Li in NH3, which could be for forming a Grignard reagent if there's an alkyl halide. But after step 1, if the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3, perhaps step 2 is converting that to a Grignard.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in D is for deprotonating to form a strong base, which then abstracts a proton elsewhere to form a double bond.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the possible answers and their reagents leading to the target.

Wait, the target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a formyl group via ozonolysis, and another part is functionalized into a hydroxymethyl group.

Option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → maybe adds a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, no, methanol is CH3OH. So, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne becomes CH2-OCH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonation to form a strong base, or elimination to form a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → perhaps for workup, forming aldehydes or other groups.

But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer involves:

- Adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

- Hydrogenating to a single bond.

- Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

- Then, introducing a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing which option does that.

Wait, looking at option C again:

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which gives aldehydes or ketones.

So, if the triple bond is converted into two carbonyl groups, and then one is further modified.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests a primary alcohol adjacent to a CH2 group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → add a methyl group.

2. Li and NH3 → form a Grignard reagent.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave any double bonds into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not connecting the steps to the target.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is used to form a cyclopropane ring via [2+1] addition, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a propargyl alcohol, which can then be oxidized.

But none of the options seem to include that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of a formyl group in the target. Since the target has a formyl group, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, in the steps, perhaps an oxidation step is present, like Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4) which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe under milder conditions, it could stop at the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which might be a mercury-based oxidation, perhaps similar to the Stephen reduction or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild oxidizing agent, perhaps for oxidizing primary alcohols to aldehydes.

So, if after some steps, there's a primary alcohol, then NH4OH could oxidize it to an aldehyde.

Putting it all together, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate alkyne and add methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. Introduce a hydroxyl group adjacent to the methyl.

4. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But which option does this?

Looking back, option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe add a methyl group or an ether.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps form a Grignard and then quench to form an alcohol.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleave any double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → oxidize primary alcohol to aldehyde.

So, if after step 2, we have an alcohol next to a carbonyl, step 4 would oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols. If the structure after step 2 in option C is a secondary alcohol, Ba(OH)2 might oxidize it to a ketone.

But I'm not seeing how that would lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D: after adding a methyl group, forming a Grignard, then ozonolysis to form carbonyls, then workup.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Given the time I've spent, I think I need to make an educated guess.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests that ozonolysis (which forms carbonyls) might be involved. So options C and D include ozonolysis steps.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which could oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, let's imagine:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methanol → forms a methyl-substituted acetylide, which upon workup gives cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3.

Wait, no. Acetylide plus methanol would form a compound like CH3-O-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Not sure what that does. Maybe deprotonates something else.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 forms a double bond via elimination.

Then, step 3: O3 cleaves the double bond into carbonyls. For example, if it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-cyclohexane with a double bond, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls.

Then, step 4: NH4OH could reduce one carbonyl to an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which could come from a Grignard reaction. If after forming a ketone, a Grignard adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol, which could then be oxidized.

But none of the options seem to include that.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group, which could come from the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options:

Option B's step 4 is NH4OH, perhaps for oxidation.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which could oxidize an alcohol to an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which involves ozonolysis with (CH3)2S and then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or for epoxide opening.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C.

To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves understanding the transformations required to achieve the target molecule. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring, and a formyl group (aldehyde) on the same carbon.

### Key Transformations Needed:
1. **Alkyne Functionalization**: The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, has a triple bond between two cyclohexane rings. This triple bond must be modified to introduce the desired substituents.
2. **Introduction of a Hydroxymethyl Group**: A hydroxymethyl group (-CH(OH)) must be introduced on one of the cyclohexane rings.
3. **Formation of a Formyl Group**: One of the carbons must be oxidized to a formyl group (-CHO) to complete the structure.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this step would introduce the hydroxymethyl group.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation conditions, which oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or secondary alcohols to ketones. However, this sequence does not clearly lead to the desired hydroxymethyl and formyl groups.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or reduction, but the role of this step in forming the target molecule is unclear.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the triple bond into carbonyl groups. However, this step does not align with the need to introduce a hydroxymethyl group.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild oxidizing agent, but it is unclear how this step would produce the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partially hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond, forming cyclohexane-CH=CH-CH₃.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups. This step could produce aldehydes or ketones, aligning with the need for a formyl group.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation, but its role in forming the hydroxymethyl group is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methoxy group, resulting in cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or reduction, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves any double bonds into carbonyl groups, which could produce aldehydes or ketones.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild oxidizing agent that could oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. This step aligns with the formation of the formyl group.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most plausible sequence. The steps involve alkyne functionalization, partial hydrogenation to a double bond, ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and potential oxidation or elimination to introduce the hydroxymethyl group and formyl group. While some steps are ambiguous, this option aligns most closely with the transformations needed to synthesize the target molecule.
