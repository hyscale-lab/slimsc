Okay, I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH of the solution. The problem gives me the masses of each salt, and I know their molar masses. I need to calculate their concentrations and figure out how they affect the orthophosphate ion concentration.

Wait, the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So first, I should find the number of moles of each compound. For KH2PO4, the molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g divided by that is... let me calculate. 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 moles. And for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005623 moles.

Now, each of these salts dissociates in water. KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^- K+) will dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution.

Phosphate has several species: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-. The given K_a values are for H3PO4 losing protons. So Ka1 is for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-; Ka2 is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-; Ka3 is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

In this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which suggests that the solution is a buffer. The phosphate ions might be in equilibrium, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-? Or wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in this solution, the species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the fully protonated form. In solution, especially when it's dissolved in water, it's more likely that H3PO4 is dissociated. But perhaps under these conditions, the orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or H2PO4^-? Let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the orthophosphate ion would be H3PO4^−, which is H2PO4^-? Or is the orthophosphate ion HPO4^2-? I'm a bit confused about the terminology. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- (which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion?), but I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, maybe "orthophosphate" refers to the HPO4^2- form. Or maybe the concentration of all phosphate species, but the question specifically says orthophosphate. Hmm, I should clarify.

Wait, the term orthophosphate usually refers to the H3PO4 species, but that's not present in solution as it tends to dissociate. Alternatively, sometimes the different forms are called ortho, meta, etc., but I think I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the term ortho refers to the H2PO4^- ion. I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think again. The problem provides the three K_a values for H3PO4. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

So, in solution, the species from KH2PO4 is H2PO4^-, and from Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's HPO4^2-. So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate could mean the H3PO4 form, but it's not present here. Alternatively, perhaps it's the HPO4^2- which is the orthophosphate ion. Or maybe the question is asking about the sum of all phosphate species, but that's not what the options suggest.

Wait, another approach: if both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the solution is a buffer between the first and second dissociation steps. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution". So I'm thinking that orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's not present. Alternatively, maybe it's the HPO4^2- form.

Wait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Maybe orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? Because when you have NaH2PO4, which is H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4, which is HPO4^2-, the HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which could be called orthophosphate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the "orthophosphate" is the H2PO4^- ion. I'm a bit unsure, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but then the problem gives both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, which are in equilibrium. So the concentration of each can be determined based on the pH, which we can calculate.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, how can we find the concentration of each species? Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at a pH where HPO4^2- is the major species, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a buffer solution, and we can use their concentrations to find the pH, which would then allow us to find the concentration of each species.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think: when you have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in solution, their dissociations are:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution, the solution is a buffer between the first and second dissociation steps of H3PO4.

So, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, the equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, in this case, the concentrations are from the moles of each salt divided by the volume. So I can calculate [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-].

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007337 mol. Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005623 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005623 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028115 M

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028115 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.766.

Take log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) inverse, so pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH ≈ 7.207 + (-0.114) ≈ 7.093.

Wait, but how does this help me find the concentration of orthophosphate ions? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, and we're to find its concentration, but that's already given as 0.028115 M. But that's just the concentration from the salt. But wait, in solution, the actual concentration would be affected by the pH because H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2- and vice versa.

Wait, no. Because the salts fully dissociate, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- before considering any reactions are as calculated. But in reality, these species can interconvert based on pH. So the actual concentrations might not be exactly those values because the solution's pH affects their distribution.

Wait, but given that the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium. So the ratio of their concentrations is determined by the pH, which we calculated using the Henderson equation.

Wait, but perhaps I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- under the given conditions. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the concentration of HPO4^2- which is part of the buffer.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains both these salts, so the initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.036685 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028115 M. But in solution, these will interconvert, so the actual concentrations will change slightly based on the pH.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH as 7.093, which is between the pKa2 (7.207) and pKa1 (which is around 2.12, since Ka1 is 7.5e-3 → pKa1 ≈ 2.12). So the pH is around 7.09, which is just below pKa2. So the H2PO4^- is the predominant form, but some HPO4^2- is present.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then perhaps the concentration is calculated considering the buffer effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the total phosphate concentration, but the options don't suggest that. Let's think again.

Alternatively, maybe the orthophosphate ion is H3PO4, but that's not present because it's a weak acid and dissociates.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate refers to the H2PO4^- ion. So the concentration of H2PO4^- would be 0.036685 M, but that's not one of the options. The options are all around 1e-7 M, which is much lower.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer, and I can calculate the pH, then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is not asking for pH, but the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be found via their ratio. Using the Henderson equation, since we have pH, we can find the ratio.

Wait, but I have their initial concentrations. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is 7.09, and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found based on that.

But how?

Wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). So we can rearrange it to find the ratio.

We have pH = 7.093, pKa2=7.207. So 7.093 = 7.207 + log(ratio). So log(ratio) = -0.114. So ratio is 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.766.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.766 * [H2PO4^-].

But wait, but the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028115 M.

So the sum of the concentrations is 0.036685 + 0.028115 = 0.0648 M. Let me denote this sum as C_total = [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0648 M.

From the Henderson equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.766.

Let me set [HPO4^2-] = 0.766 [H2PO4^-].

So substituting into C_total: [H2PO4^-] + 0.766 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0648 M → [H2PO4^-] (1 + 0.766) = 0.0648 → [H2PO4^-] = 0.0648 / 1.766 ≈ 0.03665 M.

Which matches our initial [H2PO4^-], so I guess that's consistent. Therefore, [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.0281 M. But that's not matching the answer options which are ~1e-7 M.

Hmm, this doesn't make sense. There's a disconnect here. The concentrations I'm calculating are in the 0.03 M range, but the options are much smaller (like 1e-7 M). So either I've misunderstood the question, or perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Wait a minute. Wait, maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- (the orthophosphate ion), but that's not likely because PO4^3- would be the most deprotonated form, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the free orthophosphate ion, which would be H3PO4, but that's not present in solution because it's a weak acid and would dissociate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- that comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, and in solution, it can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But the third dissociation is very small, with Ka3=1.8e-12. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. But the question isn't about PO4^3-.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Each of these salts contributes H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively. The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Maybe orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. So the concentration is simply the moles of Na2HPO4 divided by the volume. Which is 0.005623 moles / 0.2 L = 0.028115 M. But that's 2.8e-2 M, which isn't among the options. The options are all about 1e-7 M.

Wait, this can't be right. I must be missing something. Maybe the orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's negligible in solution. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- (which is extremely low) but that's not matching the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- under the given conditions, considering the buffer. But that doesn't align with the answer options.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, which would be the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and PO4^3- concentrations. But again, the sum would be around 0.0648 M, which is much higher than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Another idea: maybe the solution undergoes hydrolysis, and the phosphate ions contribute to the pH, but the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- under the actual pH conditions of the solution.

Wait, but then again, how does that lead to 1e-7 M? That seems way too low.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Let me think: the third dissociation step is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-, with Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the Ka3 and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's say that in the buffer solution, the pH is about 7.09. So the H+ concentration is 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

For the third dissociation: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers: Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028115 M, [H+] = 8.2e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028115) / 8.2e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028115 ≈ 5.06e-14.

Divide by 8.2e-8: 5.06e-14 / 8.2e-8 ≈ 6.17e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.2e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's pretty close.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is about 6.2e-7 M, which is option A. But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, then this would make sense.

But earlier I thought orthophosphate was HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's not present. Alternatively, the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, and the question is about its concentration.

So, according to this calculation, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

But wait, in the problem statement, the given options have a range from ~2e-7 to ~4e-7. Wait, no, option A is 6.24e-7, which is the value I calculated. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But let me double-check the calculation.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028115 M? No, wait, because in the buffer solution, the actual [HPO4^2-] is less than the initial concentration because some has converted to H2PO4^-.

Wait, earlier we calculated that the actual [HPO4^2-] is 0.028115 M * (0.766) / (1 + 0.766) → wait no, because the Henderson equation gives the ratio as [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.766. So [HPO4^2-] = 0.766 * [H2PO4^-].

But the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] is (1 + 0.766) * [H2PO4^-] = 0.0648 M → [H2PO4^-] = 0.0648 / 1.766 ≈ 0.03665 M, and [HPO4^2-] = 0.0281 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.0281 M, and the pH is 7.093, so [H+] is about 8.2e-8.

Thus, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.2e-8.

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0281 = 5.058e-14.

Divided by 8.2e-8: 5.058e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.058 / 8.2) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.617 * 1e-6 = 6.17e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.17e-7 M, matching option A's 6.24e-7 M. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, why would the question refer to orthophosphate as PO4^3-? Because I thought orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, and the concentration is given by the buffer solution's ratio.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the buffer, the concentration of HPO4^2- was 0.0281 M, which is much higher than the options. So perhaps the question is actually about the PO4^3- concentration, which is what I calculated.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is 6.17e-7 M, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we analyze the dissociation behavior of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, in water. The solution contains both H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). These species are in equilibrium, and the solution acts as a buffer between the second and third dissociation steps of H₃PO₄.

### Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005623 \, \text{mol} \)
- Volume of solution = \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L} \)

Initial concentrations:
\[
[H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005623}{0.2} \approx 0.028115 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate pH
The solution is a buffer between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, corresponding to the second dissociation step of H₃PO₄ (\( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} \right)
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log \left( \frac{0.028115}{0.036685} \right) \approx 7.207 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 \approx 7.093
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻ (orthophosphate ion)
The third dissociation step of H₃PO₄ is:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
Using the equilibrium expression:
\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H^+]}
\]
From the pH, \([H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

Substitute the values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028115)}{8.2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.06 \times 10^{-14}}{8.2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ (\(\text{orthophosphate ion}\)) is approximately \(6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option **A** (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

Answer: A
