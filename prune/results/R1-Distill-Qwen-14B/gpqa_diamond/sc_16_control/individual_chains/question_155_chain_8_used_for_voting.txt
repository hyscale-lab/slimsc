Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me the matrices for the operators Px, Py, and Pz. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which probably means that the matrix representation is already diagonal for Pz. Wait, looking at Pz's matrix: the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second is [0, 0, 0], third is [0,0,-ħ]. So yes, Pz is diagonal, which makes sense because the basis vectors are its eigenvectors.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that out:

The state vector ψ = [ -1/2, √2/2, -1/2 ]^T? Wait, wait. Wait, the elements are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh, okay, so the components are as given, no squaring needed. So ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but for normalization, I should check if this is a valid state. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating each component squared:

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2,

(-1/2)^2 =1/4.

Sum: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 )= 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, the question is about finding the uncertainty in Pz, denoted ΔPz. From quantum mechanics, I remember that the uncertainty is given by the square root of the expectation of (Pz squared) minus the square of the expectation of Pz.

So, ΔPz = sqrt( <Pz²> - <Pz>² )

But since Pz is diagonal in the given basis, which are its eigenvectors, maybe I can compute this without too much trouble.

Wait, but the state ψ is given in the eigenbasis of Pz. So that means each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenvalue of Pz. Let me see: The diagonal elements of Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+z>, |0>, |–z> perhaps?

Wait, the columns of the matrix are the basis vectors. So the first basis vector is [1,0,0], the second [0,1,0], and the third [0,0,1]. So the state ψ is expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

So ψ = (-1/2)|+z> + (1/√2)|0> + (-1/2)|–z>

Wait, but wait: Pz has eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis vectors. So when the state is written as a combination, each component's coefficient is the amplitude for being in that eigenstate.

So when I compute <Pz>, it's the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Similarly, since Pz is diagonal, <Pz> is just the weighted sum of eigenvalues where the weights are |c_i|^2.

So let's compute <Pz> first.

The state ψ has components c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

The eigenvalues for Pz are:

For |+z> (first basis vector): λ1 = ħ,

For |0> (second): λ2 = 0,

For |–z> (third): λ3 = -ħ.

So <Pz> = |c1|² λ1 + |c2|² λ2 + |c3|² λ3

Compute each term:

|c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,

|c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2,

|c3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So,

= (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)

= (1/4 ħ ) - (1/4 ħ )

= 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. The expectation of Pz is zero.

Now, compute <Pz²>.

Since Pz is diagonal, Pz^2 is just the square of each diagonal element.

So the eigenvalues for Pz² are (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So <Pz²> = |c1|^2 * (ħ²) + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (ħ²)

= (1/4) * ħ² + 0 + (1/4) * ħ²

= (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ²

= (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔPz = sqrt( <Pz²> - (<Pz>)^2 )

Since <Pz> is zero, <Pz>² = 0.

So ΔPz = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2). So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Because sometimes when you have off-diagonal terms, but in this case, since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz, Pz is diagonal, so the expectation values are straightforward.

Wait, another approach: maybe calculate <Pz> directly using matrix multiplication.

The state is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Pz matrix is diagonal with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ].

So <Pz> = ψ^† Pz ψ.

Which is the sum over i of ψ_i^* * (Pz)_ii * ψ_i.

Which is:

(-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because ψ is a column vector, so ψ^† is a row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Then ψ^† Pz is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ].

Then multiplying by ψ gives:

[ (-1/2)*ħ * (-1/2) ] + [ (0) * (1/√2) ] + [ (ħ/2) * (-1/2) ]

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each term individually.

Wait, Pz is diagonal, so when you multiply Pz and ψ, each component is just the eigenvalue multiplied by the corresponding ψ component.

So ψ^† Pz ψ = sum_i (ψ_i^* Pz_ii ψ_i )

So for each component i:

i=1: ψ_1^* * Pz_11 * ψ_1 = (-1/2)^* * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/2) * ħ * (1/2) )? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, ψ_1 is -1/2. So ψ_1^* is also -1/2, because it's real.

Wait, no, wait: ψ is a real vector here. Because all the components are real numbers. So ψ_1^* = ψ_1 = -1/2.

So each term:

i=1: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

i=2: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

i=3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = [ (1/2) ħ ] * (-1/2) )= - (1/4) ħ.

Wait, wait, that's -1/4 ħ.

So sum is (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Which matches what I found earlier. So <Pz> is zero.

Then <Pz²> is sum of |ψ_i|^2 * (Pz_ii)^2.

Which is:

i=1: | -1/2 |^2 * ħ^2 = (1/4) ħ².

i=2: |1/√2|^2 * 0^2 = 0.

i=3: | -1/2 |^2 * (ħ^2) = (1/4) ħ².

Total: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <Pz²> is (1/2) ħ², so ΔPz = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2), which is option B.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$). The components of $\psi$ are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these into the formula:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$, $\lambda_2^2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
