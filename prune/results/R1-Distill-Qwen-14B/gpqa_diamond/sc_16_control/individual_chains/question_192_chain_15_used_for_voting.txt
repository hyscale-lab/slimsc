Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with a different formula for E.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, that should induce some charges on the conductor's surfaces.

Wait, wait. Oh right! When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor as a whole was initially neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge equal to +q. Because the conductor itself must remain neutral overall. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q.

So the point P is outside the conductor, right? So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. Because the inner charge (-q) is enclosed within the conductor, their fields inside the conductor (which is a conductor, so fields should be zero) but the outer charge's field would contribute at a point outside.

Wait, but wait, no. The conductor is initially uncharged. So when +q is placed in the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q (as induced), and then the outer surface must have +q to balance that, keeping the conductor neutral. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer.

But for a point outside the conductor, the electric field would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge distribution is spherically symmetric, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the outer surface would have a charge of +q, but the conductor is a sphere, so the charge distribution on the outer surface would be uniform. So from outside, the field would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center.

Wait, but in this setup, the cavity is off-center. The center of the cavity is shifted by s from the center of the conductor. So does that affect the field outside?

Wait, no. Because for a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will rearrange such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves in a way that the net field inside is zero, including any effects from the inner charge.

Wait, but the inner charge's field would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but the outer surface would have a charge of +q, but its distribution depends on the shape. Oh, but the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge should distribute uniformly. Because any non-spherical charge distribution on a spherical conductor would create a non-uniform field inside, but the field inside must be zero. So the outer surface's charge must be uniformly distributed regardless of the inner cavity's position.

Wait, but wait, the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge is -q, but it's not uniformly distributed because the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge is induced to -q but arranged in a non-uniform way. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would still have a uniform charge distribution, because any asymmetry in the cavity doesn't affect the outer surface's symmetry.

Ah, because the outer surface is a sphere. So the charge on the outer surface must be uniformly distributed, regardless of what's going on inside. So, the field outside would be the same as if all the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. So, the electric field at P would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor, right? Because from outside, the conductor behaves as if all its charge were at the center.

So the electric field E at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? Because the charge is inside the cavity, which is not at the center. So the inner charge is at a certain position, but the outer surface's charge is uniform.

Wait, but the field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, regardless of how that charge was arranged. So yes, the field outside would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So the position of the cavity (the shift s) doesn't affect the external field.

So why are the other options given? Let me look at the other options.

Option A: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (l - s cosθ)^2. Hmm, that seems like it's considering the displacement from the point P to the center of the cavity, adjusted by the displacement s and the angle. Wait, but that would imply that the field is due to the charge at the cavity's center, but that's inside the conductor. But the conductor's outer surface has the charge +q, which is uniformly distributed.

Wait, but perhaps the point P is outside, so the field is due to the +q on the outer surface. So the field would be as if +q were at the center of the conductor, which is at a distance L from P. So the field would be (q/(4πε₀ L²)).

So option B is that.

Option D: (q/(4πε₀ l²)). That would be the field if the charge were at the center of the cavity (distance l from P). But the charge is inside the conductor, which is a conductor. So the field outside is due to the outer surface's charge, not the inner.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, and the charge $+q$ on it distributes uniformly. This uniform distribution ensures that the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the charge on the outer surface is uniformly distributed, the field at $P$ is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This formula suggests the field depends on the distance $(l - s \cos\theta)$, which is inconsistent with the fact that the field outside the conductor depends only on the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface.
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor, as it depends only on the charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.
   - **Option C**: This formula incorrectly modifies the distance $l$ by adding $s \cos\theta$, which is irrelevant for the external field.
   - **Option D**: This formula assumes the field is due to the charge at the center of the cavity, but the field outside the conductor is determined by the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface, not the inner charge.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
