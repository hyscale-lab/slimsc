Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D, all in the order of 1e-15 meters or so.

Wait, I remember that particles decay when they have a certain lifetime. The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So, mean distance = c * τ, but wait, is it c or v? Oh right, velocity times lifetime.

But how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (Γ) and time uncertainty (τ) is on the order of ħ/2. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, I think the exact relation is Γ = ħ / τ. No, wait, let me think. The natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm probably mixing up the units here. Let me get the units straight. Planck's constant ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because ħ is usually in J·s, but converting to GeV·s.

So Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let's compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = around 20.568, so 20.568e-25, wait no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ is about 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32: 6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25? Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no: Wait, GeV is 1e9 eV, but no, in terms of units, it's just the energy unit. So the calculation is correct. So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with some energy, I can find its velocity. The meson's energy E is 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy formula: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, but I have to be careful with units here. Let's think in natural units where c=1. So E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²) / c. Wait, but in natural units, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but when c=1, E is GeV, m is GeV/c², but since in natural units c=1, m is just GeV.

Wait, let me clarify: E in GeV, m in GeV/c². Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute p in units where c=1. So, p = sqrt(E² - m²) / c, but if c is in m/s, then perhaps I should calculate it.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it in terms of beta (β) and gamma (γ). Because beta is v/c, and gamma is E/(m c²). So, gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². Let me think about this.

Wait, let's compute gamma: E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.666... So, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let's compute beta.

Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400)/(9). So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma² is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So approximately 0.9887c.

So v is about 0.9887c.

Now, the mean decay distance is v * τ. Hmm, so let's compute that.

v is approximately 0.9887c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

And τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So let's compute v * τ.

v * τ = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute the numbers:

0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

What's 2.966 * 2.056875?

Let me compute that. Let's approximate:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.16875.

So total approx 6.10075.

So 6.10075e-16 meters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

2.056875 is approximately 2.05688.

2.966 * 2.05688 = ?

Well, 2 * 2.966 = 5.932.

0.05688 * 2.966 = let's compute 0.05 *2.966=0.1483, 0.00688 *2.966≈0.02036. So total is 0.1483 + 0.02036 ≈0.16866.

So 5.932 + 0.16866 = 6.10066.

So approximately 6.10066e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A: ~5.0223e-16 m

B: ~4.0655e-15 m

C: ~5.0223e-15 m

D: ~4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation is around 6.1e-16 meters. But none of the options are near 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the lifetime. Let me recheck the lifetime calculation.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Tau is hbar / Gamma.

Wait, hbar is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 [GeV·s] / 0.32 [GeV] = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Wait, 6.582 /0.32. Let's compute that.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582-6.4=0.182. 0.182 /0.32 = ~0.56875. So total is 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Wait, when I calculated v, I used the gamma as 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV. That's correct, because E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...

Then beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma squared.

Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9). 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta squared = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

So v is approximately 0.9887c, which is about 2.966e8 m/s.

So v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

As before, 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈6.10075, so 6.10075e-16 meters.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta? Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So, yes, gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666..., correct.

Beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (9/400) = 391/400 = 0.9775. Correct.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately let me compute.

0.9887 squared is approx (0.9887)^2 = (approx 0.9775). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity. Because, in relativity, the velocity is v = beta c, but when you compute the mean decay length, you might have to consider the lifetime in the lab frame. Hmm, but in this case, since the particle is moving, the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer by gamma. Oh wait, wait! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Because the lifetime I calculated is in the particle's rest frame. So to get the mean lifetime in the lab frame, I have to multiply by gamma. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (the tau I calculated).

Wait, right! Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the rest frame. The lab sees it as tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Ah, so I completely forgot to multiply the lifetime by gamma. That's a big mistake!

So, the proper lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma = 2.056875e-24 s.

The lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667. So:

tau_lab = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

20/3 is about 6.6666667.

2.056875e-24 * 6.6666667 = let's compute.

2.056875e-24 * 6 = 12.34125e-24.

2.056875e-24 * 0.6666667 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

So total: 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait, maybe better to compute 2.056875 * 6.6666667.

2.056875 * 6 =12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.6666667 ≈1.37125.

Total is 13.7125.

So tau_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait: 2.056875e-24 multiplied by 6.6666667 is:

2.056875 *6.6666667 = let me compute it.

6 * 2.056875 =12.34125.

0.6666667 *2.056875 ≈(2/3)*2.056875= approx 1.37125.

So 12.34125 +1.37125=13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 seconds.

So now the mean decay distance is v * tau_lab.

v is 0.9887c, which is 0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So v * tau_lab = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply the numbers:

2.966 *1.37125 ≈ let me compute.

2 *1.37125=2.7425.

0.966 *1.37125 ≈ approx 1.318.

So total approx 4.0605.

So 4.0605e-15 meters.

Wait, because 1e8 *1e-23 =1e-15, so 4.06e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, so 4.06e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation for 2.966 *1.37125.

Wait 2.966 *1.37125.

Let me compute it step by step.

1.37125 * 2 = 2.7425.

1.37125 *0.966 = ?

Well, 1.37125 *0.9 =1.234125.

1.37125 *0.06 =0.082275.

1.37125 *0.006=0.0082275.

Adding them up: 1.234125 +0.082275 =1.3164 +0.0082275=1.3246275.

So total 2.7425 +1.3246275 =4.0671275.

So 2.966 *1.37125 = approx 4.0671.

So 4.0671e-15 meters.

Which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the relation:

\[
\text{Mean decay distance} = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \(v\) is the velocity of the meson and \(\tau_{\text{lab}}\) is the lifetime of the meson in the lab frame. The steps to calculate these quantities are as follows:

---

### 1. **Calculate the lifetime in the rest frame (\(\tau\)):**

The width \(\Gamma\) is related to the proper lifetime \(\tau\) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\Gamma \cdot \tau = \hbar
\]

Given \(\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}\) and \(\Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV}\), we solve for \(\tau\):

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

---

### 2. **Relate the proper lifetime to the lab frame lifetime (\(\tau_{\text{lab}}\)):**

The lab frame lifetime is longer due to time dilation and is given by:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau,
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}\). The energy \(E = 8 \, \text{GeV}\) and the mass \(m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}\), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

Substituting \(\tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}\):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

---

### 3. **Calculate the velocity of the meson (\(v\)):**

The velocity is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad v = \beta c.
\]

First, compute \(\beta\):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2} = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775,
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

---

### 4. **Calculate the mean decay distance:**

The mean decay distance is:

\[
\text{Mean decay distance} = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]

Substitute \(v = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(\tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}\):

\[
\text{Mean decay distance} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

---

### 5. **Compare with the options:**

The calculated mean decay distance (\(4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}\)) matches most closely with option **B** (\(4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}\)).

---

**Answer: B**
