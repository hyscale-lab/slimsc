Okay, so I need to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's photon momentum when it absorbs a photon to switch states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to go to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in rotation-vibration models, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational parts. So when it absorbs a photon, it can change either rotationally, vibrationally, or both. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So probably, it's the smallest possible energy transition, which would be either a vibrational or rotational change, whichever is smaller.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either increasing v by 1 (v=1) or increasing J by 1 (J=1). But which transition requires less energy?

I think the vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing much larger than the rotational ones. Because for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, so the spacing between v=0 and v=1 is h w. The rotational levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), with B being a rotational constant. The spacing between J and J+1 is about 2B(J+1), which for small J is approximately 2B.

So comparing the energy differences: the vibrational transition would require h w, and the rotational would require about 2B. So which is larger? Let's compute both and see.

Given the data: m_X = 20 amu, m_Y = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (m_X * m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the vibrational energy spacing is h w. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = approx 2.65e-19 J.

For rotational energy, the spacing between J and J+1 is about 2 B (J+1), but for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot = B*(1*(1+1)) - B*0 = 2B. But B is (h²)/(8 μ R²). Let me calculate B.

So B = (h²)/(8 μ R²). Let's plug in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg
R = 2e-10 m

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

8 μ R² = 8 * 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 8 * 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 8 * 1.204e-46 = 9.632e-46.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.632e-46 ≈ 4.55e-22 J.

So the energy for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.1e-22 J.

Comparing the two: h w is about 2.65e-19 J, and 2B is 9.1e-22 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the molecule would absorb a photon corresponding to the rotational transition, not the vibrational.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next state in the hierarchy. But I'm a bit confused because the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. So the next state could be either a higher vibration (v=1) or a higher rotation (J=1). Which has lower energy?

The energy of the total state is E = E_vib + E_rot. For the fundamental state, E = (0 + 1/2) h w + B (0 + 1) * 0 = 0.5 h w.

If the molecule transitions to J=1, v=0: E = 0.5 h w + 2B.

If it transitions to v=1, J=0: E = (1 + 1/2) h w + B * 0 = 1.5 h w.

Which of these two is lower? 0.5 h w + 2B vs 1.5 h w.

As h w is about 2.65e-19 J and 2B is 9.1e-22 J, 0.5 h w is 1.325e-19 J, plus 9.1e-22 J is about 1.334e-19 J. The other option is 1.5 h w = 3.975e-19 J. So 1.334e-19 J is less than 3.975e-19 J. Therefore, the lower energy transition is the rotational one. So the photon must provide energy for the rotational transition.

Ah, so the energy of the photon must be equal to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is related to energy E via E=pc, since for photons, E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

So the photon's momentum is E_rot / c. Or wait, the energy change is 2B? Because from J=0 to J=1, E_rot increases by 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B.

So E_photon = 2B.

So p_photon = E_photon / c = (2B) / c.

Wait, wait, no. I thought for photons, E = h f = pc. So p = E/(c). So yes.

So first, calculate E_rot difference: 2B. Then find p = (2B)/c.

We have B from earlier as approximately 4.55e-22 J. So 2B is 9.1e-22 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.1e-22 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.1e-22) / (3e8) N·s/m * m/s? Wait, let me calculate it.

Wait, J = kg·m²/s². Momentum p has unit kg·m/s. So J/(m/s) = kg·m²/s² / (m/s) )= kg·m/s, which is correct.

So 9.1e-22 / 3e8 = (9.1 /3) * 1e-30 = approx 3.03e-30 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait wait, no:

Wait, 9.1e-22 / 3e8 = 3.033e-30 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are on the order of 1e-27 Ns. Because 1 Ns is kg·m/s.

Wait, 3e-30 kg·m/s is 3e-30 Ns. But the options are like 1e-27, which is 1e3 times larger. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait let me double-check B.

Calculating B again.

B = h²/(8 μ R²)

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

μ = (20 *2) / (22) amu = (40/22) amu = (20/11) ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m.

So R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Now compute 8 μ R²: 8 * 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 8 * (3.01e-27 * 4e-20) = 8 * 1.204e-46 = 9.632e-46 kg·m².

So B = (4.39e-67 J²·s²) / (9.632e-46 kg·m²) ) = 4.39e-67 / 9.632e-46 = 4.55e-22 J.

So 2B is 9.1e-22 J.

Now, E_photon = 9.1e-22 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.1e-22 / (3e8) = (9.1 /3) * 1e-30 ≈ 3.03e-30 kg·m/s = 3.03e-30 N·s.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are on the order of 1e-27 Ns, which is 1e3 times higher. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting amu to kg. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So for μ, (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converted to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg. So that part is correct.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, could the transition be a vibrational one instead?

Wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. So the photon's energy would be 9.1e-22 J, but that gives p_photon = 3e-30 Ns, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model sometimes refers to the vibration being considered, but perhaps the question is considering that the transition is a vibrational one. Because for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be J=1 (rotational), or v=1 (vibrational). The question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition gives the lowest energy increment?

I previously thought that the rotational transition (J=1, v=0) has a lower energy than the vibrational (v=1, J=0). So the photon should provide the rotational energy.

Wait, but maybe I miscalculated the energy of the rotational transition. Let me recompute. The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is:

E = B(1)(2) - B(0)(1) = 2B.

So energy needed is 2B.

The vibrational transition is from v=0 to v=1, which is:

E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference is ( (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) ) h w = (1) h w = h w.

h w is 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Earlier, I found that 2B is 9.1e-22 J, which is much smaller than h w. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon must have energy matching the rotational transition.

But earlier calculation gave p_photon = 3e-30 Ns, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the energy levels. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), so the transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. So, the photon's energy is 2B.

But perhaps the question is considering a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes. But that would be higher energy, so not the next lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first excited state as the combination of the next available state, which could be a mix. But I think no, the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy for rotation and for vibration, and see which is smaller. So 2B is 9.1e-22 J, h w is 2.65e-19 J. So 2B is much smaller, so the photon's energy is 2B.

But the options don't have 3e-30 Ns. Hmm. Let's see the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, none of these are near 3e-30.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units when calculating p.

Wait, E_photon = 2B =9.1e-22 J.

p = E / c = 9.1e-22 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.03e-30 kg m/s = 3.03e-30 N s.

But 3e-30 is 0.3e-29, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere else. Because sometimes for the rotational energy, I might have to consider the spacing between J and J+1 as 2B(2J+1). Or perhaps the selection rules. Wait, but the question is about the transition, so the energy needed is 2B.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the photon causing a transition to the next energy level, but the transition could be a combination of both vibrations and rotations. But that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the problem and the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state, and the next state is the first excited rotational state, which is J=1.

Wait, but that brings me back to the previous calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational photon's momentum, just in case.

If the photon is absorbed for a vibrational transition, then E_photon = h w = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

8.83e-28 isn't in the options. So that's not matching either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, B = h²/(8 μ R²)

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

μ is 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m, R squared is 4e-20 m².

8 μ R² = 8 * 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 8 * 1.204e-46 = 9.632e-46 kg m².

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.632e-46 = (4.39 /9.632) * 1e-21 = approx 0.455 * 1e-21 = 4.55e-22 J.

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the Raman transition, which involves changes in both J and vibration. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state, which may be a higher rotational state. Alternatively, it could be a combination of both, but that would require more energy.

Wait, perhaps the next state isn't the next rotational state, but the next vibrational state. But that would require higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first excited state as the first state above the ground state, which could be either rotation or vibration. The ground state is v=0, J=0. The first excited state could be either J=1 or v=1, whichever has lower energy. Since 2B is 9.1e-22 J and h w is 2.65e-19 J, the rotational transition is lower. So the photon energy is 2B.

But then, the p_photon is 3e-30 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, the reduced mass μ is (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y).

m_X =20 amu, m_Y=2 amu. So (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the rotational partition function? No, that's not relevant here.

Wait, is there another approach? Maybe using the moment of inertia. The rotational constant B is h/(8 π² c μ R²), but I think that's the same as h squared over 8 μ R squared.

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check the rotational energy formula. The rotational energy levels are given by:

E_rot = (ħ² / (2 μ R²)) J (J+1), where ħ is h/(2π).

Wait, no, the energy expression is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 μ R²).

But wait, I used B = h²/(8 μ R²), because h = 2π ħ. So h squared is 4 π² ħ squared.

So, let me re-express B correctly.

B = (ħ²)/(2 μ R²)

But ħ = h/(2 π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²).

So B = (h²/(4 π²)) / (2 μ R²) )= h²/(8 π² μ R²).

Ah, wait, I think I forgot the π² in the denominator. That's a mistake.

Earlier, I calculated B as h²/(8 μ R²). But it should be h²/(8 π² μ R²).

Ugh, that's a critical mistake. So let's fix that.

So B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

So let's recompute B.

h =6.626e-34.

h squared is 4.39e-67 J² s².

μ =3.01e-27 kg.

R squared is 4e-20 m².

8 pi squared μ R squared is 8 * (9.8696) * 3.01e-27 *4e-20.

Calculate step by step.

8 * pi^2 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Multiply by μ R²: 78.9568 * 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 78.9568 *1.204e-46 kg m².

78.9568 *1.204 ≈ 95.12.

So 95.12e-46 kg m² =9.512e-45 kg m².

So B = h² / (8 pi² μ R²) = 4.39e-67 / 9.512e-45 = approx 4.615e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.23e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.23e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.077e-31 kg m/s = 3.077e-31 N s.

Wait, that's even smaller than before. Now it's 3.08e-31 Ns, which is even further from the options.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. I must have messed up another part.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me check again.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant given by B = h/(8 pi² c mu R²). Or is it another formula?

Wait, I think I might have confused the formula. Let me recall. The rotational energy levels can also be written as E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 μ R²).

Since ħ = h/(2 pi), so ħ² = h²/(4 pi²).

So E_rot = [ h²/(4 pi²) * J (J+1) ] / (2 mu R² ) = h² J (J+1) / (8 pi² mu R²).

Thus, the rotational constant B is h²/(8 pi² mu R²) * 1/(J (J+1)).

Wait, no, B is a constant for the molecule, so E_rot = B J (J+1), so B is h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

Yes, so B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²), which is what I used. So that part was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot to convert R from angstroms to meters? Let me double-check.

No, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the energy difference when the molecule transitions. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in v=0 and J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next available state with the smallest delta E. That would be the first state in the hierarchy, which is either a higher J or a higher v.

So, from v=0, J=0 to either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0.

Which requires less energy?

Compute delta E for both transitions.

For J=0 to J=1:
delta E = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B(1)(2) - 0 = 2B.

For v=0 to v=1:
delta E = E(v=1) - E(v=0) = ( (1 + 1/2) h w ) - ( (0 + 1/2) h w ) ) = h w.

Which is larger, 2B or h w?

We have values:

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

2B: with B = 4.615e-23 J, 2B=9.23e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.23e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J.

So 2B is smaller than h w. Therefore, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 2B = 9.23e-23 J.

So p_photon = 9.23e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.076e-31 Ns.

But this is still way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but in reality, the non-rigid rotor model includes the vibration. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond length changes during vibration, but perhaps the calculation for B is different. Maybe B should be calculated using the vibration model.

Wait, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I = mu R^2. But in a non-rigid rotor, R is not fixed. But for the purpose of calculating B, we use the equilibrium bond length R, so I think the calculation remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy. But that would be higher than either, which doesn't make sense for the next lowest state.

Hmm. Another thought: the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. The problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we are to find the photon that would take it to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the next state includes both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require more energy than each individual change, so it's not the lowest.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's energy is quantized in such a way that the next state is a combination of J and v. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0), whose energy is higher than the rotational transition (v=0, J=1). But since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the one the photon would be absorbed for.

But then, why isn't the p_photon matching any of the options? The options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum, and I'm miscalculating it. Let me recompute p_photon.

E_photon = 2B =9.23e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.23e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Calculating 9.23e-23 /3e8 = 3.076e-31 kg·m/s = 3.076e-31 N·s.

But the options are all about 1e-27 Ns. So 3e-31 is 3e-4 times smaller than the smallest option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me redo B.

B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² mu R^2 =8 * (9.8696) * (3.01e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²).

Compute:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.8 *3.01e-27 =78.8 *3.01 =237.288e-27 =2.37288e-25.

2.37288e-25 kg *4e-20 m² =9.4915e-45 kg·m².

So B =4.39e-67 / 9.4915e-45 = approximately 4.62e-23 J.

So E_photon = 2B =9.24e-23 J.

p_photon =9.24e-23 /3e8 =3.08e-31 Ns.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me compute it again.

m_X =20 amu, m_Y=2 amu.

mu = (20 *2 )/(20+2 )=40/22=1.818 amu.

1 amu=1.660539e-27 kg.

mu=1.818 *1.660539e-27 kg.

1.818 *1.660539 = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering a different transition. For example, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Let me compute p for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.833e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps the question is not about the next state, but the next allowed state in the rigid rotor model. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the first excited state. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state. What momentum should an absorbed photon have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps it's the first excited state, which is the next state in the energy hierarchy. So the molecule's energy goes from E= E0 (v=0, J=0) to E=E1, which is the next energy level regardless of J and v.

In that case, the next state could be a higher J or a higher v, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but E0 is the ground state, and E1 could be either the first rotational state or the first vibrational state. Since the rotational state requires less energy, E1 would be the rotational state.

So the photon's energy is 2B, and p_photon is 3.08e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require h w. Or perhaps the first excited rotational state, which requires 2B.

But none of the options fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the energy is 2B or B. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So when J increases by 1, from J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by 2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

But perhaps the question is considering the next state as J=1, which is the same as 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, which would have B = h²/(8 mu R²), without the pi². So in that case, B would be h²/(8 mu R²) =4.39e-67 / (8 *3.01e-27 *4e-20) = 4.39e-67 / (9.63e-46) =4.55e-22 J.

Then, 2B is 9.1e-22 J.

p_photon=9.1e-22 /3e8=3.03e-30 Ns.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as h bar (reduced) over lambda, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should compute the photon's wavelength and then find the momentum. But wait, I don't see how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the rotational-vibrational coupling but only about the rotational transition.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So perhaps the energy levels are a sum of both.

Wait, but the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Earlier calculations show that the rotational transition requires less energy. So photon's energy is 2B.

But the options don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). B is related to the moments of inertia and the angular frequency of rotation, which is different from the vibrational frequency w. So perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the frequency corresponding to the rotational transition.

The energy for the rotational transition is 2B = ħ w_rot, so w_rot = 2B / ħ.

But ħ is h/(2 pi). So w_rot = 2B * 2 pi / h = (4 pi B)/h.

But substituting B =h²/(8 pi² mu R²), we get:

w_rot = 4 pi * (h^2/(8 pi² mu R²)) / h = (4 pi h^2)/(8 pi² mu R² h ) = (h)/(2 pi mu R²).

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let's think about the energy of the photon.

The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. So, if the transition is rotational, delta E = 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B.

Thus, p_photon = 2B / c.

But with B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²), substituting:

p_photon = 2 * h²/(8 pi² mu R²) / c.

= h²/(4 pi² mu R² c).

But perhaps I can write it in terms of the given variables.

Wait, let me write it as p = (h²) / (4 pi² mu R² c).

Plugging in the numbers:

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

mu =3.01e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

pi squared is about 9.8696.

mu R² =3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 m² =3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 4 *9.8696 *1.204e-46 *3e8.

Compute denominator step by step:

4 *9.8696 ≈39.478.

39.478 *1.204e-46 ≈47.5e-46 =4.75e-45.

4.75e-45 *3e8 =1.425e-36.

So numerator is 4.39e-67.

Thus, p =4.39e-67 /1.425e-36 =3.08e-31 kg m/s =3.08e-31 Ns.

Still no match with the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state. Even though that requires more energy, maybe the options are pointing that way.

So, for the vibrational transition, E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options are A:1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 isn't an option, but option A is 1.9e-28 and D is 1.4e-28. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula p = E/c, but E is h f, and f = w/(2 pi).

So E = h w / (2 pi) ?

No, because photon energy is E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

Wait, no. The angular frequency w is related to frequency f by w=2 pi f. So E_photon = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

So E_photon = h w / (2 pi).

Wait, so earlier for the rotational transition, I used E_photon =2B. But if I compute E_photon using this, let me see.

Wait, no, that's for the frequency. The rotational energy is in terms of B, which is in joules. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute p = E_photon/c, where E_photon is the energy difference, which is 2B.

But as we've computed, that leads to p_photon around 3e-31 Ns, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, which requires E= h w. So p_photon = h w/(c).

But let me compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28), but not exactly matching. But 8.8e-28 is twice as big as option A, and about six times larger than D.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4 )e-34+14=26.504e-20= 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the Raman transition, which involves a change in vibrational state and rotational state. But that's more advanced and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state but with a change in rotational state as well, but that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to J=2 or another state. But that would require even more energy.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate whether the next state is actually the next vibrational state.

Because if the energy for the rotational transition (2B=9.23e-23 J) is much smaller than the vibrational (2.65e-19 J), but the options don't have such a small value, perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

So, in that case, p_photon =8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that. The closest options are A and D.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck the calculation.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 = (2.65 /3 ) *1e-27 ≈0.883e-27 =8.83e-28 Ns.

So 8.83e-28 Ns. None of the options match exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about double. Perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 4e14 rad/s is the angular frequency. So the frequency f is w/(2pi) = (4e14)/(2pi) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

Then E_photon = h f =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 =4.22e-20 J.

p_photon =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 Ns.

Ah! That's approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

Wait, what's going on here. Earlier, I thought E_photon was h w, but w is the angular frequency, so f= w/(2 pi). So perhaps I should use E= h f instead of h w.

So E_photon = h * (w/(2 pi)).

That's correct because E=h f and f= w/(2 pi).

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s / (2 pi)).

Compute 4e14/(2 pi) = (4/(6.283))e14 ≈0.6366e14 ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E =6.626e-34 *6.366e13= approx 4.22e-20 J.

p_photon =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 Ns.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

Ah! That must be the correct approach. So the mistake was using w instead of f in the photon energy calculation.

So the correct answer is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon that allows the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the next possible states. The molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for both vibrational and rotational energy levels.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). The energy difference for a transition from \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \) is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \).
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \). For a transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \), the energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \).

2. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition energy is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
   - The rotational transition energy is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \). Substituting \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \), where \( \mu = 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), \( R = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), and \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we find \( B \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.1 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

   Comparing the two, \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), so the rotational transition requires less energy.

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The energy of the photon must match the energy difference of the transition. For the rotational transition, \( E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \).
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( E_{\text{photon}} = 2B \), we calculate:
     \[
     p = \frac{2B}{c} = \frac{9.1 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.03 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - This result is far smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting the question instead refers to the vibrational transition.

4. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - For the vibrational transition, \( E_{\text{photon}} = h \omega = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
   - The corresponding momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - This value is also not an exact match to the options. However, recalculating using \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \) and \( f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \), we find:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = h f = h \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]
     \[
     p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - This matches closely with option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the vibrational transition, and the momentum of the photon is approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).
