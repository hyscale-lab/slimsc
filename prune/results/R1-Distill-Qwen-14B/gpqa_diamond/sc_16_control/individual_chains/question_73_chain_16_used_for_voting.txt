Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic speeds and energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The questions are about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do v = v1 - v2. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So, let's plug in the numbers.

So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. Wait, but wait: relative to which frame? Oh, I think the question is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So, if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, then in astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 would be moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, no. Wait, the velocity addition formula is used when you have two frames moving relative to each other, and you want to find the velocity of an object in one frame as seen from the other. So, if astronaut 2 is moving at velocity u' = 0.5c in the same direction as astronaut 1's velocity u = 0.6c (from the lab frame, say), then the relative velocity v would be (u - u')/(1 - (u u')/c²). Because the frame is moving at u, and we want to find the velocity of the object in that frame.

So substituting u = 0.6c, u' = 0.5c. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I got that backwards. Because in the lab frame, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So if we are in astronaut 1's frame, the speed of astronaut 2 would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6 * 0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's about 0.14c, so looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

So that's the relative speed part. Now for the total energy.

Total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 2m * c² * gamma = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait wait, no. Wait, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So for astronaut 1: mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. So E1 = gamma * (2m) c². Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)) = same as before, 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Similarly, astronaut 2 has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² ≈ 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower, so that's not it. Option D has E=5 mc², which is a bit lower.

So the options are C and D. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I account for the correct rest masses? Let me recheck the calculations.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/(sqrt(0.64)) = 1.25.

E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.154700538.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641, so 5.96 mc², which is option C.

And for the relative speed, 0.14c, so the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( v_1 = 0.6c \) and \( v_2 = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
