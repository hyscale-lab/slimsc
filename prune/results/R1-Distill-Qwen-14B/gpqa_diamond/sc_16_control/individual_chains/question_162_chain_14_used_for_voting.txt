Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to work through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²). So the denominator simplifies to 4 minus the radius squared in some sense because r squared is x² + y². Oh, right! So 4 - r², where r is sqrt(x² + y²). 

I remember that the area element in a metric is found by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor here is diagonal because dx² and dy² are separate. So the components g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). The off-diagonal terms are zero, so the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))². Taking the square root gives 32/(4 - r²). 

Therefore, the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] dr² dθ, where θ is the angle around the circle. Wait, no, actually, in 2D polar coordinates, area element is r dr dθ. Hmm, but in this case, the metric is written in terms of x and y, not directly in polar. So, I need to express it in polar coordinates or find the area another way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the 2D metric. The area of a surface with metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²) is the integral over the region of E dx dy. So, to find the total area, I'd integrate E over the area where the metric is defined.

So E is 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²). The region where the metric is defined is where 4 - r² > 0, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or imaginary. So the domain is r² < 4, so r < 2. So the radius r goes from 0 to 2, and θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π of E * r dr dθ, but wait, no. Wait, in the metric, it's E(dx² + dy²), so in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = r² dr² + r² dθ². So, when I express the area in polar coordinates, it's the integral of sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ, but earlier I found sqrt(det(g)) as 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. Wait, no, because in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xg_y - (g_xy)^2) dx dy, which in this case is 32/(4 - r²) dx dy. But when we switch to polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, so the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. 

Wait, so putting it all together, the area is the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. 

Hmm, so let's compute the integral. The integral over θ is straightforward: 2π. So the area becomes 2π * ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute that integral. Let me substitute u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr. So, 32 r dr = -16 du. Wait, here's the integral:

∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = ∫ (32 r dr) / u = -16 ∫ du/u. The limits when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. 

So the integral becomes from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) * (1/u) du. Which is the same as 16 ∫ from u=0 to u=4 (1/u) du. But wait, that's 16 ln(u) evaluated from 0 to 4. But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to 4 of 1/u du diverges. Oh no, that means the integral is infinite.

Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero. So near r=2, the integrand becomes large, leading the area to diverge. So the area is infinite. 

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Or maybe I'm confusing them with other surfaces. Let me think. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given here might represent a pseudosphere. The area should be 4π r^2 times (−1/(K)) where K is the Gaussian curvature. Because for a surface of constant curvature K, the area is 4π |r² K|, but I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K is related to the metric. For a 2D metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by (−1/(2E)) * [ (d/dx (E_y) − d/dy (E_x) ) ] but perhaps there's a simpler way. Alternatively, for a metric of the form ds² = (4/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ² ), where a is a constant, that's the metric of a pseudosphere (like the Beltrami-Klein model) with Gaussian curvature K = -1/(4a²). Wait, no, perhaps the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(4 a² )).

Wait, in the metric given, E = 32/(4 - r²) where r² = x² + y². Let me write it in polar coordinates. So ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So E = 32/(4−r²), F=0, and G= (32 r²)/(4−r²).

The formula for Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E dr² + G dθ² (assuming F=0) is [−(1/(2E)) (∂/∂r ( (G/E) * ( ∂E/∂θ ) ) − ∂/∂θ ( (E/G) * (∂G/∂r) )) ) ] but since E and G are functions of r only, the partial derivatives with respect to theta are zero. So perhaps K = [ -1/(2E) ) * ( (d/d r ( (dG/dr) / E )) ) ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the formula for K when the metric is given in polar coordinates. The formula is K = [−(1/(2 E)) * (∂/∂r (∂E/∂θ) − ∂/∂θ (∂E/∂r)) ) ] / something. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. 

Alternatively, for the metric ds² = (4/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), which is similar to the given metric. Wait, in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which is (2² - r²). So a=2. So from literature, I recall that such a metric has Gaussian curvature K = -1/(4 a²). So K = -1/(4*(2)^2) = -1/16.

But wait, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) with radius r and Gaussian curvature K is given by 4π r² / |K|. Because for a sphere, the area is 4π r², which equals 4π (r²) where K = 1/r². So for a pseudosphere with K = -k² (where k is positive), the area would be 4π (r²) / (k²). Wait, let me check that.

Wait, the general formula for the area of a surface with constant Gaussian curvature K is 4π |r² K|. For a sphere, K is positive. For a pseudosphere (hyperbolic), K is negative. So for a pseudosphere of radius a, which is defined as K = -1/(a²), the area would be 4π a² (since |K| is 1/a², so 4π a² * (1/(1/a²)) )= 4π a² * a²? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again.

Wait, for a unit sphere, K=1, and area is 4π. For a sphere of radius a, K = 1/(a²), area 4π a². For a pseudosphere, K = -1/(a²), so |K|=1/a². So the area would be 4π a² * |K|^-1? No, wait, that would be 4π a^4, which seems too big. Alternatively, perhaps the area is (4π a²) / |K|, since K = 1/(a²) for a sphere, so (4π a²)/(1/a²) )=4 π a^4. That doesn't seem right either.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the integral I was trying earlier. So the area is ∫∫ sqrt(det g) dx dy. Which in polar coordinates is ∫θ=0^{2π} ∫r=0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. 

Wait, the integral becomes 2π ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me compute this integral. Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from u=4 to 0.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) from 4 to 0. The negative sign flips the limits, so:

32 * (1/2) ∫ (du/u) from 0 to 4 → 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is ∫0^4 du/u, which is ln(u) from 0 to4. ln(4) - ln(0). ln(0) is -infinity, so the integral is infinitely large. So the area is infinity.

But wait, that can't be right for a pseudosphere. I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the metric given and the standard pseudosphere. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface of revolution, and it's finite in extent. Its metric is similar but perhaps the area is finite. Wait, but in the metric given, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, leading to the area element blowing up. So the area would be infinite, which would mean the surface is infinitely large. But that's not the case for a pseudosphere. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the given metric is not that of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question because the area is infinite. So the question is, what's the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? But according to the metric, the area is infinite, which would make the answer D, which is +infty.

Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the metric given represents a different kind of surface. Let me see the general form. The metric ds² = (32/(4 - r^2)) (dr² + r² dθ^2). So as r approaches 2, the coefficient becomes very large, so the area near r=2 is highly curved, leading to infinite area. So the surface is infinitely large, hence the area is infinite. But that doesn't fit with the pseudosphere I know, which is finite.

Wait, maybe the given metric isn't of a pseudosphere but of another surface. Because a pseudosphere's metric in polar coordinates would have a different form. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere. Wait, no, the denominator is 4 - r^2, which when r approaches 2, the metric's coefficients diverge, which is more like a hyperbolic space.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a finite surface. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a sphere, but that's not right because the denominator would be 4 - r², which for r=2 would be zero, but a sphere's metric doesn't have that issue.

Wait, perhaps the area is zero. No, that doesn't make sense because the area is the integral of a positive function over a region.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² − y²)

D) +infty

So if the area is infinite, the answer would be D.

But I thought pseudospheres have finite area. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I confused the radius.

Wait, the question says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. But in the metric, the denominator is 4 - r², which is 4 - (x² + y²). So when r is 2, the denominator is zero. Wait, but the pseudosphere is a surface with a certain radius. So perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere of radius 2, and the area is 4π * (2)^2, which is 16π. But that's not an option. The options have 4π (x² + y²), which doesn't make sense as a constant area.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the Gaussian curvature and compute the area from that.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E dr² + G dθ² is given by:

K = [ (∂/∂r (√G)) - (1/(2√E)) ∂/∂θ (√G * ∂E/∂θ) ) ] / something. Wait, perhaps another approach is better. For a metric of the form ds² = (4 / (a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is K = -1/(4 a²). 

So in this case, our metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²) = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me compare with the standard form (4/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So in standard form, 4/(a² - r²), but here it's 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4 - r²) = 8 * (4)/(4 - r²) = 8 * [4/(4 - r²)}. So perhaps the given metric is 8 times the standard hyperbolic metric. 

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the metric can be rewritten as (32)/(4 - r²) = 8 * (4)/(4 - r²) = 8 * [ (4) / (4 - r²) ) ] = 8 * [ (a²) / (a² - r²) ) ] with a² =4, so a=2. So the standard form is (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), so the given metric would be 32/(4 - r^2) = 8 * (4/(4 - r^2)) = 8 * [ (a²)/(a² - r²) ) ] with a=2.

Wait, what is the Gaussian curvature K of the standard metric [ (a²)/(a² - r²) ) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )? I think K is -1/(a²). So our given metric is 8 times [ a^2/(a² - r²) ) ] times (dr² + r² dθ²), where a=2. So the metric would be 8 * [ (4)/(4 - r^2) ) ] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Hmm, so how does this affect the curvature? Let me think. The curvature K is determined by the metric. If the standard metric has curvature K0, and I multiply the metric by a factor λ, then the new curvature K' would be scaled by 1/λ. Because curvature is inversely proportional to the 'size' squared. Alternatively, perhaps the area element is scaled by λ, and the curvature inversely.

Wait, perhaps the Gaussian curvature K is inversely proportional to the square of the radius a. Because for a sphere, K = 1/(a²), so for a pseudosphere, K = -1/(a²). 

So if the standard metric is [a^2/(a^2 - r^2)] (dr² + r^2 dθ^2), then K is -1/(a²). So for a=2, K = -1/4. 

So the area of the pseudosphere is 4π a² / |K|. Because for a sphere, area is 4π a², and K = 1/a², so 4π a² = 4π a² * (1/(1/a²)) ) → 4π a² * a² = 4π a^4, which can't be right. I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is finite, and it's 4π. Because the tractricoid is the surface of revolution of a tractrix, and it's known to have finite area. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the area is 8π.

Wait, going back, the area I computed from the metric is infinite, so if the metric is for a pseudosphere, that would be a problem. But perhaps the given metric isn't the pseudosphere's metric, but another surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere with radius 2 has finite area, but the given metric leads to infinite area. So perhaps the question is a trick question, and the area is infinite, so the correct answer is D.

But then why is the question about a pseudosphere? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric isn't correctly representing a pseudosphere. Let me think: What's the metric of a pseudosphere (tractricoid)? The tractricoid has a metric which, in polar coordinates, can be written as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - r^2/a²), where a is the radius. But wait, that's for r < a. So maybe the metric is (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - r²/a²) = (a²/(a² - r^2)) (dr² + r² dθ^2). 

So comparing to our given metric: [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ^2) = 8 [4/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ^2) = 8 [ (a²)/(a² - r^2) ) ] (dr² + r² dθ^2), with a=2. So the given metric is 8 times the standard tractricoid metric. 

How does scaling the metric by a factor affect the area and curvature? The area would scale by the square of the scaling factor. Wait, scaling the metric by λ would scale the area element by λ, because the area element is sqrt(det g). If g is scaled by λ, then sqrt(det g) is scaled by sqrt(λ), but wait, no: the determinant of a scaled metric is λ^2 times the original determinant. So the area element scales by λ. 

So if the standard tractricoid has area A, then scaling the metric by 8 would make the new area 8*A. But wait, no: the standard tractricoid's metric is (4/(4 - r^2)) (dr² + r² dθ^2). So our given metric is 8 times that. So the area would be 8 times the area of the standard tractricoid. 

But the standard tractricoid (with a=2) has finite area. Let me compute the area of the standard tractricoid (a=2) using the standard metric.

The standard metric for the tractricoid with a=2 would be ds² = [4/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ^2). The area element is sqrt( g_r r g_θ θ - g_r θ^2 ) dr dθ. Since g_rθ =0, it's sqrt( g_rr g_θθ ) dr dθ = sqrt(4/(4 - r^2) * [4 r²/(4 - r^2) ]) dr dθ = sqrt( 16 r²/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) ) dr dθ = (4 r)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

The area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of (4r)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

So A = 2π ∫0^2 [4r/(4 - r^2)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u=4 - r², du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2. When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 4 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 4 ∫ (-du/2)/u = -2 ∫ du/u from u=4 to u=0 → 2 ∫ du/u from 0 to 4.

Which is 2 [ln(4) - ln(0)]. Oh wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges. That can't be right, because the tractricoid is supposed to have finite area. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the metric. Another source says the tractricoid's metric in polar coordinates is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r^2/a^2) for r < a. So for a=2, that becomes (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r^2/4) ) = 4/(4 - r^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), which is the same as the standard metric I thought earlier. So the area element would be sqrt( (4/(4 - r^2)) * (4 r²/(4 - r^2)) ) ) dr dθ = sqrt( 16 r²/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) ) ) dr dθ → 4 r/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

So the area is 2π ∫ (4r)/(4 - r^2) dr from 0 to 2. Which we saw gives a divergent integral. But that can't be correct because the tractricoid is a finite area surface. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the standard tractricoid's metric isn't as I thought. Let me check another source. Wait, perhaps the metric is different. Another approach: the tractrix has a certain parametrization, and when you rotate it around its asymptote, you get the tractricoid. The parametrization in terms of θ is x = a cos θ, y = a (sin θ + ln (tan (θ/2))) ), but perhaps it's easier to find the metric from the parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is finite and my calculation is wrong. Let me think about the integral again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [4r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r^2 → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [4r dr]/(4−r^2) ) = ∫ (4) * [ r dr / (4−r^2) ) ] = 4 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = -2 ∫ du/u. 

The limits: when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0:

-2 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du = 2 ∫ (from 0 to 4) (1/u) du. 

Which is 2 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ] → 2 [ ln(4) - (-infty) ] → 2 (infty) → infty.

But this can't be right, because the tractricoid should have finite area. So perhaps I'm using the wrong metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't for the tractricoid but for a hyperbolic plane, which does have infinite area. So the area of the given surface is infinite, so the answer is D.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere with radius 2, and thus the area is infinite. But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept. Let me think: a pseudosphere, or tractricoid, is a finite area surface with constant negative curvature. So the area should be finite.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric isn't for the entire pseudosphere but for a portion of it. But the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2', which I think refers to the entire surface. So if the metric leads to an infinite area, that would imply that the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, but that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Wait, but the denominator in the metric, 4 - x² - y², is positive for x² + y² <4, so it's the interior of a circle of radius 2. So perhaps the given metric is for a sphere of radius 2, but with a different scaling. But a sphere's area is 4π r², which would be 16π. But none of the options match that.

Wait, the options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x² − y²), D) +infty.

Hmm, the only option that makes sense based on my calculation is D, infinite. So perhaps the answer is D.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we analyze the metric. The metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), meaning the domain is valid for \( r < 2 \), where \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). In polar coordinates, the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2.
\]

Taking the square root, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the domain \( r \in [0, 2) \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward, yielding \( 2\pi \). The radial integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral transforms to:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 16 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{u} \, du = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). This indicates that the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). However, the given metric does not represent a pseudosphere, as pseudospheres are finite-area surfaces. Instead, the metric describes a surface with infinite area, as shown by the divergent integral.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
