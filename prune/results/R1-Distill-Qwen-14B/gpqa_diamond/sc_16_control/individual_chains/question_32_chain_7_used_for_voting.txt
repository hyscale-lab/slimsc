Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is asking for the energy of the nucleus X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. So first, I need to figure out what that nucleus is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so normally it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6, right? So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of a Li-6 atom.

Wait, but in these kinds of problems, do we use the rest mass energy of the nucleus? I think so. Because when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy is related to the rest mass energy. But let me think about the formula.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can calculate gamma for v=0.96c. Then multiply by the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

So first, let's calculate gamma. V is 0.96c. Let me compute 1 - v²/c². That would be 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then, the square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. But wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, 0.28 is the square root of 0.0784? Let me check that again. Because sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Hmm. I think the mass of a nucleus can be approximated by summing the masses of the protons and neutrons, but considering binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, but wait, in particle physics, the mass of a nucleus is often given in terms of the number of nucleons. Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c² each. So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's just the sum of the individual nucleon masses. But the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less due to the mass defect from binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 atom, but considering it as a single particle. So I'd need the atomic mass.

Wait, I think I might have to look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by using the mass of a single nucleon. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So, the nucleus is Li-6. So I need the rest mass energy of Li-6.

Hmm, I don't have that value memorized, but perhaps I can approximate it. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Because I remember that the mass of a carbon-12 atom is 12 u, and Li-6 is lighter than that. Wait, but wait, let me think: the atomic mass of Li is roughly around 7 for Li-7, but Li-6 is about 6.013 u.

Wait, but wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the sum would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3* (2.015941) )= 6.047823 u. But that's without the binding energy. The actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u, which is less than that because of the binding energy.

Wait, so the mass defect is 6.047823 - 6.013 = 0.034823 u. So the binding energy is about 0.034823 u * c². But wait, since we're dealing with the rest mass energy, we can use 6.013 u.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I might have another approach. The energy E is gamma * m * c^2. But since the problem is giving options in GeV, perhaps the rest mass is in GeV/c². So I need to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

So, let me think. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV/c². Similarly, a neutron is about the same, around 939 MeV/c². So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass energy would be approximately 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. That's the sum of the individual masses, but the actual mass is less due to binding energy. So the rest mass of Li-6 is actually a little less than 6 * 0.938 GeV.

Wait, wait, no. The binding energy is subtracted from the sum of the individual nucleon masses. So, the rest mass of the nucleus is (sum of individual masses) - (binding energy). But when we calculate the total energy, we're using the rest mass, including binding energy.

Wait, no. Because the binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together. So, when you calculate the rest mass, the binding energy is part of the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of its nucleons minus the mass energy of the released binding energy (if any) when they are bound. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as approximately the sum of the nucleon masses. Because in reality, the binding energy doesn't contribute much to the rest mass. Wait, but for precise calculations, it does matter.

Hmm, but maybe the problem is expecting me to use the mass of a single proton or neutron. Wait, no, because the nucleus is made of multiple nucleons. So perhaps the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the individual nucleon masses minus the mass defect due to binding energy.

But I'm not sure, and I don't have the exact value. Maybe in this case, the problem expects me to approximate the rest mass of Li-6 as 6 times the mass of a proton (since 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and their masses are almost the same). So 6 * 0.938 GeV = about 5.628 GeV.

But wait, earlier I saw that the mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Let me convert that into GeV. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 u is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me calculate that. 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. 0.013 * 931.5 is about 12.11 MeV, so 5.589 + 0.01211 = 5.6011 GeV. Wait, but that's the rest mass energy of the nucleus in GeV.

Wait, but wait, I thought the mass of Li-6 was 6.013 u, which would be 6.013 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that again more accurately.

6.013 * 931.5 = let's compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589. Then 0.013 * 931.5: 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.003 *931.5=2.7945. So total 9.315 + 2.7945 =12.1095. So total is 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011095 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of Li-6 is approximately 5.601 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I thought the sum of individual nucleon masses is about 6*(938 MeV) = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But the actual rest mass is less than that because some mass is converted into binding energy. So 5.601 GeV is the rest mass.

So getting back, the energy E is gamma multiplied by m c^2. So gamma is 3.5714, and m c^2 is 5.601 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.601 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 times 5 is 17.857, and 3.5714 times 0.601 is approximately?

Wait, 3.5714 * 5.601 = let's compute it step by step.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 * 0.001 = 0.0035714.

So adding these together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (approximately), plus 0.0035714 gives around 20.00357 GeV. But wait, that's only 5.601 GeV times 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, 3.5714 * 5.601:

Let me compute it more accurately:

3.5714 * 5.601.

Let me split 5.601 into 5 + 0.6 + 0.001.

So 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 * 0.001 = 0.0035714.

Adding those together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (exactly, because 17.857 is 17 + 0.857, 2.14284 is 2 + 0.14284, adding gives 19 + 0.99984, which is approximately 19.99984, so almost 20). Then adding 0.0035714 gives 20.00357 GeV.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. 3.5714 is about 3.5714, and 5.601 is about 5.6. So 3.5714 *5.6 = ?

Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 5.6:

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857.

0.6 *3.5714 = 2.14284.

Adding 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (exactly 20.000). Wait, but wait, 3.5714 *5.6 = 20.000 approximately. Hmm, but that's just 3.5714 *5.600, but the actual m c^2 is 5.601 GeV, which is 5.6 + 0.001. So the extra 0.001*3.5714 is 0.0035714, making the total energy E = 20.00357 GeV.

But wait, the options given are around 18, 20, 21, 23 GeV. So 20.0036 is about 20 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option B is 23.069. Hmm, none of the options are exactly 20.0035, but perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong mass for the nucleus. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should use the atomic mass, considering that the nucleus is a part of an atom. But in reality, the nucleus's rest mass is the same as the atom's, except for the electrons. So for a neutral atom, the rest mass is nucleus + electrons. Wait, but in high energy physics, when dealing with nuclei, they often consider the nucleus as a single particle, so the rest mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Wait, but for a light element like Li, it's three electrons. So maybe the actual mass is the atomic mass minus the mass of three electrons.

Hmm, that might complicate things, but perhaps for an approximation, the problem neglects the electrons' mass. So perhaps the rest mass is 5.601 GeV.

Wait, but when I compute E = gamma * m c^2, with gamma=3.5714 and m c^2=5.601 GeV, I get approximately 20.0035 GeV, which isn't one of the options exactly. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's not too far. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). v is 0.96c, so v^2/c^2 is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct. So perhaps the mistake is in the rest mass calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, Li-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.013 u. I used that to compute 6.013 * 931.5 MeV/c². Let me double-check the calculation.

6.013 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.013 * 931.5 = 12.11 MeV.

So total is 5589 + 12.11 = 5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV. So that's correct.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.60111 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.60111.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 * 0.00111 = approximately 0.003964.

Adding them together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0, plus 0.003964 gives 20.003964 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.004 GeV. But none of the options are that close. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, 20.004 is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: when dealing with heavy ions, the energy is usually given per nucleon, but in this case, it's the total energy for the entire nucleus. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are expecting a more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Let's see: 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784, yes.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula in terms of velocity and mass, but without using gamma. Wait, E = gamma m c^2 is the correct formula.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy, but the question says 'energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider', which typically refers to the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). Because in accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but sometimes the total energy is used. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says, 'the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So I think that refers to the kinetic energy. Because the total energy would be higher than the rest mass. But in this case, the rest mass is 5.6 GeV, and the options are higher than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, including the rest mass. Let me think: the problem says 'energy of the collider' which usually refers to the kinetic energy required to accelerate the particle. But sometimes, in high-energy physics, the total energy is used.

Wait, but wait. The formula I used gives the total energy (E = gamma m c²). So perhaps I should proceed with that.

But let me think again: perhaps the rest mass is not 5.6 GeV. Maybe I should take the individual nucleon rest masses, not the nucleus' rest mass. Because if the nucleus is moving, each nucleon's energy contributes, but wait, in reality, the nucleus is treated as a single particle, so its rest mass is the sum of the masses minus binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon, multiplied by the number of nucleons, but that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is a composite object.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the energy per nucleon in the nucleus. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass. Let me think again.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.013 u. So the rest mass energy is 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.013 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that more precisely:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.013 * 931.5 = 12.11 MeV.

So 5589 + 12.11 = 5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.60111 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.60111.

Let me break it down:

= 3 * 5.60111 + 0.5714 *5.60111.

3 *5.60111 =16.80333.

0.5 *5.60111 =2.800555.

0.0714 *5.60111 ≈ 0.0714 *5.60111 ≈ 0.4015.

So 2.800555 + 0.4015 ≈ 3.202055.

Adding to 16.80333 gives 16.80333 +3.202055 =20.005385 GeV.

So E ≈20.005 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single proton (or neutron) multiplied by the number of nucleons, not considering binding energy. Let's try that.

If each nucleon is about 938 MeV, 6 nucleons would be 6 *0.938 =5.628 GeV.

Then E = gamma *5.628 GeV =3.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.628 = ?

Well, 0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.028 *3.5714≈0.100.

So 2.14284 +0.100 =2.24284.

Adding to 17.857: 17.857 +2.24284 =20.09984 GeV.

So E≈20.1 GeV.

Ah, that's closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the rest mass as 6 times the mass of a proton (3 protons, 3 neutrons, each ~0.938 GeV), giving 5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.628 GeV =3.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute more accurately:

5.628 *3.5714.

Compute 5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.02 *3.5714=0.071428.

0.008 *3.5714=0.0285712.

Adding them:17.857 +2.14284 =20.0 +0.071428=20.071428 +0.0285712=20.099999≈20.10 GeV.

So E≈20.10 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be 5.628 GeV, using the sum of the nucleon masses.

So the correct answer would be approximately 20.10 GeV, which is closest to option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is the rest mass considered as 6 *0.938 GeV? Because the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering each nucleon as having a rest mass of 0.938 GeV, and the total rest mass is 6 *0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV, ignoring the binding energy.

So with that, E=gamma *5.628 GeV=3.5714 *5.628.

3.5714 *5.628 = ?

Let me compute 5.628 *3.5714.

Breaking it down:

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.02 *3.5714=0.071428.

0.008 *3.5714=0.0285712.

Adding up:

17.857 +2.14284=19.99984.

19.99984 +0.071428=20.071268.

20.071268 +0.0285712=20.0998392 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.10 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps there's a more precise calculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma calculation is more precise. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96 c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

Compute sqrt(0.0784): exactly, 0.28, as 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.571428571428571...

So gamma =3.5714285714.

Now, using 5.628 GeV as m c^2.

E=3.5714285714 *5.628 GeV.

Multiply 3.5714285714 *5.628.

Let me compute this precisely using decimal multiplication.

3.5714285714 ×5.628:

Let me break it down:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.02 =0.071428571428.

3.5714285714 ×0.008 =0.0285714285712.

Adding them all together:

17.857142857

+2.14285714284 =20.0000000 (exactly 20.0000000)

+0.071428571428 =20.071428571428

+0.0285714285712 =20.100000000000 approximately.

Wait, but that's an exact 20.1000000 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing some decimal points. Let me compute this with more precision.

Wait, 3.5714285714 ×5.628:

Let me compute 5.628 as 5 + 0.6 + 0.02 + 0.008.

So:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.02 =0.071428571428.

3.5714285714 ×0.008 =0.0285714285712.

Now, adding these with more precise decimals:

17.857142857

+2.14285714284 =20.000000000 (exactly 20.000000000).

+0.071428571428 =20.071428571428.

+0.0285714285712 =20.0999999999992.

Hmm, which is approximately 20.100 GeV.

But in the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I need to re-examine the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as 6.013 u, which gives 5.601 GeV, and then E=3.5714 *5.601.

Let me compute that precisely.

5.601 ×3.5714285714.

Compute:

5 ×3.5714285714 =17.857142857.

0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.001 ×3.5714285714=0.0035714285714.

Adding:

17.857142857 +2.14285714284 =20.000000000.

+0.0035714285714 =20.0035714285714 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.00357 GeV, which is approximately 20.004 GeV.

But none of the options match this precisely. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the problem is referring not to the total energy but the kinetic energy. Because sometimes, the energy given in colliders is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, the total energy is E = gamma m c². The kinetic energy is KE = (gamma -1) m c².

So if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then KE = (3.5714-1)*5.601 GeV =2.5714 *5.601 GeV.

So 2.5714 *5.601.

Compute:

2 *5.601=11.202.

0.5714 *5.601= approx 3.199.

Adding gives 14.401 GeV. But that's nowhere near any of the options. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than 20.10 GeV. Let me check if there's a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the gamma was miscalculated. Let me compute gamma using more precise sqrt(0.0784) value.

Wait, 0.0784 is 196e-4, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma=3.571428571428571...

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is being taken as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6 * 938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV, and then the energy calculation gives 3.5714 *5.628 GeV= approx 20.1 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.628 precisely.

5.628 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute 5.628 *3.5714285714:

Let me compute 5.628 *3.5714285714.

Breaking down:

5 *3.5714285714 =17.857142857.

0.628 *3.5714285714.

Compute 0.6 *3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.02 *3.5714285714=0.071428571428.

0.008 *3.5714285714=0.0285714285712.

Adding these: 2.14285714284 +0.071428571428=2.214285714268 +0.0285714285712=2.2428571428392.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.2428571428392=20.100000000 (exactly) GeV.

Wait, that's 20.100 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of decimal places or calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let me compute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) more accurately.

v =0.96c, so beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

Exactly, it's 3.571428571428571...

So no error there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 *5.628 GeV with more precise decimal places.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.628:

3.5714285714 ×5.628.

Compute each digit:

Let me write 5.628 as 5628 ×1e-3. So 3.5714285714 ×5628 ×1e-3.

But perhaps a better approach is to perform the multiplication step by step.

3.5714285714 ×5.628:

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714) ×5.628.

=3×5.628 +0.5×5.628 +0.0714285714×5.628.

3×5.628=16.884.

0.5×5.628=2.814.

0.0714285714×5.628= let me compute that.

0.07×5.628=0.394.

0.0014285714 ×5.628= approx 0.00808.

So total is approx 0.394 + 0.00808=0.40208.

So summing all parts: 16.884 +2.814=19.698 +0.40208=20.10008 GeV.

So E=20.10008 GeV, which is approximately 20.100 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher than our calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the rest mass calculation. Let me check the exact value of Li-6's rest mass.

Wait, looking up the exact atomic mass of Li-6, I find that it's approximately 6.013212 u. So 6.013212 u ×931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 ×931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013212 ×931.5 = ?

0.01 ×931.5=9.315.

0.003212 ×931.5= let's compute that.

0.003 ×931.5=2.7945.

0.000212 ×931.5= approx 0.1978.

Total 2.7945 +0.1978=2.9923.

So 0.013212 ×931.5=9.315 +2.9923=12.3073 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5589 +12.3073=5601.3073 MeV=5.6013073 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.6013073 GeV=3.5714285714 ×5.6013073.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×5.6013073.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.6013073.

Compute 0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.0013073 ×3.5714285714= approx 0.004645.

So 2.14285714284 +0.004645=2.147502.

Adding to 17.857142857 gives 17.857142857 +2.147502=20.004644857 GeV.

So E=20.00464 GeV.

But that's still not matching any of the options except perhaps none of the options exactly, but option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the gamma or rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving relativistically, and that the mass is different. Wait, but no, the rest mass is constant.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula for a particle with mass m, and the energy is E=gamma m c^2, but using the mass in a different way. For example, using the mass of the entire nucleus as the sum of the nucleon masses, including binding energy.

Wait, but earlier I calculated using the exact atomic mass, which includes binding energy, giving E≈20.0046 GeV, which is not matching any option except possibly none, but option C is 20.132, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the nucleus is given by E=gamma m c², where m is the rest mass.

But perhaps the problem expects the energy to be calculated per nucleon, but then multiplied by the number of nucleons. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is treated as a single particle.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, without considering binding energy.

So m =6 ×0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV.

E=gamma ×5.628 GeV=3.5714 ×5.628.

Which we've computed as 20.100 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Beta=0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

But perhaps I should compute it with more decimal places.

Wait, 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

Hmm, that's precise.

So E=3.571428571428571 ×5.628 GeV.

5.628 ×3.571428571428571.

Let me compute this with more precise steps.

5.628 ×3.571428571428571.

Compute 5 ×3.571428571428571=17.857142857142855.

0.628 ×3.571428571428571.

Compute 0.6 ×3.571428571428571=2.142857142857142.

0.028 ×3.571428571428571=0.100.

So 2.142857142857142 +0.100=2.242857142857142.

Adding to 17.857142857142855 gives 20.1000000000000 (exactly).

So E=20.100 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation, perhaps using more decimal places in the gamma and rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

Compute sqrt(1 - beta^2) more precisely.

1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So no, that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is being taken as 5.628 GeV (sum of nucleons), leading to E=3.5714285714 ×5.628=20.10 GeV.

But again, that leads to 20.10 GeV, not matching any option except perhaps if the problem expects rounding to four decimal places.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option B)23.069 GeV, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, each nucleon has energy gamma * m_nucleon c², but that approach is incorrect because the nucleus is treated as a single entity.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) and considering each nucleon's energy, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma using a more precise method.

Compute gamma =1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1-v²/c²=0.0784.

Compute sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma =1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is higher than I thought. Let me check the exact value.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.013212 u.

So 6.013212 u ×931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6.013212 ×931.5.

Let me compute this precisely.

6 ×931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013212 ×931.5 = ?

Compute 0.01 ×931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.003212 ×931.5 = ?

0.003 ×931.5=2.7945 MeV.

0.000212 ×931.5=0.197814 MeV.

So total for 0.003212 ×931.5=2.7945 +0.197814=2.992314 MeV.

So 0.013212 ×931.5=9.315 +2.992314=12.307314 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5589 +12.307314=5601.307314 MeV=5.601307314 GeV.

So E=gamma ×5.601307314 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 3.5714285714 ×5.601307314.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.601307314.

Compute 0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.001307314 ×3.5714285714 ≈0.004654.

So 2.14285714284 +0.004654=2.147511.

Adding to 17.857142857: 17.857142857 +2.147511=20.004653857 GeV.

So approximately 20.00465 GeV.

But again, this doesn't match the options given. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but it's still a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the rest mass of the proton (0.938 GeV) and neutron (0.9395 GeV), so summing 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3 *0.938 +3 *0.9395 =2.814 +2.8185=5.6325 GeV.

Then E=3.5714 ×5.6325.

Let me compute that.

3 ×5.6325=16.8975.

0.5714 ×5.6325.

Compute 0.5 ×5.6325=2.81625.

0.0714 ×5.6325 ≈0.4039.

So 2.81625 +0.4039=3.22015.

Adding to 16.8975:16.8975 +3.22015=20.11765 GeV.

That's approximately 20.118 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV).

But still not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of more precise values for gamma and the rest mass, leading to a slightly higher value.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.571428571428571, and the rest mass is 5.6013073 GeV.

So, 3.571428571428571 ×5.6013073.

Compute:

3.571428571428571 ×5.6013073.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.571428571428571 ×5 =17.857142857142855.

3.571428571428571 ×0.6013073.

Compute 0.6 ×3.571428571428571=2.142857142857142.

0.0013073 ×3.571428571428571.

Compute 0.001 ×3.571428571428571=0.003571428571428571.

0.0003073 ×3.571428571428571= approx 0.001097.

So 0.003571428571428571 +0.001097=0.004668428571428571.

So 0.6013073 ×3.571428571428571=2.142857142857142 +0.004668428571428571=2.1475255714285708.

Adding to 17.857142857142855 gives 17.857142857142855 +2.1475255714285708=20.004668428571425 GeV.

So E≈20.004668 GeV.

Still not matching any option except option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I used the wrong mass for the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 20.1 GeV, which would correspond to option C.

But I'm a bit stuck and time is limited, so I'll go with option C, 20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.013212 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.013212 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5601.31 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6013 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6013 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
3.5714 \times 0.6013 = 2.1475 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 17.857 + 2.1475 \approx 20.0045 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0045 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the rest mass or \( \gamma \) calculation.

ANSWER: C
