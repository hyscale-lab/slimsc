Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3. I need to determine how many possible products there are.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure of the starting material. The name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Because the 'd' doesn't make sense there. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-diethylaminobenzene? No, maybe the 'd' is a typo for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethyl benzene, which is also known as bromobenzene with two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 2,4 positions. 

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Alternatively, it's 1-bromo-2,3-dimethyl. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on that. But regardless, the reaction involves NaNH2 in ammonia. That's a strong base, often used in elimination or deprotonation reactions. In aromatic substitution reactions, NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation when there's a possibility of elimination.

Wait, but benzene rings with substituents—so if we have a bromide on the ring, and other substituents, the reaction might proceed via an elimination mechanism. Because with a strong base like NaNH2, the bromide could leave, but wait, benzene rings are aromatic and generally don't lose substituents via elimination unless there's a possibility of forming a more stable structure.

Wait, but benzyl halides can undergo elimination when treated with strong base to form alkenes. Wait, but that's when the halide is on a benzyl position, like benzyl bromide. But in this case, the bromide is directly attached to the benzene ring, making it a bromobenzene derivative. So that's different.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: in aromatic substitution, sometimes elimination can occur if there's a possibility of forming a more stable ring. Like in the case of 2-bromo toluene, treatment with a strong base can lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's more easily removed, perhaps leading to an elimination product.

Wait, but wait a minute. I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH2 in NH3. If the starting material is bromobenzene with methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, then the structure is like this: benzene ring with Br at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So it looks like a meta substitution pattern relative to the Br, but wait, position 1, 2, and 4 are adjacent. Wait, no, position 1 is where Br is, position 2 is adjacent, and position 4 is across from position 1 (since in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3, 4 are arranged so that 1 is opposite 4? No, in benzene numbering, each carbon is adjacent to the next. So position 1 is next to 2 and 6, position 2 is next to 1 and 3, position 3 next to 2 and 4, etc. So 1, 2, and 4 would have the Br and two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So that would be a 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. 

So the structure is Br at position 1, methyl groups at 2 and 4. Now, when this is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. So what reactions can happen here? The Br is a leaving group, but in an aromatic ring, substitution is possible under certain conditions.

Wait, but aromatic substitution usually requires specific activating groups. Bromine is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So perhaps the base isn't causing substitution but rather elimination. Wait, but elimination would require adjacent H and Br. So if the Br is in position 1 and there's a methyl in position 2, perhaps that can lead to elimination.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about the structure again. The Br is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So the positions are as follows: Br is on C1, CH3 on C2 and C4. So if the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, would that lead to elimination? But benzene rings are pretty stable, so would the base abstract a proton from C2 or C4, which are adjacent to the Br? So, for example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, then the Br and the H on C2 are adjacent. Then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, can a benzene ring form a double bond? Because that would disrupt the aromaticity. So that seems unlikely. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps this is an example of a benzidine-type elimination. Benzidine elimination is a reaction where a dihalobenzene loses two equivalents of HX to form a diene. But in this case, we have only one Br. So that might not apply.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's para to the Br. Wait, but in this molecule, the substituents are in positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 4 (CH3). So the para position to Br would be position 4, which has a methyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent via elimination. Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a deprotonating agent. It can also act as a base in elimination reactions. So maybe the bromide is eliminated, but how? If the molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from the adjacent position, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a conjugated system. So eliminating H and Br from adjacent positions would form a cyclohexadiene? But that would require breaking the aromaticity, which is not favorable unless the resulting structure is more stable. However, if the elimination forms a more stable diradical or a more stable alkene, perhaps it could happen.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but it's a meta director. If there are enough activating groups adjacent, perhaps the ring becomes susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but in our case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are activating (since they're electron-donating via the inductive effect). So methyl groups are ortho/para directors. So if the ring has Br and two methyl groups, perhaps the positions available for substitution are limited.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So maybe the reaction isn't a substitution but an elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. So removing H and Br from adjacent positions. Let's think: if the Br is on C1, and there's a CH3 on C2, then the base could abstract a hydrogen from C2, leading to the elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But then that would create a double bond adjacent to another double bond in the ring, which would disrupt aromaticity. Wait, but benzene is a conjugated ring of double bonds. If you have a double bond between C1 and C2, that's already part of the ring's conjugation. So maybe elimination isn't possible in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but deprotonation followed by some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is not 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene but something else. The name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2,4-dinitrobenzene? But without knowing the exact structure, this is challenging. Alternatively, maybe the 'd' is a typo, and the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-difluorobenzene. Or perhaps the substituent is diethylamino, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and when treated with NaNH2, it undergoes a dehydrohalogenation to form a new substituent. Wait, but in that case, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond and a methyl group. But that would require the ring to lose aromaticity, which is unlikely unless it's part of a larger system or if the ring can remain aromatic.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a diradical, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but as I thought earlier, the ring isn't activated enough for that. The presence of methyl groups (activating) and Br (deactivating) could have conflicting effects. So perhaps the ring isn't activated towards nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is an example of the Hunsdiecker reaction or something else, but that's more about alkyl halides.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible products when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with a strong base. For example, in some cases, amines can be formed via elimination, but that's when there's an adjacent leaving group and H.

Wait, wait a minute. I think I've heard of the formation of a benzene ring where a substituent is eliminated as HBr, leading to the formation of a new substituent. For example, in the case of 2-bromo toluene, treatment with a strong base can lead to the formation of benzene and a methyl group with a double bond. But wait, that's not possible because benzene is already a ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a styrene-type structure, but that would require breaking the ring, which is unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So if the Br is on C1, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 or C6, which are adjacent positions, then elimination could form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6. But then, the double bond would be part of the ring, so the ring would lose aromaticity, which is unfavorable. So that probably doesn't happen.

Wait, but perhaps a more stable structure could form. For example, if the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If the Br is replaced by something else. But what's the nucleophile here? NaNH2 in NH3 would provide NH2- as a nucleophile. But for nucleophilic aromatic substitution to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. In this case, the ring has methyl groups (activating, EDG) and Br (EWG). So the ring's activation for nucleophilic substitution would depend on the balance between these groups. 

Wait, the substituents are in positions 1 (Br, EWG), 2 (CH3, EDG), and 4 (CH3, EDG). So the ring's electron density would be influenced by these. The methyl groups are in the ortho and para positions relative to Br. Since methyl is activating, they would donate electrons into the ring. But Br is a deactivating group. So the overall effect might actually make the ring electron-deficient in some positions.

Wait, but nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically occurs when the ring is strongly activated. So without enough EWGs, the ring might not be reactive enough towards nucleophilic substitution. So perhaps this isn't the case here.

Wait, but maybe the base is causing the ring to lose H and Br, forming a new substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a different substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is aFries rearrangement, but that's for aryl esters. Not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is undergoing elimination with the base, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where Br is replaced by another group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products. If NaNH2 deprotonates the compound, where would it abstract a proton from? The most acidic protons would be those adjacent to the Br, perhaps. So if the ring has a Br at position 1 and methyl groups at 2 and 4, the acidity of the protons on positions 2 or 6 might be higher because of the proximity to the Br. Deprotonation could lead to an aryl anion, but that's not very stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group. Wait, methyl groups are not very acidic. The pKa of a methyl proton is around 48, which is much higher than what NaNH2 can handle (since NaNH2 is a strong base, much stronger than anything that can deprotonate methyl groups). So that's probably not the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms. 

Another possibility: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. When treated with NaNH2 in NH3, perhaps the methyl groups are deprotonated. But again, methyl protons are not acidic enough. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond. For example, if H is abstracted from C2, and Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. The ring would then have a double bond, but that's already part of the aromatic system. Wait, but that would disrupt the aromaticity. So that's probably not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a phenylene diradical, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination to form a benzene ring with a new substituent. For example, if the molecule loses HBr, perhaps forming a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the base induces the loss of H and Br, forming a benzene ring with a new substituent. But I'm not sure what that substituent would be.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with the substituents at positions 2 and 4, and the Br is eliminated. But how? I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but an aromatic substitution. If the Br is replaced by an amide group.

Wait, NaNH2 provides NH2^- ions. So perhaps the Br is substituted by NH2. But that would be a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, aromatic nucleophilic substitution usually requires activation by strong EWGs. In this case, the ring has two methyl groups (activating) and a Br (deactivating). The methyl groups are activating, which would make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, but not nucleophilic. So maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, I'm really not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible products again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in NH3, perhaps the product is 2,4-dimethylbenzene with the Br replaced by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hoffman-type elimination, but that's for amides.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a new ring structure. For example, forming a naphthalene derivative? But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces a benzene ring with a new substituent and the loss of HBr. For example, if the Br is at position 1 and a methyl at position 2, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. But that would mean the ring has a double bond there, which is part of the aromatic system. So the ring would have a double bond in place of the Br and the adjacent C. But wait, after elimination, the structure would have a double bond where the Br was. But that would lead to a loss of aromaticity, which is unfavorable. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring undergoes some kind of rearrangement. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. I recall that when toluene derivatives undergo reaction with strong bases, sometimes elimination reactions occur. For example, 2-bromo toluene treated with NaNH2 in NH3 can undergo elimination to form styrene, but that's for benzyl halides. In this case, the Br is directly attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of the Smith reaction or similar, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, leading to a new substituent on the ring. If the Br is replaced by an NH2 group, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But earlier I thought nucleophilic substitution isn't feasible here.

But wait, in some cases, when the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups, nucleophilic substitution can occur. The presence of two methyl groups (activating) and a Br (deactivating) complicates things. Maybe the ring's activation is sufficient in some positions for substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the base isn't acting as a nucleophile but as a deprotonating agent, leading to a benzene ring with an anion that could undergo some reaction. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Perhaps I should consider that the reaction produces a single product. So the answer might be 1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there are multiple products based on which substituent is eliminated or substituted.

Wait, going back to the structure: 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. The substituents are Br at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. When treated with NaNH2, a strong base, perhaps the Br is eliminated, but where would the H come from? If the base abstracts a H from position 2, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. But that would disrupt aromaticity. So perhaps the ring can't undergo such elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. So if the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But under what conditions would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but the product isn't aromatic. So perhaps the product is a non-aromatic compound, but that's less likely because aromatic stability is high.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't possible, but that's unlikely because the question is asking about the number of products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new substituent via a different mechanism. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group, but as I thought earlier, methyl protons are too weakly acidic for that.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and when treated with NaNH2, it undergoes a ring expansion or contraction. But I can't think of a typical reaction where that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products again. If the reaction leads to substitution of Br with NH2, then there's only one possible product. Because the substituents are fixed in positions 2 and 4. So the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So only one product.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps it leads to multiple products. For example, elimination could occur in more than one position, leading to different products. But I thought elimination isn't feasible here due to aromaticity.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent. For example, if the Br is eliminated along with a hydrogen from position 2, forming a double bond. But that would make the ring non-aromatic, which is not favorable. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a benzene ring with an amide group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to two products. For example, substitution at position 1 with NH2, giving one product, and elimination giving another. But I'm not certain if elimination is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products based on where the substitution occurs. But in this case, the substituents are fixed, so substitution would be only at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but a rearrangement. For example, a benzyne intermediate. But that's typically formed from dihalobenzenes undergoing dehalogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzyne intermediate, leading to the formation of different products. But for benzyne to form, you need two halides on adjacent positions. In our case, we have only one bromide. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the question says it's treated with NaNH2. So there must be a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but I'm not seeing how. Let me think of the structure again. Br is at position 1, which is ortho to the methyl groups at 2 and 4. The base could abstract a hydrogen from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between 1 and 2. But that would break the ring's conjugation. So perhaps the only possible product is substitution.

So perhaps the product is 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. That's one product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, could there be more than one product? Suppose the substitution occurs in a different position. But the Br is fixed at position 1. So substitution would only happen at that position, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, but I'm not sure if elimination is possible. If elimination is possible and leads to a product, perhaps that's another product. So maybe two products are formed: substitution and elimination.

But earlier I thought elimination isn't feasible, so perhaps only substitution occurs, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two products due to the possibility of different regiochemistry. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but a coupling. For example, the Br could be replaced by an amine group, but only one possibility. So one product.

So, after all this thinking, I think the reaction leads to only one product, so the answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The structure of the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. NaNH₂ is a strong base and can act as a deprotonating agent or facilitate elimination or substitution reactions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, with Br at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the methyl groups are electron-donating groups (EDGs).

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   NaNH₂ in ammonia is a strong base, typically used for deprotonation or elimination reactions. However, substitution reactions (e.g., nucleophilic aromatic substitution) require specific activation of the aromatic ring, which is not strongly supported here due to the mixed electronic effects of the substituents.

3. **Elimination Reaction**:  
   Elimination would require the abstraction of a proton adjacent to the bromine (e.g., from position 2 or 6) followed by the loss of Br. However, this would disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, making it highly unfavorable. Thus, elimination is unlikely.

4. **Substitution Reaction**:  
   Substitution involves replacing the bromine atom with another group. In this case, the nucleophile NH₂⁻ could replace Br. The presence of methyl groups (activating, ortho/para-directing) and bromine (deactivating, meta-directing) influences the reactivity of the ring. However, substitution at position 1 (where Br is located) is feasible, leading to the formation of 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

5. **Uniqueness of the Product**:  
   The reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material favor substitution rather than elimination. Since the substitution occurs specifically at position 1, only one product is formed.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces a single product, 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene, as substitution at position 1 is the only viable pathway under the given conditions.

Answer: B
