Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

Hmm, okay. So, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I remember that the formula for uncertainty is ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). But wait, I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

Wait, the given state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So if the state is expressed in that basis, then P_z is diagonal in this basis, and each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. Oh, wait, but wait—the state given isn't necessarily an eigenstate of P_z, is it? Because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z.

So, the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which is the computational basis here. So each component of the state vector corresponds to the amplitude in the respective eigenstate of P_z.

So to find the expectation value of P_z, I should perform the operation ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the given state.

Let me write down the state. The state |ψ⟩ is a column vector:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The matrix for P_z is given as:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to take the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩, multiply P_z, and then multiply by |ψ⟩.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. So the bra vector ⟨ψ| would be the conjugate transpose. Since the components are real numbers (looking at the vector elements: all are real except maybe when considering P_y, which has imaginary entries, but the state here is real?), so the conjugate is the same as the original.

So, ⟨ψ| is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this matrix multiplication step by step.

First, compute P_z |ψ⟩.

P_z is a 3x3 matrix, and |ψ⟩ is a 3x1 column vector.

Multiplying P_z and |ψ⟩:

First entry: (ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second entry: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0.

Third entry: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2.

So, P_z |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

⟨ψ| (P_z |ψ⟩ ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2 )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) = (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = - ħ/4.

Adding them up: (ħ/4) + 0 + (- ħ/4) = 0.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

Hmm, interesting. Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ to find the uncertainty.

The operator P_z squared is P_z². Let me compute that matrix.

P_z is diagonal, so P_z² will be each diagonal element squared.

So P_z² = [ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
             [0, 0, 0 ],
             [0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ]

Which simplifies to:

P_z² = [ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
          [0, 0, 0 ],
          [0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, I calculate ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Again, let's compute P_z² |ψ⟩:

P_z² |ψ⟩ = [ (ħ²)(-1/2), 0, (ħ²)(-1/2) ]^T.

Which is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

⟨ψ| (P_z² |ψ⟩ ) = (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: ( (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) ) = (1/2)(ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ²/2.

Thus, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 = ħ²/2.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance. So sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), so that's the answer. But let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can find the expectation value of P_z in another way, but I think the calculation is correct. The state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about normalization. The state must be normalized, right? Let me check the sum of squares of the absolute values of the components.

(-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the expectation value calculations are correct.

Alternatively, can I approach this using eigenvalues and eigenvectors? Since P_z is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. The state |ψ⟩ has components in those eigenstates.

The eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the three diagonal entries, which correspond to the basis vectors |+z⟩, |0⟩, and |-z⟩, assuming the middle component is 0.

So the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates. The coefficients are (-1/2)|+z⟩ + (1/√2)|0⟩ + (-1/2)|-z⟩.

Wait, but how does this help? Well, the expectation value of P_z in this state is the sum of each coefficient squared times the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, no, because expectation values involve the modulus squared of the coefficients multiplied by their eigenvalues. Wait, but the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis, so the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the coefficients and λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Let me see:

The state |ψ⟩ is written as c_1 |+z⟩ + c_2 |0⟩ + c_3 |-z⟩.

Here, c_1 = -1/2, c_2 = 1/sqrt(2), c_3 = -1/2.

The eigenvalues are λ_1 = ħ, λ_2 = 0, λ_3 = -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |c_1|^2 * λ_1 + |c_2|^2 * λ_2 + |c_3|^2 * λ_3.

Compute each term:

|c_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4)(ħ) = ħ/4.

|c_2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So (1/2)(0) = 0.

|c_3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding them: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. Which matches the earlier result. So that's correct.

Now, the expectation of P_z squared is ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. But since P_z² has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0, and (ħ)^2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = |c_1|^2 (ħ^2) + |c_2|^2 (0) + |c_3|^2 (ħ^2).

Which is (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Same as before. So variance is 1/2 ħ², so sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is (ħ/sqrt(2)), which is option B.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, take the inner product with $\langle \psi | = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, take the inner product with $\langle \psi | = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
