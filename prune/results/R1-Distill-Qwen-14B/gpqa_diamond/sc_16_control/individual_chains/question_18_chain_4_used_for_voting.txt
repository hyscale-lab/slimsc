Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, the ratio would be [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], I think. Or wait, is it the other way around? Well, I'll get to that later.

Let me read the problem again. So, Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about elemental abundances, which are ratios. Maybe the masses are just there as distractors or for another part of the problem that's not used here.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, the brackets mean logarithmic abundances relative to some reference. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. 

Wait, no, more precisely, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun, but no, wait, [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun). So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that can't be right because 12 is a big number. Oh, wait, maybe it's written as 12 + log10(nFe/H) =7.5. Wait, nFe/H is the number density of Fe over H. So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12? That would be negative. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Fe abundance can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the Sun's photospheric composition is 12 + log10(n_X / n_H) = value. For example, for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. That would make sense because the Sun's Fe abundance is about 7.5 when scaled from some reference.

Wait, but wait, I remember that the solar logarithmic abundance is usually around 7.5 for Fe. So nFe/nH in the Sun is 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. That makes sense because the Sun's metallicity is about 7.5 in log terms.

Same for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12 =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0 because it's the reference. Same for [Mg/H] for Star_2 being 0.

Now, let's process Star_1 and Star_2.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So [Fe/H]=0 ⇒ nFe/nH = nFe,nH_sun.

But wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe,nH_sun) =0 ⇒ log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe,nH_sun) → same as Sun.

So Fe is same as Sun in Star_1. So [Fe/H]_1=0.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is 0.3. Let's calculate [Si/Fe] in Star_1.

[Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

We know for the Sun, nSi/nFe is (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = (nSi/nH_sun)/(nFe/nH_sun) ) → (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, from the Sun's data, nFe/nH =10^(7.5-12)=1e-4.5.

Si is not given, but I can compute it. Or maybe I can find nSi/nH from the Sun's data. Wait, the problem says the Sun's photospheric composition is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So for Si, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe], but perhaps we can get it from other data.

Wait no, perhaps I can proceed without Si in the Sun. Let me think.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun +0.3.

But nFe in Star_1 is same as in Sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0. So nFe in Star_1 is same as Sun's nFe. So nFe = nFe_sun.

So nSi in Star_1 is nFe_sun * 10^{0.3 + log_Sun(nSi/nFe)}.

Wait, alternatively, nSi in Star_1 is nFe_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1.

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0.

So (nSi/nFe)_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

So nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) ) = 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

So the abundance of Si in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun's Si.

Wait, but wait, how is that possible? Because [Si/Fe] is 0.3, which is higher than the Sun, so Si is more abundant relative to Fe in Star_1.

Ok, so for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3 → so the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex.

Now, what about Star_2?

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. And [Mg/H]_2=0. So let's see.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)_sun.

Since [Mg/H]_sun is 7. So for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, which means nMg/nH = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So nMg_2 = nMg_sun.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun +0.3.

But in Star_2, nMg is same as Sun's. So:

log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) + 0.3.

Which is log( (nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) * 10^{0.3} ) ).

So nMg_2 = nMg_sun.

Thus, nSi_2 = nMg_2 * 10^{ -0.3 } / (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) )? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

nMg_2 = nMg_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg_2 / nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) = 0.3.

So log( nMg_2 / nSi_2 ) = log( nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) +0.3.

Take 10^ both sides:

nMg_2 / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun).

So nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )

But since nMg_2 = nMg_sun,

nSi_2 = nMg_sun / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) )) → simplifies to (nMg_sun * nSi_sun ) / (10^{0.3} * nMg_sun) ) → nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

So nSi_2 = nSi_sun / (10^{0.3} ) = 10^{-0.3} * nSi_sun.

So in Star_2, the silicon abundance is lower than the Sun's by 0.3 dex.

Now, the Sun's nSi can be computed because we know nMg, nFe, and some relation.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Mg/Si] or [Si/Fe], but I can compute them.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5, [Mg/H]=7.

What about its [Si/Fe]?

Wait, perhaps I can assume that in the Sun, the ratio of Mg to Si is a certain value, but without that data, maybe I can calculate it using the given nMg and nFe.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the solar [Mg/Si], which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the solar [Mg/Si] can be derived from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nMg/nH is 1e-5, since 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But what about nSi/nH?

Hmm, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun from other data.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide it. So maybe I'm supposed to find the ratio of nSi in each star relative to the Sun and then find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, but in Star_1, nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

In Star_2, nSi_2 = nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 would be (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2).

Wait, but if both stars have the same H as the Sun? Or perhaps not, because their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are same as Sun, but for Star_1 and Star_2, do their H abundances change?

Wait, [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, which implies that [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So for Star_1, nH_1 = nFe_1 * (nH_sun / nFe_sun) → since nFe_1 =nFe_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0.

Similarly, for Star_2, nH_2 = nMg_2 * (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) → since nMg_2 =nMg_sun.

Wait, this might be getting complicated. Let me try to express nH_1 and nH_2.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun ) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nH_1 = (nFe_sun / nFe_1 ) *nH_sun → but nFe_1 =nFe_sun → nH_1 =nH_sun.

So Star_1's H abundance is same as Sun's.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun /nH_sun ) → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nH_2 =nH_sun.

So both stars have the same H abundance as the Sun.

Therefore, nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun.

So, the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi_1 / nH_sun ) / (nSi_2 /nH_sun ) → which simplifies to nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Earlier, we determined that nSi_1 =10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

nSi_2 = nSi_sun /10^{0.3}.

So the ratio is (10^{0.3} * nSi_sun ) / ( nSi_sun /10^{0.3} ) ) → (10^{0.3}/ (1/10^{0.3} ) ) → 10^{0.6}.

What's 10^0.6? Let me calculate that. 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio is ~4.

Wait, but the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

So the ratio of Star_1 Si to Star_2 Si is ~3.9, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So in Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log_Sun(nSi/nFe) =0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun → nSi_1 =10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

In Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log_Sun(nMg/nSi) =0.3.

So nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun → nSi_2 =nMg_sun / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )) → nSi_2 = (nMg_sun *nSi_sun ) / (10^{0.3} nMg_sun ) → nSi_2= nSi_sun /10^{0.3}.

So the ratio is (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [10^{0.3} *nSi_sun ] / [nSi_sun /10^{0.3} ] = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is approximately 3.9, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition as a reference.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: 1.5 times the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex (Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun).

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: 1.2 times the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex (Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun).

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), so Fe abundance is the same as in the Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).
- Therefore, \( n_{\text{Si,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}} \).

#### Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), so Mg abundance is the same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).
- Therefore, \( n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} / 10^{0.3} \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}} / 10^{0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which is approximately 3.9.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
