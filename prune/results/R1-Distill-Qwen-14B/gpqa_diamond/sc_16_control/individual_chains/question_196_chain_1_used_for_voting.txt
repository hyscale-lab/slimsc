Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, but this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical equations of motion. I remember that in relativity, the equations change because of the gamma factor.

In the classical case, I know that the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). But wait, that's the classical result. Since this is relativistic, I can't use that.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is different? Or perhaps the equations of motion are modified.

Wait, but the problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So perhaps the potential energy is the same, but the dynamics are different due to relativity.

In the relativistic scenario, the oscillator's equation of motion would still be F = ma, but a is d²x/dt². So F = -kx = m d²x/dt². But in relativity, can we use that directly? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can use energy conservation.

Assuming energy conservation, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum speed, which occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but wait. In the classical case, maximum speed occurs at x=0 because that's when the potential energy is zero and kinetic is maximum. But in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA². So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy mc². Because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, it's not moving, so all energy is potential plus rest mass.

Wait, no. Wait, in the classical oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum x, and the kinetic is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy when the oscillator is at maximum displacement would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy? Or do we treat the potential energy as part of the total energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy remains the same as in the classical case. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about how the energy is treated.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But the potential energy might be part of the rest energy? Or perhaps it's considered separately. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to use conservation of energy. The total energy at any point is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. So when the oscillator is at x = A, velocity is zero, so kinetic is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is (1/2)kA². Wait, but in relativity, the minimum energy is mc², but if the oscillator is in motion, the energy would be higher. Or wait, no. If the oscillator is at rest, it's just mc². But when it's oscillating, the potential energy is part of the total energy.

Wait no, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)k x², so at maximum displacement x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy? Or is E the sum of the rest energy plus the kinetic and potential?

Wait, I think in this context, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Or perhaps the potential energy is considered part of the total mechanical energy, which in turn is part of the total relativistic energy. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential).

Wait, no. In relativity, the total energy includes the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is part of the total energy.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the total energy E would be mc² (rest energy) plus the mechanical energy (which is (1/2)kA² in the classical case). But wait, in the classical case, the mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², so E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that doesn't feel right because in the classical case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is mc². So when the oscillator is moving through equilibrium, the kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy would be mc² + (1/2)kA². But then when it's at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy would be mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that can't be right because the rest energy is mc², and the mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is the sum of the two. So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, the total energy is mc² plus (1/2)kA².

But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the mechanical energy is kinetic, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that's the same as before. So the kinetic energy at x=0 is (1/2)kA², which is the same as the classical case. But wait, relativity changes the expression for kinetic energy. So this approach might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². Hmm, then the total energy E would be (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. Therefore, E = 0 + (1/2)k A². But that would mean E = (1/2)k A².

But wait, that can't be right, because the rest energy is mc², which is much larger than (1/2)k A² for small oscillations. So perhaps the total energy is (1/2)k A² + mc².

Wait, but that would be the case if the oscillator's motion is in addition to the rest energy. So when the oscillator is at rest, E is mc². When it's moving, E is mc² plus the mechanical energy.

So, when at x=A, the mechanical energy is (1/2)k A², so E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position x=0, the mechanical energy is all kinetic, so E = mc² + (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc² + mc² = gamma mc².

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Let me try to write the energy equation.

At x=A, the velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero, but the potential is (1/2)k A².

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy: E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

At x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So E = (gamma -1) mc² + mc² = gamma mc².

But since E is the same in both cases, we have:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2) k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, that's an equation for gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But wait, let me write that as gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²). Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as some term, say, let's call it B for a moment. So gamma = 1 + B.

But wait, if B is small, then gamma is not too much larger than 1. But in any case, I can write it as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Let me compute the right-hand side:

[1 + x]^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2, where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2x + x².

But if x is small, x squared is negligible. But since the problem is relativistic, perhaps x isn't that small. Hmm, but perhaps I should proceed without approximation.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] + [ (k A²/(2 m c²) )^2 ].

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can invert both sides.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2.

Wait, that might be a better approach. Let me write it as:

1 - v²/c^2 = [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, no. Let me recompute. From gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Wait, perhaps simplifying the numerator:

( (1 + a)^2 -1 ) = (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a^2, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write this as:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Which is:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator is 2a + a².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator as a(2 + a).

Denominator is (1 + a)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm. Let me make a substitution. Let me call b = a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So,

v^2/c^2 = [ b (2 + b) ] / (1 + b)^2.

But this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I can find an expression for v_max in terms of c and the given parameters.

Wait, but the options given don't have square roots that look like this. Let me see the options again.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))² )

Wait, but wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

The main equation I have is:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

gamma is 1/ sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as D. So,

gamma = 1 + D.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + D).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

Which rearranges to,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

= [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expand (1+D)^2 = 1 + 2D + D².

So numerator is (1 + 2D + D²) - 1 = 2D + D².

Thus,

v²/c^2 = (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2.

Factor numerator: D(2 + D).

Denominator: (1 + D)^2.

So,

v²/c^2 = D (2 + D) / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm. Now, substituting back D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Hmm. Let's factor the numerator and denominator.

The numerator: (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Denominator: [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Let me write the denominator as [ ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

So,

Denominator = (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / (2 m c^2)^2.

Similarly, the numerator:

(k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the term inside the numerator's second part:

2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = [4 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2).

So the numerator becomes:

(k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * [ (4 m c² + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2) ] / [ (2 m c²) * (2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2) ] / (4 m² c^4).

Putting it all together:

v^2/c^2 = [ [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2)] / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ].

Wait, because denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2)^2.

Wait, denominator was [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]², which is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )² / (2 m c^2 )^2.

So when we invert and multiply, the numerator becomes:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) / (4 m^2 c^4) ] * [ (2 m c^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ].

So:

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) * (4 m^2 c^4) ) ] / [4 m^2 c^4 * (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ].

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the division properly.

So the entire expression is:

v^2/c^2 = [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

numerator = [k A^2 (4m c^2 + k A^2)] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

denominator = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v²/c² = [ numerator ] * [ 4 m^2 c^4 / denominator ]

Wait, no, more accurately, v²/c^2 is equal to numerator divided by denominator.

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A² )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

v²/c^2 = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] * [4 m² c^4 ) / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel out.

So,

v²/c^2 = [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me factor the numerator and denominator.

Notice that 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 - 2 m c^2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) squared.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Wait, 4 m c^2 is 2 * 2 m c^2, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor k A^2:

numerator = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

denominator = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, can I factor 4 m c^2 + k A^2 as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The options involve square roots and expressions involving (1 ± (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), etc.

Looking at option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no. Let me look at the options.

Option A: v=c√[1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m) )² ]

Wait, but that denominator doesn't have c². So perhaps that's for non-relativistic case. Hmm. Because (k A^2)/(2m) is the classical v_max squared.

Option B: v_max = c√[1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ].

Hmm, but that's a single term in the denominator. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this using the relation between velocity and acceleration.

Wait, the equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is more complicated. The equation isn't the same as F=ma. It's F = d/dt (gamma m v ), where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So F = -k x = d/dt ( gamma m v )

Which is a more complicated differential equation. Solving that might get me to the correct expression, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy is E = gamma mc². At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, and the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Wait, but that's only if the potential energy is (1/2) k A², which is the same as the classical case.

Wait, but that might not be correct in relativity because the potential energy in relativistic mechanics can be different. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)k A² as before.

So, E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

When the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum, and the potential energy is zero, so E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings me back to the same equation as before.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Hmm. Let me compute this expression.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as D. So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

Which can be written as:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1+D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2D + D^2) -1 = 2D + D^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2D + D^2) / (1 + D)^2.

Factor numerator:

D(2 + D) / (1 + D)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = D(2 + D)/(1 + D)^2.

Hmm. Let me take the square root to find v/c.

v/c = sqrt( D(2 + D) ) / (1 + D).

But D is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v/c = sqrt( [ (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ) / ( 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm. Let me try to simplify this expression.

The numerator under the square root is [ (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ].

Let me factor (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as D.

So,

sqrt( D (D + 2) ) / (D + 1 )

= sqrt( D (D + 2) ) / (D + 1 )

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

Looking for an expression that when squared gives v²/c² as I have.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c√(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match. Alternatively, let me compute option B.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt[ 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) ]

Wait, let's compute inside the square root.

1 + 1/(1 - D), where D is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

= [ (1 - D) + 1 ] / (1 - D )

= (2 - D)/(1 - D )

Hmm, so v^2/c^2 would be (2 - D)/(1 - D). But that doesn't match what I have.

From my calculation, v²/c^2 is [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

So, perhaps none of the options match this directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that can be simplified to this expression.

Looking at option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, but the denominator lacks c². So that option would be for a non-relativistic case, perhaps.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is the classical result, but that's not relativistic.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Hmm, let's compute the expression inside the sqrt.

1 - [1 / (1 + D)^2 ].

Which is [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Which is [1 + 2D + D^2 -1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

= (2D + D^2) / (1 + D)^2.

Which is the same as v^2/c^2 as I found earlier.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2 ), where D is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is option D.

Wait, let me recheck.

Option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is exactly the expression I have for v/c.

Because v/c = sqrt( [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2 ) ) = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1+D)^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy \( mc^2 \) and its mechanical energy, which is the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). The potential energy is given by \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is expressed as:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( D = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + D.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + D)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + D)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + D)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( D = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators that lack \( c^2 \), making them inconsistent with relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option C** corresponds to the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
