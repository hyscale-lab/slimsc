Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, right? So I think Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, maybe Ruthenium-based, which facilitates this process.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the formula is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2? No, wait, wait. Let me count the carbons:

Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait no, wait. Let me write it properly.

Actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me number from the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Because the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the chain is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons, yeah. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is at the first position, and there's a methyl branch on the third carbon.

But wait, the molecule is racemic, so it's a pair of enantiomers. But wait, can this molecule even have enantiomers? Wait, the molecule 3-methylpent-1-ene. If the double bond is at position 1, and the substituents on the double bond are CH3 (from C2) and a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, then is it possible to have E and Z isomerism? Or is the double bond between C1 and C2 such that the substituents are CH2CH2CH3 and a methyl group?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are two CH2 groups? No, wait, on C1 it's CH2 (from the double bond) and on C2 it's CH-CH(CH3)-... So maybe the substituents are CH2CH2CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3? I'm getting a bit stuck on that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as (CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, I think I'm complicating things.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the reaction. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis breaks the double bond and rearranges the substituents. The process typically involves the exchange of alkylidene groups. So the starting molecule is a substituted alkene, and the metathesis will break the double bond and form new ones.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, when treated with Grubbs catalyst, the double bond (between C1 and C2) will undergo metathesis. So the molecule could undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible, but since it's a straight chain, probably it's a ring-closing or a cross metathesis. Wait, but Grubbs is usually for ring-closing or for cross metathesis with another alkene.

Wait, but in this case, since it's a monomer, perhaps it's a ring-closing metathesis. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a five-carbon molecule. If it undergoes ring-closing, would it form a ring?

Wait, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the chain is five carbons long, with the double bond at the first position. So if it's undergoing ring-closing metathesis, it would form a ring. Let's see: when the double bond breaks, the two ends could connect to form a ring. So the chain is five carbons, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so if we break that and connect the ends, would we get a four-membered ring?

Wait, the chain is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So if metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bond and form new bonds. So perhaps the catalyst would take the two ends (the two CH2 groups) and reconnect them in a different way.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products of metathesis for this molecule. Grubbs catalyst often leads to the formation of the more substituted double bonds because of the stability, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic alkene. Let me count the carbons. The molecule has five carbons, with the double bond at the first position. So if the metathesis forms a ring, would it be a four-membered ring? Because the ends would connect.

Wait, the number of carbons between the two ends: if the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. The chain from C1 is CH2, then from C2, it's CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So to form a ring, the catalyst would need to break the double bond and connect the two ends. The chain is five carbons, so connecting C1 and C5 (the other end) would form a five-membered ring. Wait, that would require the chain to be of length four, because C1 connects to C5, which is four bonds away.

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis occurs between the two ends, leading to the formation of a ring. Let me think: in ring-closing metathesis, the two ends of the molecule combine to form a ring, breaking the double bond in the process.

So in this case, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the catalyst causes the ends (the CH2=CH- and the CH2-CH3) to combine, it would form a ring. Let me see: breaking the double bond, the two alkenyl groups would exchange.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible products. The metathesis reaction can lead to different products depending on how the catalyst facilitates the exchange.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst would cause the molecule to undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form cyclopentene derivatives, but considering the substituents.

Wait, but another possibility is that the molecule could undergo a cross metathesis if another alkene is present, but in this problem, it seems like it's just the same molecule reacting with the catalyst.

Wait, but no, the question says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs. So perhaps it's a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclic product. Let me think about the possible rings.

The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. If a ring is formed by connecting the first and fifth carbons, that would form a five-membered ring. But wait, the starting molecule is five carbons long, so connecting C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring?

Wait, let's model it. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3. So if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and during metathesis, the ends C1 and C5 could react to form a new double bond. So the new structure would be a five-membered ring with the new double bond where the ends were connected.

Wait, but let me think about how the metathesis works. The catalyst (Grubbs) would insert into the double bond, breaking it, and then the two ends can exchange. So the CH2 group from C1 and the CH3 group from C5 could swap partners.

Wait, maybe the product would be cyclopentane derivatives. But wait, the product would have a new double bond. Let me try to imagine the product structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a smaller molecule. Wait, another possibility is that the molecule could undergo a ring-opening metathesis, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products in more detail. Grubbs catalyst tends to promote olefin metathesis, which can lead to the formation of new alkenes.

In this case, the starting material is a mono-alkene. When Grubbs is used, the reaction could either be ring-closing metathesis if possible, or if the molecule can't form a ring, perhaps it would result in a different structure.

Wait, in the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps the ring closing would lead to a cyclic product. Let me try to figure out the structure of that product.

If the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the two ends would form a new double bond. So the initial structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. After metathesis, the double bond would form between C5 and C1, breaking the original double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but how would that work? The two ends would have to break and form new bonds. So the catalyst would cause the CH2 group from C1 and the CH3 group from C5 to swap partners.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a five-membered ring with a double bond. Let me draw it mentally. Imagine the chain folding so that the CH2 from the end (C5) connects back to the original CH2=CH-.

So the product would be cyclopentene derivative with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it would form bicyclic structures, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,5-dimethylcyclopent-1-ene or something like that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider another approach. Grubbs catalyst can cause the breaking of the double bond and the exchange of the substituents.

In the case of a symmetric alkene like ethylene, nothing would happen. But for an asymmetric alkene, like this one, the metathesis can produce different products based on how the substituents are arranged.

Wait, in the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The groups on C1 are two CH2 groups and the rest of the chain. Wait, no, the substituents on C1 are CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps on C1, the substituents are CH2 and the rest of the chain.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to see how many possible products can form from the metathesis.

The Grubbs catalyst can cause two alkenes to exchange substituents. But in this case, we have only one alkene. So perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst could cause the molecule to undergo a cross metathesis, but that requires another alkene. Since in this problem, the starting material is only 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps the reaction is a ring-closing metathesis leading to a cyclic product.

Wait, but another possibility is that the metathesis could result in different isomers. For example, if the product is a new alkene with different substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a mixture of alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think again. The initial structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. When Grubbs catalyst is added, the double bond breaks, and the two ends exchange.

So, the catalyst would cause the two ends (the CH2 from C1 and the CH3 from C5) to swap. So the new molecule would be CH2-CH3 connected to the other end, forming a ring.

Wait, but the exact structure depends on where the new double bond forms. So the product would be a cyclic alkene.

So the possible products would be different cyclic structures. But wait, the starting material is racemic, so perhaps the product would have stereoisomerism.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So ethene is a byproduct, perhaps from the exchange, but we're not counting that.

So, in this case, how many different products can form?

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would lead to two possible products because the starting material is racemic. No, wait, racemic refers to the starting material being a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But in this case, does the starting material have a stereogenic center?

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's check for any chiral centers. The third carbon (C3) has four different substituents: two CH2 groups (maybe?), no, wait. Let me number the carbons.

C1: CH2=CH-

C2: CH-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2-

C5: CH3.

Wait, C3 is connected to:

- C2 (from CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3)

- a methyl group (CH3)

- two CH2 groups? No, because C3 is CH(CH3)-, so substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)

- CH2CH3 (from C4?)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH-)

- a methyl group (CH3)

- two CH2 groups (from C4 and C5?), but I'm not sure. Actually, in the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH-), C4 (CH2), and two other groups?

Wait, perhaps C3 has the structure: it's connected to C2 (CH2=CH-CH-), then a methyl group, and then two CH2 groups (from C4 and C5). Wait, perhaps not. Let me draw the structure properly.

The molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the structure is:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2-

C5: CH3.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me number from left to right.

C1: CH2-

C2: CH-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2-

C5: CH3.

But wait, that would make the structure CH2-CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In this case, the C3 (third carbon) is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH-) and C4 (CH2). Wait, but how many substituents does C3 have?

- One substituent is the CH2 from C2 (since C2 is CH-CH(CH3)-...).

Wait, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH-)

- C4 (which is CH2-)

- a methyl group (CH3)

- and another CH2- group from where?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's just check for any chiral centers.

A chiral center has four different substituents. So looking at C3: If it's CH(CH3), then attached to it are:

- a CH2 group from C2 (since C2 is CH-CH(CH3)-...)

- a CH2 group from C4 (since C4 is CH2-CH3)

Wait, but if C3 is CH(CH3), then the substituents are:

- a CH2 group (from C2: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-...)

- a CH2 group (from C4: -CH2-CH3)

- a CH3 group (the methyl)

- and what's the fourth substituent? Oh wait, perhaps it's connected to the double bond. Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So for C3, the substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)

- CH2CH3 (from C4 and C5)

Wait, no, because C4 is CH2-CH3. So C3 is CH(CH3) connected to C2 (CH-) and C4 (CH2-), and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is connected to three different groups and a hydrogen. Wait, no, because the structure is CH(CH3), which implies that the carbon has a methyl group, and three other substituents.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The actual structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the third carbon (C3) is CH(CH3). The groups attached to C3 are:

- The CH2 group from C2 (since C2 is double bonded to C1 and connected to C3)

- The CH2 group from C4 (which is connected to C5, a CH3)

- A methyl group (CH3)

- And a hydrogen? Or is the hydrogen part of the CH(CH3) group?

Wait, no, CH(CH3) implies that the carbon is bonded to a methyl group and three other groups. So in the context of the molecule, those three other groups are:

- C2 (which is part of the double bond)

- C4 (which is CH2-CH3)

- and another CH2 group?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move on. The key point is whether the starting material has any chiral centers, which would affect the number of possible products.

If the starting material is racemic, it implies that the molecule has a chiral center, making it possible to have enantiomers. So if the starting material is racemic, then perhaps the product will have multiple stereoisomers.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to think about the metathesis product.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and connects the ends of the chain to form a ring. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the chain is five carbons, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

When Grubbs catalyst causes ring-closing metathesis, the ends (C1 and C5) would form a new double bond, creating a five-membered ring. So the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. Let me imagine this structure: the ring would have five members, with a double bond. The substituents would come from the original molecule.

So the product would be cyclopentene with substituents at specific positions. Let me try to count the substituents.

The original molecule was CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. After ring closing, the new ring would have substituents at positions corresponding to where the original double bond was.

Wait, perhaps the substituents would be at positions 1 and 2 of the ring. Let me think: when the ends C1 and C5 are connected, the substituents from those positions would form the new double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the new double bond is between C1 and C5 of the original chain, forming a five-membered ring with a double bond.

But I'm not entirely confident about the exact structure. However, the main point is that the metathesis leads to a cyclic product.

Now, the question is about how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene. So if the metathesis leads to a ring closing, how many different products can form?

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, which means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So any product derived from this would potentially have stereoisomerism.

Wait, but if the metathesis leads to a ring where the substituents are in a certain configuration, perhaps it would lead to different stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis results in the same product regardless of the starting enantiomer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently. Maybe the number of possible products is determined by the possible ways the molecule can undergo metathesis.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible metathesis products would include:

1. Ring-closing to form a cyclopentene derivative.

2. Alternatively, the metathesis could result in the formation of smaller alkenes. But since we only have one alkene, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes. Let's think about the possible new double bonds that could form.

Wait, another possibility is that the metathesis could lead to the formation of 1-methylcyclopentene or something similar, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis could produce two different products based on the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, since the starting material is racemic, the product could have different stereoisomers. For example, if the metathesis forms a new chiral center, then the number of possible products would double.

But I'm not sure if the product would have any chiral centers. Let me think about the possible product structure.

If the metathesis forms a five-membered ring, the substituents would be at certain positions. Suppose the ring is cyclopentene with substituents on adjacent carbons. If those substituents are different, then the product could have stereoisomerism.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure, so maybe I should think about the number of possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a single product, but considering the starting material is racemic, perhaps it leads to two products.

Wait, but the question says to exclude ethene, so ethene isn't counted.

Wait, another approach: Grubbs catalyst can cause the ring-closing metathesis of an internal alkene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a terminal alkene. So perhaps ring-closing isn't possible because the chain isn't long enough.

Wait, wait, no. The molecule is pent-1-ene, which is a five-carbon molecule with the double bond at the first carbon. So if we count the number of carbons from the double bond, the chain is long enough to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the chain has enough length to form a four-membered ring, but that's not possible because the chain is five carbons. Wait, no, because the metathesis would require at least two carbons between the ends to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would form a four-membered ring. So the starting molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the ends are connected, the ring formed would have four members. Wait, that's possible. Let me think.

The double bond is between C1 and C2. The chain is as follows: C1 (CH2), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3).

So if the catalyst breaks the double bond and connects C1 to C5, the new structure would form a five-membered ring. Because the chain is five carbons long, connecting C1 and C5 would create a five-membered ring with a double bond.

So the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. Now, considering the substituents, how many different structures can form?

In this case, the substituents on the ring would come from the original molecule. So the substituents would be in specific positions, leading to possible stereoisomerism.

Wait, but how many stereoisomers can the product have?

If the product is a five-membered ring with substituents that are in positions that allow for cis and trans configurations, then that would contribute to the number of products.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single structure, but considering the starting material is racemic, the product would have two enantiomers, so two products.

Wait, but the question asks for the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So perhaps each possible stereoisomer is a separate product.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure of the product. Another thought: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes. For example, if the catalyst causes the formation of different double bonds.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a terminal alkene. So the possible products might be the same regardless of the starting configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to only one product.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options given. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Wait, let me think about the possible products.

If the starting material undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the product would be a cyclic alkene. The question is whether this cyclic product has stereoisomers.

If the cyclic product has a double bond in a certain position, and substituents that lead to stereoisomerism, then the number of products would increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different products, each being a pair of enantiomers. So if the product is a pair of enantiomers, that would count as two products.

But since the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer leads to a different product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing metathesis leads to a single product, but considering the starting material's configuration, it would lead to two stereoisomeric products.

So in that case, the number of possible products would be two.

Wait, but the options have 2 as option D. So is the answer D)2?

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to more than two products. For example, if the ring can form in different ways, leading to different substituents.

Wait, another possibility: in addition to the ring-closing product, perhaps the metathesis could lead to the formation of more than one product because the catalyst can cause the exchange in different positions.

Wait, but I thought that ring-closing would be the main pathway here.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis could produce more than one product because the starting material has a chiral center and the reaction proceeds via different transition states.

Wait, perhaps the product has a new chiral center, leading to multiple stereoisomers.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the number of possible products is determined by the number of possible alkenes formed.

Wait, another thought: the racemic mixture could lead to different diastereomers, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different products, each with a different substituent arrangement, leading to four products in total (since each product could be a pair of enantiomers).

Wait, but the question asks for the number of possible products, excluding ethene.

So if there are two possible products, each with two enantiomers, that would make four products. But the question excludes ethene, so maybe ethene is a byproduct and doesn't count.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is only one structure, but due to the starting material being racemic, it produces two enantiomers, so two products.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes.

Wait, no, because the starting material is a single alkene, and with Grubbs, it's more about ring-closing.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis can lead to different products depending on how the catalyst facilitates the exchange.

Wait, perhaps the product is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with different substituents, leading to two products.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of products is two.

So, putting it all together, the number of possible products (excluding ethene) would be two, so the answer is D) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst typically promotes ring-closing metathesis (RCM) for terminal alkenes, where the double bond is broken, and the ends of the chain are joined to form a cyclic product. 

The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, a five-carbon molecule with a terminal double bond between C1 and C2. Upon treatment with Grubbs catalyst, the molecule undergoes RCM, forming a five-membered cyclic product. The reaction connects the terminal CH₂ group (C1) with the CH₃ group (C5), resulting in a cyclopentene derivative.

The product of this reaction is **cyclopentene with substituents**, where the methyl group (CH₃) and the CH₂ group are positioned on adjacent carbons in the ring. The stereoisomerism of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material. Since the starting material is racemic, it is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. This racemic nature leads to two distinct enantiomeric products after the reaction.

Excluding ethene, which may form as a byproduct but is not counted, the reaction produces **two possible products** corresponding to the two enantiomers of the cyclic product.

ANSWER: D
