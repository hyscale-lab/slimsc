Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

Wait, decay distance. Oh right, particles decay over time, and the mean lifetime is related to their decay width. But wait, mean decay distance... I think that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, I need to calculate the lifetime first and then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.

Right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the total decay width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me jot down the formula. The mean proper lifetime τ is ħ divided by the total decay width Γ. But wait, wait, actually, since particles are moving relativistically, the mean lifetime observed is longer than the proper lifetime. Oh wait, no, the proper lifetime is τ, and the observed lifetime is γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So I have to account for that.

But wait, the mean decay distance is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So, distance L = v * τ_observed. But τ_observed is γ * τ. So L = v * γ τ.

Alternatively, I think another approach is to compute the decay length using the formula L = c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c. Hmm, maybe that's the correct way.

Let me remember the formula. Oh yes, the mean decay length is given by L = c * β γ τ. And τ is ħ/(Γ). But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, another way to think is that the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ), and since the particle is moving at speed v, the mean path is v * τ. But then again, time dilation comes into play because the lifetime is from the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should break it down step by step.

First, calculate the proper lifetime τ0, which is τ = ħ / Γ. But since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert units so that ħ is in MeV·s. I remember that ħc is about 197.3 MeV·fm, but I'm not sure about ħ in MeV·s. Oh wait, I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, that would be 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, which is 6.582 × 10^-25 * 1000 MeV·s = 6.582 × 10^-22 MeV·s.

Wait, no, wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. To convert to MeV·s, multiply by 1000 (since 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV). So ħ = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So τ0 = ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV. So τ0 = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) = (6.582e-22) / 320 s. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-22 / 320 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ0 is about 2.057e-24 seconds.

But wait, this is the proper lifetime. The observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The gamma factor is gamma = E / (m c²). Wait, no, gamma is E / (m c²)? Or is it the total energy? Wait, the total energy of the particle is E, which is given as 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma is E/(m c²) when c isn't 1. But in natural units, c=1, so gamma is E/m.

So E_X = 8 GeV, m_X =1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667. Then the observed lifetime τ = gamma * tau_0. So tau = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Tau is the proper lifetime, so the observed lifetime is gamma times that. So tau_obs = gamma * tau_0. So that's correct.

Now, the particle is moving at velocity v. Beta is v/c. Since gamma is 6.6667, and beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). Let me compute beta.

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444. So 1/gamma^2 is ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ approximately 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) = 1 - (9/400) = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 =0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.988694. So beta≈0.9887.

So the velocity v is beta c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length is distance L = v * tau_obs. So v is 2.966e8 m/s, tau_obs is 1.371e-23 s.

So L = 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = let's compute that.

2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8.

1.371e-23 is 1.371 * 1e-23.

Multiply 2.966 *1.371 ≈ approx 4.063.

Then 1e8 * 1e-23 is 1e-15.

So L ≈ 4.063e-15 meters.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm. So my approximate calculation gives about 4.06e-15 m. Which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So I think the correct answer is B.

But wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me redo the calculation with more precise steps.

Compute tau0 first:

tau0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) ?

Wait, no, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.320 GeV. Oh wait, 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

So tau0 = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.320 s.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approx 2.056875e-24 seconds, as before.

Gamma is E/m = 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

Tau_obs = gamma * tau0 = 6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.371e-23 s.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - ( (3/20)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me calculate that more accurately.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute:

We know that 0.988^2 = (approx) 0.976144. 0.989^2 is 0.978121. Wait, 0.9887^2: let's compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0226 + 0.000128 ≈ 0.977528. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

So velocity v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Then L = v * tau_obs = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = ?

Let me calculate 2.9661e8 * 1.371e-23:

Multiply 2.9661 * 1.371 = let's compute this accurately.

2.9661 * 1.371:

Break it down:

2.9661 * 1 = 2.9661

2.9661 * 0.3 = 0.88983

2.9661 * 0.07 = 0.207627

2.9661 * 0.001 = 0.0029661

Adding them up:

2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593

+ 0.207627 → 4.063557

+ 0.0029661 → 4.066523.

So approximately 4.0665e... Wait, the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15. So the result is 4.0665e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, very close. So why is there a discrepancy? Perhaps because I used approximate values for beta and gamma.

Wait, let me check the calculations again for more precision.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... exactly 20/3.

So gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9886941854.

So more accurately, beta is approximately 0.988694.

So velocity v = 0.988694 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966082e8 m/s.

Tau_obs is gamma * tau0.

Tau0 is (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 20/3 → tau_obs = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) /3 = (41.1375e-24)/3 ≈13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So L = v * tau_obs = (2.966082e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s).

Let me compute 2.966082e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Break into two parts:

2.966082 *1.37125 = ?

Let me compute 2.966082 * 1.37125.

First, compute 2.966082 * 1.37125.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute this as:

2.966082 * 1.37125 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 2.966082 * 1.37125.

Wait, 2.966082 times 1.37125 can be calculated as follows:

2.966082 * 1 = 2.966082

2.966082 * 0.3 = 0.8898246

2.966082 * 0.07 = 0.20762574

2.966082 * 0.001 = 0.002966082

2.966082 * 0.00025 = 0.0007415205

So adding all:

2.966082

+0.8898246 → 3.8559066

+0.20762574 →4.06353234

+0.002966082 →4.066498422

+0.0007415205 →4.06724. So approximately 4.06724.

So 2.966082 *1.37125 ≈4.06724.

So 4.06724e(8-23) →4.06724e-15 meters.

Wait, 1e8 *1e-23 is 1e-15, so 4.06724e-15 m.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, my calculation is about 4.067e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15. So perhaps a slight discrepancy due to more precise calculation steps or perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with ħ. I used 6.582e-25 GeV·s for ħ. Let me check the exact value.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But it's sometimes given as 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps it's more precise as 6.5823×10^-25 GeV·s. So using more precise numbers might get a more accurate result.

Let me recalculate tau0 with ħ =6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Tau0 = (6.5823e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = 6.5823e-25 /0.32 = let's compute that.

6.5823 /0.32 =20.5696875 → so 20.5696875e-25 → 2.05696875e-24 seconds.

Tau_obs = gamma * tau0 = (20/3) * 2.05696875e-24 = (20 * 2.05696875e-24)/3 → 41.139375e-24 /3 →13.713125e-24 =1.3713125e-23 s.

v = beta * c = 0.988694 * 3e8 m/s → 2.966082e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau_obs = (2.966082e8 m/s) * (1.3713125e-23 s) = ?

Multiplying 2.966082 *1.3713125.

Let me compute 2.966082 *1.3713125.

Let me compute it:

1.3713125 * 2.966082.

Let me compute step by step:

1.3713125 * 2 = 2.742625

1.3713125 * 0.9 = 1.23418125

1.3713125 * 0.06 = 0.08227875

1.3713125 * 0.006 = 0.008227875

1.3713125 * 0.000082 = approximately 0.00011218.

Adding them up:

2.742625

+1.23418125 → 3.97680625

+0.08227875 →4.059085

+0.008227875 →4.067312875

+0.00011218 →4.067425055.

So approximately 4.067425.

So L = 4.067425e-15 m.

But the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close to my result of ~4.0674e-15. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculation of beta and gamma or the exact value of ħ.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another way to compute the decay length is to use the formula L = (c * ħ) * (E) / (Γ * m).

Wait, let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ/(Γ). But considering relativistic effects, the mean path would be L = v τ gamma? Or another approach is to use L = (c * ħ) * (E) / (Gamma * m).

Wait, perhaps another formula exists. Let me think: the mean path is given by L = c * tau_obs * beta gamma.

Wait, tau_obs is gamma tau0, which is gamma (ħ/Γ). So L = c * beta gamma (ħ/Γ).

But beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma = gamma (v/c). Wait, but v = beta c, so beta gamma = gamma beta.

Wait, but that's the same as gamma beta. Alternatively, since gamma beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)} )? Not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the formula.

So L = c * beta gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, but let me compute beta gamma. Since gamma is E/(m c²), and beta is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) → sqrt(1 - m²/(E²)).

Wait, in natural units where c=1, beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ), gamma = E/m.

So beta gamma = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) * (E/m) ) = sqrt( (E² - m²)/E² ) * (E/m) ) = sqrt( (E² - m^2) ) / m.

So L = c * (sqrt(E² - m²)/ m ) * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, but E is given in GeV, m in GeV, ħ is in GeV·s, and c is in m/s.

Hmm, let me compute each part.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² - m² =64 - 1.44 =62.56 (GeV²).

sqrt(E² - m²)= sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So beta gamma = 7.91 / 1.2 ≈6.5916667.

Now, L = c * (beta gamma) * (ħ / Γ).

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.320 GeV.

So compute each part:

beta gamma is 6.5916667.

ħ/Γ =6.582e-25 /0.320 ≈2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.5916667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 3e8 * 6.5916667 = 1.9775e9.

Then 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

1.9775e9 = 1.9775 ×1e9.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 ×1e-24.

Multiplying: 1.9775 *2.056875 ≈4.067 (as before).

Exponents:1e9 *1e-24 =1e-15.

So L ≈4.067e-15 m. So same result as earlier.

So the correct option is B) 4.0655e-15 m. But my calculation gives ~4.067e-15. There's a slight difference, but perhaps the exact value of ħ is a bit different, or perhaps the calculation uses more precise steps.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta gamma more precisely. Let me recalculate beta gamma.

Gamma is 8 /1.2 =6.666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988694185.

So beta gamma =6.666666667 *0.988694185 ≈6.666666667 *0.988694185.

Let me compute this accurately.

6.666666667 *0.988694185:

Approximately 6.666666667 * 0.988694 ≈6.666666667 *0.988694.

Compute 6.666666667 *0.988694:

6 *0.988694 =5.932164.

0.666666667 *0.988694 ≈0.666666667 *0.988694.

0.666666667 *0.988694 = (approx) 0.666666667 *0.988694.

Let me compute that:

0.666666667 * 0.988694 ≈ 0.659129334.

So total beta gamma ≈5.932164 +0.659129334 ≈6.591293334.

So L = c * beta gamma * (ħ/Γ).

c=3e8 m/s.

beta gamma=6.591293334.

ħ=6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Γ=0.320 GeV.

So ħ/Γ=6.5823e-25 /0.320=2.05696875e-24 s.

So L =3e8 *6.591293334 *2.05696875e-24.

Compute 3e8 *6.591293334 =1.9773880002e9.

Multiply by 2.05696875e-24:

1.9773880002e9 *2.05696875e-24 = (1.9773880002 *2.05696875) * 1e9 *1e-24.

1.977388 *2.05696875 = let's compute that.

1.977388 *2.05696875.

Let me compute 1.977388 *2 =3.954776.

1.977388 *0.05696875 = let's compute:

0.05 *1.977388=0.0988694

0.00696875 *1.977388≈0.01379916.

Adding: 0.0988694 +0.01379916 ≈0.11266856.

So total ≈3.954776 +0.11266856≈4.06744456.

So L≈4.06744456e-15 meters.

Hmm, so the answer I get is approximately 4.0674e-15 meters. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So perhaps the exact value depends on using more precise values for constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta gamma. Let me compute beta gamma again.

beta gamma = (E^2 - m^2)^0.5 / m.

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E^2 - m^2 =64 -1.44=62.56 GeV².

sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

beta gamma =7.91 /1.2 =6.591666667.

So beta gamma is exactly 6.591666667.

Now, compute L = c * beta gamma * (ħ/Γ).

c=3e8 m/s.

beta gamma=6.591666667.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma=0.320 GeV.

So, ħ/Γ =6.582e-25 /0.320 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L=3e8 *6.591666667 *2.056875e-24.

Breaking it down:

3e8 *6.591666667 = 1.9775e9.

1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9775 *2.056875.

Let me compute 2 *2.056875 = 4.11375.

Subtract 0.0225 *2.056875 → 0.0225 *2.056875 =0.046284375.

So 4.11375 -0.046284375 ≈4.067465625.

So L≈4.067465625e-15 m.

The options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

So the computed value is 4.067465625e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). The slight discrepancy might be due to using more precise ħ value or rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use the production energy, but I think the approach is correct.

So, the correct answer is B)4.0655e-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \gamma \cdot \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Proper Lifetime
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \)

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Observed Lifetime
The observed lifetime \( \tau_{\text{obs}} \) is related to the proper lifetime by:

\[
\tau_{\text{obs}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0
\]

\[
\tau_{\text{obs}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Velocity (\( \beta \))
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.988694
\]

### Step 5: Decay Length
The decay length \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau_{\text{obs}}
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{obs}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Refinement Using \( \beta \gamma \)
Using the formula \( L = c \cdot \beta \gamma \cdot \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \beta \gamma = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \), we compute:

\[
\beta \gamma = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 - m^2}{m^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{m}
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E^2 - m^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \, \text{GeV}^2
\]

\[
\sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
\beta \gamma = \frac{7.91}{1.2} \approx 6.5917
\]

Now, substitute into \( L \):

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \gamma \cdot \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.5917 \cdot \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320}
\]

First, compute \( \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \):

\[
\frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

Then, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.5917 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]

\[
L = 4.0674 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 7: Final Answer
The computed decay length \( L \approx 4.0674 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option \( B \) (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or more precise constants.
