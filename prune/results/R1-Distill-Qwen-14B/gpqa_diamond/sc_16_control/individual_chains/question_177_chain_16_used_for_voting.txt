Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves stars and their luminosities. Oh right, luminosity has to do with how much light they emit. I remember that stars emit light based on their temperature and size, right? Oh wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths. Oh, that must relate to their temperatures. Because hotter stars emit most of their light at shorter wavelengths, like blue, while cooler ones are red. So if they have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, the problem says that Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelengths. So according to black body radiation, that would mean they have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. Got it.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. The problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by some factor. So we need to compute L1 / L2.

Given that L = 4πR²σT⁴, but since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R squared. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Because T cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, the stars' radii are given. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So substituting into the ratio, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23, which is close but maybe something else is going on.

Wait, wait. Oh, but wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect things? Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. If a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted, moving away would cause redshift. But the question says that the peak wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that might affect the observed wavelength, but the peak wavelengths are the same when measured. Hmm, but wait, the peak wavelengths they measured are the same. So when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is affected by Doppler shift, but the actual blackbody emission peak would be at a different rest wavelength.

Wait a second, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So when you observe a star moving towards you, the light is blueshifted, so the peak would appear at a shorter wavelength. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_2, which is moving away (since radial velocity is positive 700 km/s, meaning moving away?), wait, no, radial velocity of 700 km/s could be either towards or away, depending on the sign. Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is not moving with respect to us (radial velocity 0), and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. 

So, if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the rest frame of Star_1 and Star_2 must have different temperatures, but when observed, their emission peaks are at the same wavelength.

Wait, this complicates things. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its emission is redshifted. So the observed wavelength λ' = λ * (1 + v/c), assuming v is small compared to c. But the observed λ' for both stars is the same. So Star_2's rest frame λ is shorter than what we observe. Because it's moving away, so its λ' is longer. So for Star_2, the rest λ (λ2) is λ_observed * (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)? Wait, no, I might be getting that wrong. Let me think again.

The Doppler effect for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the recession velocity (positive for moving away). So Star_1's λ_obs1 is λ_rest1, since v=0. Star_2's λ_obs2 is λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). But the problem says λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). 

But since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, that implies that their rest wavelengths are different. Because Star_2's emission peak is at a higher wavelength in its rest frame, but due to its motion, it's redshifted to match Star_1's observed wavelength.

Wait, but earlier I thought that since the observed wavelengths are the same, the two stars must have the same temperature. But that can't be the case because Star_2's rest temperature would be different. Wait, this is getting tricky. Let me try to formalize it.

The peak wavelength λ_peak is inversely proportional to the temperature of the star (λ_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant). So if the observed λ_peak is the same for both stars, but Star_2 is moving away, what does that mean about their actual temperatures?

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + v1/c). Since v1=0, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So substituting, b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c).

Rearranged: T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)^{-1}.

So T2 = T1 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v2/c). The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.002333... times c. So 1 + 0.002333 is about 1.002333.

So T2 is approximately T1 / 1.002333. Which is about 0.99767 * T1.

So T2 is slightly less than T1.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 and T2 were the same because λ_obs was same, but this shows that's not the case. So earlier assumption was wrong. So the stars don't have the same temperature in their rest frames. So that affects the luminosity calculation.

Wait, so how do we compute L1 and L2 now?

Luminosity is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

We also know T2 = T1 / (1 + v2/c).

So let me plug that in.

T1^4 / T2^4 = [T1^4] / [ (T1/(1 + v2/c))^4 ] = (1 + v2/c)^4.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (1 + v2/c)^4.

Wait, let me compute that.

v2 is 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700/3e5 is 0.002333...

So (1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

Raising that to the fourth power: (1.002333)^4 ≈ ?

Let's calculate this. Let me compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002329.

Multiply by 4: 0.009316.

Exponentiating: e^0.009316 ≈ 1.00937.

So approximately 1.00937.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00937.

So now, the factor (1.5)^2 is 2.25. Multiply by 1.00937: 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.272.

Wait, but the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

So 2.27 is close to option B (2.32) and option D (2.23). Hmm, maybe my approximation is too rough.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step.

1.002333^2 = ?

Compute 1.002333 * 1.002333:

Approximate as (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Then, square that to get to power 4.

So (1.00467144)^2.

Again using (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x + x², where x=0.00467144.

So 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182.

So about 1.0093647.

So more accurately, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So 2.25 * 1.009365 ≈ ?

2.25 * 1.009365 = 2.25*(1 + 0.009365) = 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.009365).

2.25 * 0.009365 ≈ 0.02106. Adding to 2.25 gives 2.27106.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but that's a bit lower. Option B is 2.32, which is higher. Wait, but perhaps my calculation is missing something.

Wait, let me think again about the Doppler shift. Because I used the approximation (1 + v/c), but for more precise calculation, perhaps I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) ) for transverse motion, but radial is different. No, wait, no. The exact Doppler shift formula when the source is moving directly away is λ' = λ * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the exact formula.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler effect for light when the source is moving away is given by:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait no, maybe it's (1 + v/c) when v is small. Because for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift can be approximated as λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c).

But when v is not negligible, the exact formula is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, I might be getting confused between the relativistic and non-relativistic Doppler shifts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the exact formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving away.

The formula is:

λ' = λ * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) )

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me think again. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for a source moving away is:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should look it up but since I can't right now, I'll try to remember. Alternatively, the relation between observed frequency and source frequency is:

f' = f * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Because when the source is moving away, the observed frequency is lower. So the observed wavelength would be λ' = c/(f') = c/(f * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )) ) = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

So for small v, this reduces to λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c ), which is what I used earlier.

So for v = 700 km/s, let's compute the exact Doppler shift.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.00233333.

So sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = sqrt( (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) ) ).

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 1.0023333.

Denominator: 0.9976667.

So (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) ≈ (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) = approx 1.004664.

Then sqrt(1.004664) ≈ 1.00233.

So λ' = λ * 1.00233.

So the observed wavelength of Star_2 is longer by a factor of 1.00233 compared to the source's rest wavelength.

But since the observed wavelength of Star_1 is λ_rest1, and for Star_2 it's λ_rest2 * 1.00233, and these are equal:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 1.00233.

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature: λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.00233.

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.00233.

So T2 = T1 * (1 / 1.00233) ≈ T1 * 0.99767.

So T2 ≈ 0.99767 T1.

So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit lower than Star_1.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

T1 / T2 = 1 / 0.99767 ≈ 1.00233.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00233)^4 ≈ ?

Earlier, when I used the approximation, I thought it's 1.00936, but perhaps with the exact value, let's compute (1.00233)^4.

Let me compute 1.00233^2 first.

1.00233 * 1.00233 = ?

Let me compute 1.00233 squared.

(1 + 0.00233)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 1.0046654289.

Then, squaring that:

(1.0046654289)^2 = ?

Let me compute (1 + 0.0046654289)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*0.0046654289 + (0.0046654289)^2.

So 1 + 0.0093308578 + 0.00002176 ≈ 1.0093526.

So 1.0046654289^2 ≈ 1.0093526.

So (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0093526.

So the ratio T1^4 / T2^4 = (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.2707.

So approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, and option B is ~2.32.

Wait, but 2.27 is closer to 2.25 (option A) than 2.23, but option A is 2.25, which was the case without considering the Doppler shift. Hmm, but I've accounted for the Doppler shift, and the factor is about 2.27.

But none of the options exactly match that. The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C)2.35, D) 2.23.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Doppler effect? Because the problem says that the stars' peak wavelengths as observed are the same. So perhaps the assumption is that their rest temperatures are the same.

Wait, that would be the case if the stars are at the same temperature in their rest frames but their observed wavelengths are same. But if Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength would shift, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same. So that would require that Star_2's rest wavelength is shorter, so that when Doppler shifted, it appears the same as Star_1.

But if that's the case, then T1 and T2 are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the Doppler effect and assume T1 = T2. Because if I do that, then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem statement gives the radial velocities, which must be relevant. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-express the problem.

The problem says:

Astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... ?

Assuming the stars radiate as black bodies.

Wait, so perhaps the key is that the luminosity is calculated based on their rest frame properties, not the observed.

Wait, but the observed brightness depends on the distance, but the problem doesn't mention distance. Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the observed wavelengths to find the temperatures, which are then used to compute luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the luminosity using the observed data, including the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the stars' temperatures are the same in their rest frames, but due to Doppler shift, their observed wavelengths are same. Wait, that can't be, because if T is same, then λ_rest is same, but with Doppler shift, their observed wavelengths would differ unless v=0.

Alternatively, the problem might be that the stars have same observed temperatures (same observed λ_peak), but their rest temperatures are different. Because of their velocities, their observed λ_peak is same.

Wait, but how does that affect the calculation of their luminosity?

Because luminosity depends on rest temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the observed λ_peak to find T_observed, but that would be incorrect because the observed λ_peak is shifted by Doppler.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using black body radiation, so maybe they used the observed λ_peak to find T, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars' rest wavelengths are same, but the observed are same, which would imply T1 = T2.

But that can't be because Star_2's emission is redshifted. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the luminosity ratio based on the rest properties, but using the observed data to find the rest properties.

Wait, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let me read the problem again.

Problem Statement:

Astronomers observed that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. They computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. They found that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor of...

So, the astronomers used the observed wavelengths to determine T, but perhaps that's incorrect because of Doppler shift. But the problem states that they used the observed wavelengths to compute luminosity.

Wait, but according to black body radiation, the luminosity calculation would include the star's actual (rest frame) temperature, but if the observed λ_peak is used, it would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that the observed λ_peak is the same, so the stars have same observed temperatures, but their rest temperatures are different. But the luminosity depends on their rest temperatures.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, which was to assume T1 = T2 because observed λ_peak is same. But that would ignore Doppler effects, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25.

But the problem introduces the radial velocities, which must affect the calculation. So perhaps I'm to account for the fact that the observed λ_peak is same, but the rest T is different.

Let me think again.

The observed λ_peak for both stars is same, but the rest λ_peak are different because of their velocities.

So for Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = same as λ_obs2.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

So λ_rest2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c).

So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest = b / T.

So T_rest1 = b / λ_rest1.

T_rest2 = b / λ_rest2 = (b / λ_rest1) * (1 + v2/c) = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away, its λ_rest is longer (lower T), but according to this, T_rest2 is higher than T_rest1. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Wait, let me correct that.

If λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c), then since v2 is positive (moving away), (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1. So λ_rest2 is less than λ_rest1. Because λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / something > 1.

So, since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T, λ_rest2 < λ_rest1 implies T_rest2 > T_rest1.

So T_rest2 = (1 + v2/c) * T_rest1.

Ah, right. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed λ is longer. But the rest λ is shorter than the observed λ. So T_rest2 is higher than T_rest1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if a star is moving away, the observed λ is longer, which implies that the star's rest λ is shorter (higher temperature) than what we observe.

So, in this case, Star_2's rest temperature is higher than Star_1's rest temperature.

Wait, but wait, Star_1's observed λ is same as Star_2's observed λ.

So, if Star_2's rest λ is shorter, that means T_rest2 is higher.

So, T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, because λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c).

And since T_rest = b/λ_rest, T_rest2 = (b/λ_rest2) = (b/(λ_rest1/(1 + v2/c))) ) = (1 + v2/c) * (b/λ_rest1) ) = (1 + v2/c) * T_rest1.

So T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c).

So, T_rest2 is higher than T_rest1.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because when the source is moving away, the observed λ is longer, so the source's rest λ must be shorter, so higher temperature.

So, Star_2 has a higher rest temperature than Star_1.

Wait, but Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed λ is the same as its rest λ.

So, to compute the luminosity of each star, we need to use their rest temperatures.

So L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T_rest1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T_rest2^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T_rest1^4 / T_rest2^4).

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c) = T_rest1 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

v2 is 700 km/s.

So 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So T_rest2 = T_rest1 * 1.002333.

So T_rest1 / T_rest2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So (T_rest1 / T_rest2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute (0.99767)^4.

0.99767^2 ≈ (approx 0.99535).

Then 0.99535^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.228, which is about 2.23.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So the key was that Star_2 has a higher rest temperature because it's moving away, which makes its observed λ the same as Star_1's. So when computing luminosity, which depends on rest temperature, Star_2 is hotter, but its radius is smaller.

Wait, let me write it all out again.

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T1)^4.

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4.

But T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So L2 = 4π R2^2 σ (T1 * 1.002333)^4.

So L1/L2 = [ (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ] * [ T1^4 / (T1^4 * (1.002333)^4 ) ]

Simplify: (1.5)^2 / (1.002333)^4.

Which is 2.25 / (1.002333)^4.

Wait wait, no, in the ratio L1/L2, it's (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

So since T2 = T1 * 1.002333, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1.002333)^4.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1.002333)^4 ) ) = 2.25 * (approx 0.9907) ≈ 2.228.

So about 2.23, which matches option D.

Ah, so I had it the other way around earlier. Because T_rest2 is higher, T_rest1 is actually lower than T_rest2. So when calculating, the luminosity ratio ends up being less than 2.25.

So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radii**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\).
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, implying their observed peak wavelengths are identical. However, due to the Doppler effect, the rest wavelengths differ.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of \(v_1 = 0\), and Star_2 has \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\).

### Step 1: Relating Rest Temperatures
The observed wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is related to the rest wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{rest}}\) by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_1 = 0\)), \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2 (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

The rest wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\)), so:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + v_2/c
\]

Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute the radii and temperatures into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

1. \(\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5\), so \(\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25\).
2. \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}\), so:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

First, calculate \((1.002333)^4\). Using the approximation \((1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) = 1.009332
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.009332} \approx 0.9907
\]

Now, combine the terms:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times greater than that of Star_2.
