Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this science question about a ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question describes a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. So the vector has two open reading frames (ORFs): one for the ligand and one for the receptor.

The ligand is placed at the 5' position and is fused to mCherry. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' and fused to mCherry? Or is mCherry a separate thing? Oh, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor is at the 3' position and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So ligand comes first, then the receptor.

But wait, there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, I think these are stop cassettes which prevent expression unless the lox sites are recombined.

So the setup is probably for Cre to excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor. Because the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, maybe for expression in various tissues.

They made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells and some other cell lineages. Cre is used to delete specific sequences, like the stop cassettes here.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal using fluorescent microscopy. They expected a green signal, but didn't see any. What's wrong?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means acting on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the cells. If the ligand and receptor are produced by same cells, autocrine, but if not, then paracrine. But the problem is about expression, not cell signaling. So maybe not directly relevant.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor didn't traffic properly, eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, so wouldn't fluoresce. But why wouldn't it express in the first place? The Western blot showed no eGFP? Or maybe the construct isn't being expressed.

Wait, the Western blot used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. So they transfected primary astrocytes and saw signals proportional to actin. Did they see eGFP and mCherry? Or not? The question says they used the antibodies to test construct expression. But the result of that isn't given directly. So perhaps the expression in the transfection worked, but in the mouse model, it's not expressing.

Wait, the question says that in the mouse model, after birth, they don't see green. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Option C: The enhancer is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so probably doesn't need enhancer. So maybe the issue isn't the enhancer. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. The first ORF is ligand with mCherry, but I think that's a fusion. Wait, the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP at C-terminus. So the eGFP is a separate tag. But the stop cassettes are between them.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. So when Cre is introduced, which site is cut? Cre recognizes loxP sites. Wait, the lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also recognize but only in a certain way, perhaps. Or maybe, the construct has two different stop cassettes that require Cre to remove both.

Wait, the setup is that the ligand is first (5') with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after it. Then comes the receptor with lox2272-stop-lox2272. So to express both, Cre must excise both stops.

But when they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic line where SOX10 is expressed under a promoter that drives Cre expression. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre is active there. So the Cre would recombine the lox sites, deleting the stop cassettes.

Wait, but the loxP sites— the ligand's stop cassette is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's by lox2272. I remember that Cre can recognize lox2272, but perhaps only when it's in a certain configuration. Or maybe the problem is that the lox2272 isn't compatible with the same Cre.

Wait, no, I think the lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre, but only when paired with another lox2272. Because loxP and lox2272 are different. So in the vector, the ligand's stop cassette is between loxP sites, and the receptor's is between lox2272 sites.

So when Cre is introduced, which is from SOX10-Cre, which is a loxP-dependent Cre, it would only recombine the loxP sites, not the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the ligand's stop would be excised, allowing ligand expression. But the receptor's stop cassette, being flanked by lox2272, wouldn't be cut by Cre. So the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but that can't be— because the vector design must have both stops excised for both proteins to be expressed. If only one stop is excised, then one gene is expressed and the other not.

So in this case, the ligand would be expressed (since loxP is cut), but the receptor's stop remains, so it's not expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

But why would the mouse model not express the receptor? Because the Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which only targets loxP sites, not lox2272. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

Wait, but the construct is homozygous. So each allele has the same setup. So in each allele, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap. The vector is bicistronic, with ligand and receptor. Each is in a separate ORF. The ligand is first, with a stop cassette that's loxP-flanked. The receptor is second, with a stop cassette flanked by lox2272.

In the Cre model, SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells. Cre would cut the loxP sites in the ligand's stop cassette, allowing the ligand to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre (loxP-based) can't cut. So the receptor's ORF remains under the stop cassette, so it isn't expressed.

Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still there. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, the tags are separate. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the stop is between them. So if the stop isn't excised, the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

So why isn't the stop excised? Because the Cre isn't able to recombine the lox2272 sites. The Cre is only targeting loxP. So the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't. So the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP signal.

So in the options, which one aligns with this?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no. The issue is that the stop isn’t excised, not a frame problem. So maybe the mistake is that the stop isn’t excised because the correct lox sites aren’t being cut.

Looking back at the options, which one matches. The correct answer should relate to the lox sites not being correctly cut.

Looking at the options, option D is about being out of frame, which is a cloning issue. The other options don't directly address the expression of the receptor. Option C is about enhancer, which isn't the case here because the CBA is a strong promoter.

Wait, option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, not enhancer. The receptor is under IRES. Maybe the IRES isn't working? But IRES is a regulatory element that allows internal ribosome entry; I'm not sure if they require enhancers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the Cre can’t recombine the lox2272 sites, so the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the options don't directly state that.

Looking again, the possible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed because the Cre isn't present in the right cells.

Wait, wait: the Cre is under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes. So if the construct is in the neural crest cells, the Cre should be active there. So the construct is designed to have both stop cassettes, but only the loxP ones are cut by the Cre. So the ligand is expressed (since its stop is gone), but the receptor's stop isn't cut. Thus, the receptor isn't expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed in the cells where SOX10-Cre is active. So when they look for green under confocal, they see nothing because the eGFP isn't expressed.

So which option relates to the stop not being excised? Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the ORF is disrupted, leading to a frame shift. But that's a cloning issue, which would prevent expression regardless of Cre.

But the issue here is that the stop isn't cut, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the problem isn't in the cloning (assuming the construct was correctly made), but in the Cre not cutting the lox2272 sites. But the options don't directly address that.

Wait, the question says the vector is homozygous. So perhaps when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous, only the loxP sites are recombined because the Cre can't target lox2272. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

So in the Western blot after transfection, they saw expression? The question says after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, they tested the expression via Western blot with antibodies. But in the mouse model, the expression isn't happening. So perhaps the mouse model's Cre is not active in the cells where the construct is expressed, or the construct isn't being excised correctly.

Alternatively, the construct's expression is dependent on the Cre being active and the correct lox sites.

Wait, perhaps the vector has both the ligand and receptor under the same promoter, but in reality, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So CBA is a strong promoter for the ligand, which is first, and the receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for internal initiation.

But in the presence of a stop, the IRES might not work. So if the stop cassette is present, the receptor isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, without Cre excising the stop, the receptor isn't expressed.

So the reason the eGFP isn't expressed is that the stop isn't cut, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, the problem is that the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites. But looking at the options, none mention this directly.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassettes are using different lox sites, so the Cre can't cut both. So the ligand is expressed (because its stop is cut), but the receptor isn't.

So why didn't the confocal show green? Because the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct where the two ORFs are ligand and receptor, each with their own stop cassettes. The ligand has loxP, and the receptor has lox2272. The Cre from SOX10-Cre can only cut loxP, not lox2272. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand expression, but the receptor's stop remains, preventing its expression. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the construct works for the ligand, but not the receptor. Since the question is about why the green (eGFP) isn't seen, it's because the receptor's stop isn't cut.

So looking at the options, the only one that might relate is D if the stop remains, which prevents the receptor from being expressed, meaning the eGFP isn't made. So why is the stop not cut?

Because the lox sites are different. The Cre can't cut lox2272, so the stop remains.

So in the options, the correct reason is that the Cre isn't able to excise the receptor's stop because it's a different lox site. But the options don't have that as an option. Let me check all options again.

Option A: Paracrine relationship. Doesn't explain lack of expression. Unrelated.

Option B: Receptor stuck in Golgi. Maybe, but why would it be stuck? The problem is about expression, not trafficking.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The CBA is a promoter, so no enhancer needed. Unlikely.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the frame is wrong, the protein wouldn't be made, but this is a cloning issue. However, the question says the construct was designed correctly. So why isn't the stop being cut?

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassettes are in the opposite orientation, so Cre can't cut. Or perhaps because the IRES isn't working. Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. Oh, wait, the question says: the ligand is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the receptor is under the control of an IRES, which is a weaker promoter. So if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed even if the stop is cut.

Wait, but the stop is still in place unless the Cre excises it. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed even if the stop is gone. So that could be a possibility.

Wait, but in the question, the vector design is bicistronic, with ligand under CBA and receptor under IRES. So the ligand is first, then the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so the ligand would be expressed regardless of the IRES. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed from the same transcript, but in a different frame.

Wait, no. Wait, bicistronic vectors use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or 2A peptide sequences to allow two proteins to be expressed from a single transcript. So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the mRNA, which includes both ORFs. The first ORF is the ligand, followed by the IRES, then the receptor.

Wait, no, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP. So the order is: ligand (5') with stop, then IRES, then receptor (3'), with its own stop.

Wait, I think the construct is: [Ligand ORF] [Stop cassette (loxP)] [IRES] [Receptor ORF] [Stop cassette (lox2272)].

So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the entire mRNA, which includes the ligand ORF, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF would be translated, but the stop cassette would prevent the receptor from being expressed. But when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop cassette, allowing the IRES to function and the receptor ORF to be translated.

But wait, wait: the IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So the mRNA is ligand ORF followed by IRES followed by receptor ORF.

In the absence of Cre, the stop cassette after ligand prevents the receptor from being expressed. Cre cuts the loxP sites, allowing the ligand's ORF to be expressed, and the IRES allows the receptor ORF to be translated.

But if the stop cassette after the receptor is lox2272, which isn't cut by Cre, then the receptor's expression is prevented. So even after Cre cuts the ligand's stop, the receptor remains under the stop cassette.

Wait, but the IRES is after the ligand's stop. So when the stop cassette is cut, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the vector structure. Let me try to outline the construct:

The vector is a bicistronic construct with two ORFs: ligand and receptor.

Structure:

Promoter (CBA) -> Ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> IRES -> Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so perhaps the ligand's ORF is followed by mCherry, but the stop is in between. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the question says: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop cassette. So after ligand, there's a stop that can be removed by Cre.

Similarly, the receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP, with a stop cassette between them.

So the structure is:

Ligand ORF [Stop cassette (loxP) ] mCherry;

But wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh no, wait: the ligand ORF is at 5', and after it is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed only when the stop is excised. Then comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF, which has its own stop cassette (lox2272).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the vector as:

5' [CBA promoter] --> [Ligand ORF] --> [loxP-stop-loxP] --> [IRES] --> [Receptor ORF] --> [lox2272-stop-lox2272] --> [eGFP] 3'

So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes block the downstream ORFs.

When Cre is present, it cuts the loxP sites and the lox2272 sites. Wait, can Cre cut lox2272? Or does it only cut loxP?

I remember that loxP and lox2272 are different; lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre to cut in a way that leads to inversion if both are present. But in this case, each stop cassette is flanked by same type of lox sites.

So, in the construct, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop by lox2272.

SOX10-Cre is a Cre line that can only cut loxP sites in the construct. So when Cre is introduced, it would cut the loxP sites, removing the ligand's stop. But the receptor's stop remains because the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre.

Therefore, the ligand is expressed (allowing mCherry to be expressed), but the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the receptor's ORF is blocked by the stop cassette, which isn't cut because Cre can't target lox2272.

Looking back at the options, the only one that fits is that the stop isn't removed for the receptor, so it isn't expressed. But the options don't directly state this. So which option is correct?

Wait, the options are:

A) paracrine.

B) stuck in Golgi.

C) missing enhancer.

D) not in frame.

Hmm, D is about the frame. If the stop isn't cut, the ORF isn't expressed. So perhaps the problem is that the stop isn't excised, which is related to the lox2272 not being cut.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't functional, but that's option C (enhancer missing), which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the construct is designed so that only the ligand is expressed, and the receptor isn't. Because the stop cassette for the receptor isn't cut. Therefore, the eGFP doesn't get expressed.

But why is this happening? Because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the issue is that the lox sites are different, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the vector isn't set up correctly. If the stop cassettes are using the same lox sites, then Cre would cut both. But if they're different, only some are cut.

In this case, the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. Hence, no eGFP.

But looking at the options, the only one that would explain why the receptor isn't expressed is D: the eGFP isn't in frame because the stop isn't cut. Wait, no, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem in the construct, but the real issue is the stop isn't cut.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is with the IRES not allowing the receptor to be expressed, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot in the question shows that the receptor isn't being expressed. But the user didn't say the blot result.

Wait, but the question says that the user made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre, so the offspring should have Cre activity in neural crest-derived cells.

Without the Cre, the stops are present, so ligand and receptor aren't expressed. With Cre, the ligand's stop is cut, so ligand is expressed, but the receptor's stop remains.

But why would the Western blot show anything? Because in the transfection, they used primary astrocytes. If the vector is transfected into astrocytes, which perhaps don't have Cre, then the stops are present. So in the transfected cells, the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the question says the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins and used in the Western blot to test construct expression. Hmm, perhaps the construct wasn't properly expressed, leading them to design the antibodies.

But regardless, the main issue is why the mouse model doesn't express eGFP.

So the most likely reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being cut by Cre, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the options don't have that as a choice.

Wait, looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If during cloning, the receptor ORF and eGFP are not in frame, then the entire receptor-eGFP fusion would not be expressed. But that's a different issue.

Wait, but in the construct, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the stop is still present, the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either. So the issue is that the stop isn't being cut, not a frame issue.

But the options don't address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the wrong orientation. For example, the loxP sites are in a way that Cre can't cut them. But again, not in the options.

So, the only option that could explain the lack of eGFP expression is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't functional, but that's not in the options.

Wait, another angle: the ligand and receptor might be in a paracrine relationship. So ligand is produced by one cell, receptor by another. But in the mouse model, perhaps the ligand is expressed in a different cell type than the receptor-expressing cells, leading to no green signal. But the question says they're expressed in neural crest cells, so same cells, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the ligand is expressed, but without the receptor, no signaling, but the question is about expression, not function.

Wait, but the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the receptor isn't being expressed. The only reason for that is that the stop cassette isn't being cut, so the ORF isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that seems unrelated.

Wait, another possibility: the lox2272 cassette is using a different Cre variant. So perhaps only loxP is cut by the SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre. But the lox2272 requires another type of Cre, perhaps. So the stop isn't cut, leading to the receptor not being expressed.

But again, the options don't have this.

So, given the options and the reasoning, I think the best fit is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to co-express a ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. The ligand is placed at the 5' position under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette upstream. The receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream. The vector is introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, which is then crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre expression in neural crest-derived cells. Despite this, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of the receptor and eGFP, not the functional interaction between ligand and receptor. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would prevent proper trafficking to the cell surface, but this would not explain why the receptor is not expressed in the first place. The issue lies in the expression of the receptor, not its trafficking.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter that does not require an enhancer. The receptor is under the control of an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry for translation. The absence of an enhancer is unlikely to be the cause of the problem.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, the receptor-eGFP fusion protein would not be expressed. However, the question does not provide evidence of a cloning error or frame shift in the construct. The issue is more likely related to the failure of the stop cassette flanking the receptor to be excised, preventing receptor expression.

### Conclusion:
The lack of eGFP expression is due to the failure of the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream of the receptor to be excised by Cre. SOX10-Cre can only recognize and excise loxP sites, not lox2272 sites, leaving the receptor's stop cassette intact and preventing its expression. While none of the options explicitly address this issue, the most plausible explanation among the given options is **Option D**, as it indirectly relates to the failure of the receptor to be expressed, even though the reasoning does not fully align with the described vector design.

Answer: D
