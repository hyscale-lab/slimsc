Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is the correct formula based on the information provided from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Alright, let's start by breaking down each technique and what it tells us.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, is it an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? Because I think carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch due to the hydrogen bonding. Alcohols also have a broad peak, but maybe not as broad as carboxylic acids? Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's keep that in mind.

Also, the FTIR shows two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are important. The 1700 cm⁻¹ region is typically where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids) absorb. The 1650 cm⁻¹ is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ring (C=C) or perhaps another carbonyl group. Wait, but if the 1700 is a carbonyl, what about the 1650? Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or an acid. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring's absorption. Aromatic C=C stretching is around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹, but I think it can vary. Alternatively, it might be an acid's carbonyl if it's conjugated with something else.

Wait, but if there's an O-H stretch (like a broad peak), and also a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have both O-H and a carbonyl. Or maybe an ester? Wait, esters have a carbonyl, but do they have O-H? No, esters are O-H-free. So if there's a broad O-H, it's more likely a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring. Let me think. Suppose the compound has a benzene ring, which would show up as a peak around 1600 cm⁻¹. But the peak here is at 1650, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the absorption to shift up.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says several peaks were observed, including those corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's a double bond somewhere. For example, maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Looking at the Mass Spectrometry part: there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what could that correspond to? The molecular ion breaks down into fragments, and this fragment has a mass of 45. Common fragments include things like (CH3)2CO (which is acetone, m/z 58?), wait no. Or maybe CH3CO+ which is 43. Hmm, maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group or something similar.

Wait, 45 is a familiar mass. Let me think. 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is (3*1 + 2*16) = 3 +32=35? No, that's 35. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)CO, which would be 43 (12*2 + 1*3 +16 = 24+3+16=43). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2O fragment. CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. Not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of the options, so perhaps the molecular weight can be calculated. Let me compute the molecular weights:

Option A: C6H12O2. Carbon is 12*6=72, H12 is 12, O2 is 32. Total is 72+12+32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12=72, 10H=10, O=16. Total 98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum's fragment is 45. If the molecular formula is, say, C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment is 45, that leaves 114-45=69. Maybe the parent ion breaks into something like 45 and 69. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion peak in mass spec is usually around the molecular weight. But if the molecular weight is 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), or 100 (D). The fragment at 45 could be a common fragment like (CH3)2CO, but that's 58. Alternatively, maybe an ethyl group or something else. Hmm, perhaps the fragment is a ketone group or an ester group.

Wait, let me think about the possible functional groups based on IR. The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, likely. 1650 could be an aromatic ring (if it's around 1600 for benzene, maybe a conjugated carbonyl). Alternatively, it could be a conjugated double bond.

But considering the O-H from the IR, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch, and a carbonyl around 1700. But wait, the two peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's an acid derivative, but with another functional group.

Now, let's think about the possible structures of the options. For example, C6H12O2 might be something like methyl cyclopentane with a hydroxyl group? Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with some functional groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, another approach: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests either an alkene or an aromatic ring. So, the compound might have a benzene ring or an alkene.

Now, considering the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could include an ester, such as methyl cyclopentanoate, or maybe a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group or something. Alternatively, a benzene ring with an ester substituent.

Option B: C6H10O. This could be something like cyclohexanol (but that would be C6H12O). Wait, C6H10O would have a double bond. Maybe it's an allyl alcohol, or perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. This might be something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate, or a benzaldehyde derivative with an ester or something. Alternatively, a di-substituted aromatic compound with two oxygen-containing groups.

Option D: C6H12O. Could be cyclohexanol, but that would have a higher H count. But if it's an alcohol with a double bond, maybe like cyclohexene methanol or something similar.

Wait, another thought: the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR. If the compound has an aromatic ring, the vinyl hydrogens would be the protons on the benzene ring. So, perhaps the compound is an aromatic compound with substituents.

Let me think about how the IR would look for an aromatic ring. Benzene itself doesn't show a peak around 1650; it's more around 1450-1600. If the substituent is strong, like an electron-withdrawing group, it can cause the ring's absorption to shift up. For example, a nitro group or a carbonyl group.

So, if the IR shows a peak at 1650, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl group. Like a ketone on the ring (like acetophenone), but that would have a carbonyl around 1700 and the ring around 1650. Alternatively, a nitro group on the ring could cause the ring absorption to be higher.

But wait, the 1700 peak is also present. So that's another carbonyl group. So maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl substituent. For example, benzaldehyde would have a carbonyl at 1700, and the ring absorption around 1600. But perhaps in some cases, it can be a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester. For example, methyl benzoate would have two carbonyl groups: the ester carbonyl and maybe the aromatic ring.

Wait, methyl benzoate's structure is OMe-O-C6H5. The ester carbonyl would be around 1700, and the aromatic ring would have peaks around 1600. But perhaps in this case, the substituent's effect shifts the ring's peak a bit higher, to 1650.

Now, let's go back to the options. Let me take each option one by one and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. So maybe a benzene ring with some substituents.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10 -2*16*? Wait, no. Wait, formula is C6H10O2. So (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, like a benzene ring with an ester group. Or an ester group with a double bond elsewhere.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree: a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond or an aromatic ring. So, depending on the structure, some options might not fit.

Now, considering FTIR: broad peak at 3000 (O-H), 1700 (carbonyl), and 1650 (maybe ring or conjugated carbonyl).

If the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl, it could be an ester if there's an O-H somewhere else. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid would have O-H and a carbonyl. So, but then the 1650 might be the ring.

Let me think about a benzoic acid derivative. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but the options here are C6. So maybe a substituted benzoic acid with one less carbon? Or perhaps a different structure.

Wait, the molecular formula options: all are C6. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents.

For example, if it's a benzene ring with a methoxy group and a carbonyl group. But that's more into the realm of esters.

Wait, another approach: looking at the mass spec fragment of m/z=45. What's the possible fragment? 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO, but that's not a common one. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group or something else.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular weight of (CH3)CO+ which would be 43 (12+3*1 + 16= 12+3+16=31? Wait, no, 12*2 (for C2) is 24, H3 is 3, O is 16. 24+3+16=43. So 43. So 45 is a bit higher than that.

Alternatively, maybe it's the mass of a fragment like CH2CH2OCH3? No, that's more than 45. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH2O group, which is 44 (12*2 +4 + 16=24+4+16=44). Wait, 44. So 45 is 44 plus 1, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C3H7O, but that would be 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. Not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone fragment. For example, if there's a (CH3)2CO group, that's 58, as I thought earlier. So 58 is higher than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O fragment. Formaldehyde is 30. Hmm, not 45. Or maybe a CH2CHO group. Not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be a (CH2)2O group? That would be (2*12) + (4) +16=24+4+16=44. No, that's 44.

Wait, what about HCOOCH3 (methyl formate)? The molecular weight is 60 (12+16*2 +12 +1*3= 12+32+12+3=60). So a fragment might be part of that. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Another approach: the molecular formula of the compound. Let's take each option and see what structures are possible.

Option A: C6H12O2. The formula would have a degree of unsaturation of 1. So possible structures: a benzene ring (3 degrees) but that's not possible here since 1 degree. Wait, wait, wait. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C6H12O2, that's (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is three degrees, but in this case, the compound can't have a ring because 1 degree is not enough). So this suggests a double bond or a ring. But wait, benzene is three, so perhaps it's a cyclopropane with some substituents, but that's unusual.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester. For example, methyl cyclopentanoate would have the formula C6H10O2. Wait, wait, methyl cyclopentanoate is C6H10O2? Let me count: cyclopentanoic acid is C5H8O2. Wait, no, cyclopentanoic acid is C5H10O2. Its ester would be C6H10O2 when esterified with methanol. So, C5H9O2 (acid) + CH3OH → C6H10O2 (ester) + H2O. So, yes, methyl cyclopentanoate is C6H10O2, which would match option C.

Wait, but option A is C6H12O2. Let's think about that. If it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that's less likely. Or perhaps a substituted ester with more hydrogens. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45—maybe it's the CH3O group (31) plus something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible functional groups. If the compound is an ester, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700. An ester group would have O-C-O, so maybe another peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the ester C-O. But the IR data given doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H. So I'm thinking, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. Let's see. A carboxylic acid would have O-H and a carbonyl. So, the IR would show O-H (broad) and carbonyl (around 1700). Then what about the 1650 peak? Maybe that's an aromatic ring. So, it's benzoic acid or a substituted benzoic acid.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The options are all C6, so perhaps it's a substituted benzoic acid, but that would require reducing the ring size, which isn't likely. Alternatively, the compound may not be a carboxylic acid but something with another O-H group, like a phenol.

Wait, phenol has a broad O-H stretch around 3000. The IR would also show the aromatic ring's C=C around 1600. But the given IR has a peak at 1650. Maybe it's an ortho-substituted phenol with a carbonyl group, which would cause the ring's absorption to shift up. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, as in a benzaldehyde group.

Wait, if the compound is benzaldehyde, the O-H would be absent. So the broad peak in IR can't be from an aldehyde. So perhaps it's a phenol with a carbonyl group, such as a substituted benzaldehyde, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an O-H group.

Wait, perhaps it's a salicylic acid derivative. Salicylic acid has a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group. Let me think about its structure. Yes, salicylic acid is 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. Its formula is C7H6O3, but the options don't have three oxygens. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a methyl salicylate, which is an ester. But methyl salicylate has two O's in the ester group, so the formula would be C8H8O3, which is not matching any options here.

Wait, let's think again about the options. Let's look at option C: C6H10O2. That would have a molecular weight of 114. So the mass spec's fragment of 45 would be a part of that.

If the compound is methyl cyclopentanoate (C6H10O2), then in the IR, the ester carbonyl would be around 1700. But would there be an O-H peak? No, because esters don't have O-H. So the broad peak in the IR suggests an O-H, which would not fit an ester. Therefore, maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted cyclohexene with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests either an aromatic ring or an alkene. Let's consider that.

If the compound is an aromatic compound (like benzene with substituents), then the NMR would show peaks for the aromatic protons. The IR would show the aromatic ring's C=C around 1600, but the given peak is at 1650, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the substituent is electron-withdrawing, causing the ring's stretching to increase in frequency.

So, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester or a substituted benzaldehyde.

Wait, but if it's an aromatic ester, such as phenyl acetate, but that's C8H8O2, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, the compound could be an aromatic ring with an ester group, but that would require more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with a ketone group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a benzene ring with two substituents. For example, a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group. But that would be similar to salicylic acid, which has three oxygens, not two.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with an ester group and an O-H group. But that's four oxygens, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me consider each option again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So perhaps a ring (3) wouldn't fit, but maybe a double bond and a ring? No, because degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C6H12O2: (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. So either a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

So, for the IR, if there's a broad O-H, and a carbonyl, and a peak at 1650, then perhaps the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent that causes the ring's C=C to be at higher wavenumber.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted cyclopentene with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, it would have a carbonyl peak around 1700. Also, if it's a di-substituted cyclohexene, the IR might show a peak for the double bond.

But wait, the IR doesn't show a peak for the double bond. Or does it? I thought that IR for alkenes is usually around 1650 cm⁻¹. So the 1650 peak in IR could be the alkene's C=C stretch. Then, the 1700 would be a carbonyl group. But then, where's the O-H?

Wait, if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H group, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require more oxygens.

Wait, wait, the FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 wavenumbers. That's probably O-H. So if the compound has an O-H and a carbonyl, but also a double bond (which would be the 1650 peak), then perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group and an O-H. For example, a phenol with a ketone substituent. But that would require more than six carbons if it's a benzene ring plus substituents.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an alcohol substituent. For example, something like phenyl acetone: but I'm not sure about the formula.

Wait, let's think of specific structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: maybe an ester with a cyclic structure, like methyl cyclopentanoate. Wait, methyl cyclopentanoate is C6H10O2, which is option C. So option A is C6H12O2. Hmm.

Another possibility for option A could be a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. Could be a diol, but that would have two O-H groups. But the IR shows a very broad peak, which might be consistent with a diol. Or perhaps a cyclic ether with an alcohol substituent.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond or aromatic protons. So if the compound is an aromatic ring (benzene), the NMR would show a set of aromatic peaks. But the options for the molecular formula are all C6, which would imply a benzene ring (C6H6), but the formulas have more H's, so substituents are present.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. If the compound is C6H10O2, that's four more H's. So perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, with each substituent adding H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not aromatic but has an alkene.

Wait, considering the mass spec fragment again. The m/z=45 could be a common fragment. Let me think about the possible structures and their fragments.

If the compound is a methyl ester, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester group breaking off. For example, methyl esters typically have a (CH3O) group which is 31. But 45 is higher than that.

Alternatively, if the compound is an aldehyde, the fragment could be CHO (29), but 45 is higher.

Another possibility: the fragment comes from a ketone. For example, if there's a (CH3)CO group, which would have a mass of 43. But 45 is two more than that. Maybe it's (CH3)COCH2- or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula options include O2, so perhaps the compound has an ester group. The ester group is O2. So if the compound is an ester, the structure would be R-O-C-O-R'. The ester carbonyl would be around 1700 cm⁻¹, which fits the IR data.

But then, why is there a broad O-H peak in the IR? Ester groups don't have O-H. So perhaps the O-H is from another group, like an alcohol.

Wait, but the options with O2 are A and C. Let's consider option C: C6H10O2. So perhaps it's an ester and an alcohol. No, because that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone). Lactones have one O. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ortho ester, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Another thought: the presence of a broad O-H suggests a strong hydrogen bond, like a carboxylic acid. So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the IR would have O-H and two carbonyls (but carboxylic acids have only one carbonyl). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, but the IR has two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring or another group.

Wait, perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. So the compound could be a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like benzaldehyde) and an O-H group, perhaps as a phenol. But benzaldehyde is C7H6O. The options are C6, so perhaps the substituents are different.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and an O-H group. For example, para-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But that would be C7H6O3, which isn't an option here.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the degrees of unsaturation. For example, option C (C6H10O2) has two degrees. So that could be a benzene ring (three degrees) plus something else? No, because that would exceed the two degrees. So perhaps it's a double bond and a ring, but that's three degrees. Wait, no, two degrees can be a ring and a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a cyclic ketone with an O-H group. For example, cyclopentanone with a hydroxyl group. The formula would be C5H8O2. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- FTIR: broad O-H (3000), carbonyl (1700), another peak at 1650 (possibly aromatic or conjugated carbonyl).

- 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens present → double bond or aromatic ring.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45.

The options are four possible formulas. The presence of O-H (from IR) and a carbonyl (ester or acid) suggests that the compound has both.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a cyclic ketal or acetal, but that usually doesn't have O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted cyclic ester with an alcohol group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzene ring with an ester substituent and an O-H group. But that might require more oxygens.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures for each option again.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's suppose it's a benzene ring with an ester group. So for example, something like methyl benzoate would be C8H8O2, which is not matching. So perhaps a smaller ring. Maybe a cyclopentyl ester. Wait, methyl cyclopentanoate is C6H10O2. Yes, that matches option C.

So, methyl cyclopentanoate would have the formula C6H10O2. Let me check: cyclopentanoic acid is C5H8O2. When esterified with methanol, it becomes C6H10O2 (since it's C5H8O2 + CH3OH → C6H10O2 + H2O). So yes, that's correct.

But wait, does methyl cyclopentanoate have an O-H group? No, because esters don't have O-H; they have O-R groups. So the FTIR's broad O-H peak wouldn't fit in this case. Therefore, option C might not be the correct answer.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, if the compound is an ester, why is there an O-H in the IR? That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diol ester, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, something like ethyl acetoacetate. But that's C5H8O3, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a coumarin derivative, but again, that's getting into more complex structures.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests either an aromatic ring or an alkene. So, if the compound is an aromatic ring with substituents, the NMR would have multiple peaks for the aromatic protons. Alternatively, if it's an alkene, the vinyl protons would be as a triplet or something similar.

But the FTIR shows a peak at 1650, which could be the C=C stretch of an alkene. So, if the compound has a double bond, that would fit the 1650 peak.

So, combining all this, perhaps the compound is an alkene with a carbonyl group and an O-H group.

Wait, but that would require O-H and two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and one O-H.

Wait, if the compound has a double bond, a carbonyl, and an O-H, then the molecular formula would have the appropriate oxygens.

Looking at the options, option A is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So that could be a ring or a double bond. If it's a double bond, then another group would require more degrees. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec fragment of 45. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas that would result in a fragment of 45. 45 is 9 + 36, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH2)3O (but that's 44). Or maybe (CH2)2OCH3 (which would be 44 +1=45? Not sure).

Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2OCH2 group or something. I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, (CH3)2CO is 58. No, that's higher than 45. Alternatively, CH3CO (43), but that's close. So, perhaps the fragment is CH3CO (43), and there's an additional H or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be C3H7O2. But 3*12 +7 +32=36+7+32=75. No, that's too high.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the possible structures again.

Another thought: the presence of an ester group would lead to a carbonyl peak around 1700. So, if the IR has a peak at 1700, that suggests an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid.

If it's an ester, then the O-H in the IR would have to come from somewhere else. But esters don't have O-H. So perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid with another functional group. But the options don't have any with three oxygens except maybe option C (C6H10O2, which has two oxygens).

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a cyclic ester (a lactone). Lactones have a ring structure with an ester functional group. So for example, gamma-butyrolactone. But gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, a cyclic ester derived from a six-carbon acid. So, for example, if it's a cyclohexenolactone, which would have a ring with an ester and an alcohol group. Then, the IR would show both the O-H (broad) and the ester carbonyl (1700). The 1650 peak could be the ring's C=C. But then, the molecular formula would have to fit.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a bicyclic ester with a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another angle.

The presence of a fragment at 45 in mass spec. Let me think about the possible structures that could lose a fragment of 45. So, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. So, losing a 45 fragment would leave 114-45=69. So a possible fragment of 45 and another of 69.

Wait, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO (acetone, 58? No, wait: 12*3 + 3*1 + 16=36+3+16=55. No, that's 55. Hmm. 45 is 12*2 + 1*5 +16=24+5+16=45. So C2H5O.

Wait, that could be a propyl group with an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)2CO group, which would be 43 (24 + 2 +16=42? No, 24+2=26 +16=42. So that's 42, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like CH2CH2OCH3, which would be 44 (24 +4 +16=44). Not 45.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me compute the possible combinations.

45 = 12a + 1b + 16c + 14d + 2e + 1f,

where a is C, b H, etc. Looking for a fragment that adds up to 45. Let's see:

Option 1: C3H7O → 3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59. No.

Option 2: C2H5O2 → 24 +5 +32=61. No.

Option3: C2H3O → 24+3+16=43. No.

Option4: C4H9O → 48 +9=57 +16=73. No.

Hmm, maybe it's a fragment without oxygen. Like C3H9. 3*12=36 +9=45. So, yes, C3H9 is 45. So the fragment could be a propane group with three carbons and nine hydrogens. But that's a lot of hydrogens. Wait, but maybe it's a different arrangement.

Wait, wait, molecular formula for a fragment m/z=45 could be C3H9 (3*12 +9=36+9=45). So maybe the fragment is a propyl group. But that doesn't explain much.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)2CH2 group (but that's C3H6, which is 42). Not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is C2H5CHO. So, 24 +5 +28=57. No, that's too high.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group (44) plus a hydrogen, making 45. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a (CH3)CO+ ion, which is 43. Then, maybe the actual fragment is 44 or 45. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion or something else. But I'm not clear on that.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If the compound has a benzene ring, then the NMR would show aromatic protons. The IR would show the ring's C=C around 1600, but here it's at 1650. So perhaps the substituent is causing the ring's absorption to shift up.

If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the ring's absorption could be at a higher wavenumber.

So, perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a carbonyl substituent (like benzaldehyde) and an O-H group. But that would require more than six carbons, so perhaps in this case, it's a substituted benzene with a carbonyl and an O-H group. But the formula options are all C6, so this might not fit.

Wait, maybe the compound is cyclohexanone with an O-H group. So, cyclohexanol with a ketone group. But the formula would be C6H10O2. Let me see: cyclohexanol is C6H12O, so adding a ketone would require another O. Wait, no, that's not possible.

Wait, another idea: if the compound is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group, but that would require 7 carbons (benzene is 6). So that's not possible with the given options.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a diketone. But that would require more oxygens.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So, maybe a double bond and a ring (which would be 4 degrees, so that's not possible). So, perhaps a single ring and no double bonds. But then, where do the vinyl hydrogens come from? So, perhaps this option is less likely.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation 2. Possible structures: an aromatic ring (which would be 4 degrees, so no). Alternatively, a double bond and a ring, but that's 3 degrees. So perhaps, a double bond and a carbonyl group. For example, a cyclic ketone with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. Could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So, perhaps a ring or a double bond. If it's a double bond, then the IR would show a peak around 1650.

Putting it all together, the IR has a broad O-H (so possible alcohol or acid), a carbonyl (1700), and another peak (1650) possibly from an aromatic ring or double bond.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so either an alkene or aromatic ring.

The mass spec fragment is 45, which I can't figure out, but perhaps it's a propyl group.

Another thought: perhaps the compound is a cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group. For example, cyclopentanone with a hydroxyl group. But the formula would be C5H8O2, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. So, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, maybe an ester attached to a cyclohexene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group, making it C6H10O2.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, let me think of the possible structures for each option again.

Option A: C6H12O2. A possible structure could be a diol ester, but that's speculative.

Option B: C6H10O. Maybe an allyl alcohol: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2OH. But that's C6H10O.

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. Maybe a diol, but that would have two O-H groups, which would show a very broad peak in IR. But the IR only shows a broad peak, which could fit.

Wait, the IR shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, which could be from an O-H group. If the compound is an alcohol, that would fit. The 1700 peak suggests a carbonyl, which would not fit an alcohol. So perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid, which has an O-H and a carbonyl.

So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. Let's see:

For a six-carbon carboxylic acid: n=6. H would be 2*6=12. But wait, the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, the FTIR shows two peaks at 1700 and 1650. A carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700. And the 1650 could be from another group, like an aromatic ring or a conjugated carbonyl.

So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with another group, like a double bond, that might explain the peaks.

So, the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A), which fits the carboxylic acid.

But what structure can C6H12O2 have? It would be a six-carbon carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid. But hexanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is C6H12O2. The FTIR would show the O-H (broad) and the carbonyl (around 1700). But where would the 1650 peak come from? Maybe it's a conjugated double bond elsewhere, but hexanoic acid doesn't have a double bond.

Ah, perhaps the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, pent-4-enoic acid. Its structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The formula would be C6H10O2. But wait, that's option C.

Wait, but the given options are:

A) C6H12O2 → hexanoic acid (no double bond)

C) C6H10O2 → which would have a double bond (since it has two degrees of unsaturation)

So, if the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2 (no double bond). So, that's option A. How does that fit with the IR peaks?

The FTIR of hexanoic acid would have O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (~1700). But the other peak at 1650 would be from a double bond elsewhere. So, if the acid has a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C).

Ah, so perhaps the compound is a substituted acrylic acid, like pent-2-enoic acid. Its structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH (C3H4O2). So, a six-carbon version would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, which is C6H10O2. So yes, that's option C.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (broad), carbonyl (1700), and the double bond (maybe around 1650). That fits.

The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (the CH2=CH group), which is consistent.

The mass spec would show a fragment of 45. Let's see, the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment is 45, the parent ion would break into two parts: 45 and 69. What would cause a 45 fragment? Perhaps the CH2=CHCOOH group. The fragment could be CH2=CHCOO, which would have a mass of 59 (12*3 +2 +16*2=36+2+64=102? No, wait: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, which is 3*12=36 +3=39 +32=68. No, that's 77. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the CH2=CH- group. The fragment for CH2=CH would have a mass of 28 (24 +4=28). No, that's 28, not 45.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the COOH group. The COOH would fragment into COO-, which is 44 (12*2 +16*2=24+32=56? No, wait, COOH is 12 +16*2 +1= 12 +32 +1=45. Oh! Wait, COOH is -COOH, which is C=O-OH. So the group would have a molecular weight of 45 (12 +16*2 +1=45). Oh! So the fragment at 45 could be the COOH group breaking off as a fragment.

So, if the compound is a six-carbon unsaturated carboxylic acid (like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH), the COOH group (mass 45) could be a fragment in the mass spec.

That makes sense now.

So, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹, suggesting a carbonyl group and possibly a conjugated system or aromatic ring. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, consistent with a double bond or aromatic protons. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which could correspond to a common fragment such as the COOH group.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
   This formula corresponds to a saturated compound with one degree of unsaturation. A likely structure is hexanoic acid, which has an O-H group and a carbonyl group. However, the IR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ cannot be explained by this structure, as it lacks a double bond or aromatic system. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, likely corresponding to a double bond and one ring or another double bond. However, it lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group observed in the IR spectrum. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the data.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring or two double bonds. A plausible structure is a six-carbon unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂COOH. This structure explains the broad O-H peak (carboxylic acid), the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum likely corresponds to the COOH group breaking off as a fragment. This option fits all the data.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   This formula has one degree of unsaturation, likely corresponding to a ring or a double bond. However, it lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group observed in the IR spectrum. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it explains the broad O-H peak, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum.
