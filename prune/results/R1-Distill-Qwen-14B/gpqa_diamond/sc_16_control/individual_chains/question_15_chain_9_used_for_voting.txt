Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and figuring out which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

So, the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. They have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The stars are interesting. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But despite that, both stars have the same radius. Oh, right, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a bit larger, but in this case, their radii are the same. That's important because the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like (R_star / a_orbital)^2, but wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. I think the transit probability is actually higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. More specifically, the probability P is (R_star / a)^2 * (something else?), but I might be mixing it up with other factors.

Wait, no, I think the probability that a planet transits is actually (R_star / a) multiplied by some function, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me recall. The transit probability formula is (R*/a)^2, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is (R* + R_p) / a, but since the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, R_p is negligible, so it's approximately (R* / a). But wait, that would be the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star from our perspective. Or is it the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star?

Wait, here's the thing: the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star / a) * (something else). Oh, right! The transit probability, P, is (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator is just a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as (R_star / a). So P ≈ (R* / a).

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: The transit probability is actually (R*/a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is correct. Oh, right! The transit occurs only if the inclination is just right for the planet to pass in front of the star from our point of view. The probability of that happening is (R_star / a) * (something), but I think it's more accurate to say that the geometric probability is (R*/a), because that's the ratio of the star's size to the distance, so the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight.

Wait, not quite. Because as the planet orbits, the path it can take in front of the star is a circle with radius equal to the star's radius. So the area where the planet can pass in front is a circle of radius R* around the star. The total possible area for the planet's orbital plane is a circle with radius a (the semi-major axis). So the probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's possible orbital disk. So that would be (π R*²)/(π a²) ) = (R*/a)^2. Oh wait, that's different from before. So the probability is (R*/a)^2, not (R*/a). Because it's the ratio of areas.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. I need to clarify this. So, when considering the probability that a planet transits, it's the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The way this is calculated is based on the relative size of the star's disk compared to the planet's orbit.

The formula I remember is that the probability P is approximately (R*/a)^2. Because the cross-sectional area of the star is π R*², and the cross-sectional area of the orbit (the area where the planet can be in front) is π a². So the probability would be (R* / a)^2. Because only when the planet's orbital distance is within R* (from the center) in the plane of the sky would it transit.

Wait, that makes sense. So if R* is small compared to a, the probability is low. So to maximize the probability, you want R* to be as large as possible and a to be as small as possible.

But in this problem, both stars have the same radius, R*. So R* is the same for both stars. So the only variable is a, the semi-major axis. So the probability P is proportional to (1/a)^2. Because P = (R*)² / a², and R* is same for both, P ∝ 1/a².

So now, the question is: which planet has a smaller a? Because a smaller a would lead to a higher P.

Wait, but wait. The planets have orbital periods, and using Kepler's third law, we can relate the period to a. The period P is related to a and the mass of the star. Kepler's third law says P² = (4π² G M*)^(-1) a³. So P² is proportional to a³/(M*), assuming M* is the mass of the star.

Wait, more accurately, Kepler's third law in the form P² = (4π² G M*)^(-1) a³, but when M* is the mass of the star. So for a planet orbiting a star of mass M*, the period squared is proportional to a³ divided by M*.

So, given that, we can write P² proportional to a³ / M*.

We have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Let's note:

For Planet_1: P1 = P, M1 = 2 M2 (since the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host) Wait, no: the host of Planet_1 has mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The host of Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host of Planet_2. So M1 = 2 * M2. Because Planet_1's host is more massive.

So the period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, no. The problem states: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has period P/3.

So P1 = P2 /3.

We can express a in terms of P and M* using Kepler's third law.

So for each planet:

P² = (4π² G M*)^(-1) a³.

So a³ = (G M* P²) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M* P²)^(1/3).

So for each planet:

a1 = [ G M1 (P1)^2 ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3)

a2 = [ G M2 (P2)^2 ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3)

But since a depends only on M* and P, and the constants are the same for both, let's just consider the proportional relation.

So a1 proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3)

Similarly, a2 proportional to (M2 * P2²)^(1/3)

We know that M1 = 2 M2

P1 = (1/3) P2

So plugging in these:

a1 ∝ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )² )^(1/3)

= (2 M2) * ( P2² / 9 ) )^(1/3)

Which simplifies to (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ ( M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (2/9)^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( M2 P2² )^... divided by ( M2 P2² )^(1/3 ) ].

Wait, more accurately, since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3 )

And a2 is (M2 P2²)^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Wait, let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). Let me think: 9 is 3². 2/9 = 2/(3^2) = 2 * 3^(-2).

So (2/9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (3^(2/3)).

Which is approximately ... Well, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, and 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Because a1 is smaller, when you compute the transit probability, which is proportional to (R*/a)^2, and since R* is same for both, the probability is proportional to 1/(a)^2.

So P1 is proportional to (R* / a1 )^2 = (R* / (0.606 a2))^2 = (1 / 0.606 )² * (R*/a2 )^2.

Which is (approx 1.65 )² ≈ 2.72 times P2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because P is proportional to (R* / a)^2.

So P1/P2 = ( (R*/a1)^2 ) / ( (R*/a2)^2 ) ) = (a2/a1 )^2.

Because ( R* is same, so it cancels out.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 = approx 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times P2.

Wait, that can't be right because that would suggest Planet_1 has a much higher probability than Planet_2, but Planet_1 is closer and a higher mass star might have some effect on the transit probability.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

We have:

a1 = ( M1 * P1² )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

Given:

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 / 3

So substituting:

a1 = (2 M2 * (P2² / 9) )^(1/3 )

= [ (2 M2 P2² ) / 9 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 ) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3 ) = (2)^(1/3) / (3^(2/3)) )

Which is equal to (2/3^2)^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3).

So a1 is (2^(1/3) )/(3^(2/3)) ) times a2.

Which is approximately, as before, about 0.606 times a2.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, wait. a1 is 0.606 times a2, so a2 is larger than a1.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2.

Since R* is the same for both, the probability P is proportional to 1/a².

So P1 = (R* / a1 )²

P2 = (R* / a2 )²

So P1/P2 = (a2²)/(a1²) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a2 = a1 / 0.606, a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that would mean Planet_1 has a much higher probability, so the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1. But looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to about 2.7 times higher probability.

Option C says 1.65 times.

Wait, but wait, no. Because I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because the transit probability is (R*/a)^2. So for Planet_1, a is smaller, so (R*/a1) is bigger, hence (R*/a1)^2 is bigger. So Planet_1's transit probability is higher.

But according to the calculation, it's about 2.7 times higher.

So the correct choice would be D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 has 2.7 times higher.

Option A says Planet_2 is preferred with 2.25 times higher.

Option B: Planet_2 with 1.5 times.

Option C: Planet_1 with 1.65.

Hmm. So according to the calculation, the answer should be D.

But wait, I think I might have made an error in the formula earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I got the transit probability wrong. Maybe it's not (R* / a)^2, but (R* / a) instead.

Wait, the geometric probability is the area of the star's disk compared to the area of the planet's orbital path. The area of the star's disk is π R*². The area of the orbital path (the circle the planet can transit in) is π a². So the probability is (R*² / a² ) = (R*/a)^2.

So that part is correct.

So going back: the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R* / a1 )^2, and for Planet_2, (R*/a2 )^2.

So the ratio is (a2/a1 )^2.

So in numbers, a2 = a1 / 0.606.

So a2/a1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1 )^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is approximately 2.72 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, which is option D.

But let me think again: the orbital period is three times shorter for Planet_1, so it's much closer in. So a smaller a, so higher transit probability.

So the answer is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), so the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( a \propto \left(M_* P^2\right)^{1/3} \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \) (host star mass is twice that of Planet_2's host), \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (orbital period is three times shorter).
- Planet_2: \( M_{*,2} \) and \( P_2 \).

Substituting these values, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{*,1} P_1^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{9^{1/3}} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2.
\]

From the earlier calculation, \( a_2/a_1 \approx 1.65 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher probability of transiting (~2.7 times higher than Planet_2).
