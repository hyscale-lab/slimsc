Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and resonance probably refers to their unstable state, so they decay quickly.

The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I'm trying to remember the formula for the mean decay distance. Oh right, the mean decay distance (let's call it L) depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula is something like L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh yeah, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Since Γ is given, I can compute τ. Then multiply by velocity to get the distance.

Wait, but particles like mesons are moving at relativistic speeds, so I need to calculate their velocity based on their energy and mass. Oh right, I'll need to find the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) first.

The production energy E is the total energy of the meson, which is equal to gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = γ * m. So gamma is E / m. Plugging in the numbers: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Next, the velocity beta (β = v/c) can be found using gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Let's compute that. Gamma is about 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. 1 over that is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, which means the velocity v is 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me make sure about the units. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is a very small time unit.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Therefore, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Then, the mean decay length L is v * τ. v is beta * c. Beta is 0.9887, so v = 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.0569e-24 s) ≈ 6.102e-16 m. Wait, but none of the options look like that. Let me check my calculations again.

Hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the computation step by step.

First, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Then gamma is E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Then, beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (1/(44.4444)) ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Gamma calculation for velocity: correct.

Now, calculating Γ: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v = beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:

2.966e8 = 2.966 x 10^8.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 x 10^-24.

Multiply 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that. 2 * 2.966 is about 5.932, but wait, 2.056875 is approximately 2.0569. 

2.966 * 2.0569 = ?

Hmm, 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.0569 = approximately 0.1686.

Adding them together: 5.932 + 0.1686 ≈ 6.1006.

So 6.1006e(8-24) = 6.1006e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 meters. But that's not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation with gamma and beta. Let me double-check.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... Correct.

Beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma^2.

1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.444444) ≈ 0.0225. Correct.

So beta squared is 0.9775, beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Tau: 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.0568e-24 s. Correct.

v is 0.9887 c ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Correct.

v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Wait, 2.966e8 is 2.966 x 10^8.

2.0568e-24 is 2.0568 x 10^-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.966 * 2.0568 ≈ let's calculate.

2 * 2.966 = 5.932.

0.0568 * 2.966 ≈ 0.168.

So total is about 6.1.

Wait, no, wait: 2.966 * 2.0568 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

2.0568 multiplied by 2.966:

Let me think: 2 * 2.0568 = 4.1136.

0.9 * 2.0568 = 1.85112.

0.06 * 2.0568 = 0.123408.

0.006 * 2.0568 = 0.0123408.

Adding them all: 4.1136 + 1.85112 = 5.96472.

Plus 0.123408 = 6.088128.

Plus 0.0123408 = 6.0999688.

So 2.966 * 2.0568 ≈ 6.100.

So the product is 6.100e(8-24) = 6.100e-16 meters.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a wrong approach. Maybe I should be using natural units or consider the decay width in a different way. Maybe I mixed up the formulas.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = (E * c * tau) / m, or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the mean lifetime being proportional to ħ / (Γ c^2) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the proper time.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the mean decay length L is given by (v * gamma * c * tau), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Wait, wait. Proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Γ). The lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So yes, that's correct. Because the lifetime dilates by gamma.

Wait, so my initial approach was correct. So why am I not getting any of the options? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.0568e-24.

Wait, 2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8 m/s.

2.0568e-24 is 2.0568 * 1e-24 seconds.

Multiplying them: (2.966 * 2.0568) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.100e-16 meters. Right.

So 6.1e-16 m. But the options are all in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. Let's look:

Option A: 5.0223e-16

Option D:4.0655e-16

Hmm, but I got 6.1e-16. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating beta.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately. Let's compute beta precisely.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So gamma squared is (6.666667)^2 = 44.444444.

1/gamma^2 is 1/44.444444 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me calculate that accurately.

Square root of 0.9775.

Hmm, 0.98^2 is 0.9604.

0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*(0.98)*(0.008) + 0.008^2.

Wait, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*(0.98*0.008) + 0.008^2.

Compute each term:

First term: 0.9604.

Second term: 2 * 0.98 * 0.008 = 2 * 0.00784 = 0.01568.

Third term: 0.008^2 = 0.000064.

So adding them: 0.9604 + 0.01568 = 0.97608 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

But our target is 0.9775, which is higher. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.

Let me try 0.989^2.

0.989 * 0.989.

Compute:

989 * 989.

Breaking it down: (1000 - 11)^2 = 1000000 - 2*1000*11 + 11^2 = 1,000,000 - 22,000 + 121 = 978,121.

Wait, 989 *989 = 978121. So 0.989^2 = 0.978121.

Which is higher than 0.9775. So the square root of 0.9775 is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Let me compute 0.9885^2.

0.9885 *0.9885.

Compute 9885 *9885.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute (9880 +5)^2.

9880^2 = (988)^2 *100.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 0.9885 = 0.988 + 0.0005.

So (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2 *0.988 *0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

We know 0.988^2 is 0.976144.

2 *0.988 *0.0005 = 0.000988.

0.0005^2 = 0.00000025.

Adding them: 0.976144 +0.000988= 0.977132 + 0.00000025=0.97713225.

Which is a bit less than 0.9775.

So 0.9885^2=0.97713225 <0.9775.

So to get to 0.9775, let's find x such that (0.9885 + dx)^2 = 0.9775.

We have:

(0.9885 + dx)^2 ≈ 0.97713225 + 2*0.9885 * dx = 0.9775.

So 2 *0.9885 * dx = 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

Solving for dx: dx ≈ 0.00036775 / (2*0.9885) ≈ 0.00036775 / 1.977 ≈ approximately 0.000186.

So beta is approximately 0.9885 + 0.000186 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.98869.

So more accurately, beta is approximately 0.9887.

So the velocity v is 0.9887 c.

So, v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 0.9887 * 3e8 = let's compute it.

3e8 is 300,000,000.

0.9887 *3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So v is 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.0568e-24 seconds.

So L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 * 2.0568e-24.

Let me compute that precisely.

2.9661e8 = 2.9661 × 1e8.

2.0568e-24 = 2.0568 × 1e-24.

Multiplying the coefficients: 2.9661 * 2.0568.

Let me compute that:

2 * 2.0568 = 4.1136.

0.9 * 2.0568 = 1.85112.

0.06 *2.0568=0.123408.

0.0061 *2.0568 ≈ 0.0061 *2=0.0122, 0.0061 *0.0568≈0.000346. So total 0.012546.

Adding all together:

4.1136 + 1.85112 = 5.96472.

+0.123408 →5.96472 +0.123408 = 6.088128.

+0.012546 →6.088128 +0.012546=6.100674.

So total coefficient is approximately 6.100674.

Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.100674 × 1e-16 meters.

Which is 6.100674e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options are:

A)5.0223 *1e-16

B)4.0655 *1e-15

C)5.0223 *1e-15

D)4.0655 *1e-16.

So none of these match 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should have used the width in GeV correctly. Let me double-check the units.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

But ħ is 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Correct.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582/0.32) ×1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32: let me compute that.

0.32 ×20 =6.4. 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 20 + (0.182/0.32) =20 + 0.56875 =20.56875.

So 6.582e-25 /0.32 =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Ah, perhaps I should not have multiplied v and tau directly. Maybe I should account for relativistic effects differently.

Wait, another formula: the mean decay distance is L = (E * c * tau) / (m). Wait, does that make sense?

Wait, E is gamma m c², so E = gamma m c².

Tau in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is ħ/(Γ).

So, L = v * tau = (beta c) * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ/(Γ).

So, L = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

Hmm, let's express beta in terms of gamma.

Beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, putting it all together:

L = c * gamma * beta * (ħ / Γ).

But E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²).

Wait, but E is given in GeV, which is energy units. So perhaps I should re-express ħ in eV·s.

But maybe it's better to compute everything in natural units where c=1.

Wait, another approach: using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

In natural units, the decay length L is (gamma * beta) * (tau_0).

Because L = v * tau_0 * gamma.

Wait, no, because tau_0 is proper time, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0.

So, L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma tau_0.

But v = beta c.

In natural units, c=1, so v = beta.

So L = beta * gamma * tau_0.

Tau_0 is ħ/(Γ), but in natural units, ħ=1, so tau_0 = 1 / Γ.

Wait, but in natural units, energy and inverse time have the same units. So if Gamma is in GeV, tau_0 is in 1 GeV.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of GeV and inverse GeV.

Wait, let's compute gamma beta.

Gamma = E/m = 8 /1.2 =6.666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 -1/44.444444) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So gamma * beta ≈6.6667 * 0.9887≈6.604.

So, gamma beta ≈6.604.

Now, tau_0 is ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = gamma beta * c * tau_0.

But wait, in natural units, c=1, so when units are in GeV and meters, we need to convert properly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute c * tau_0 in meters.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau_0 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 meters.

Then, L = gamma beta * c tau_0 ≈6.604 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.604 *6.170625e-16.

6 *6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.

0.604 *6.170625e-16= approx 3.728e-16.

Wait, 0.604 *6.170625e-16 = (0.6 *6.170625e-16) + (0.004 *6.170625e-16).

0.6 *6.170625e-16 =3.702375e-16.

0.004 *6.170625e-16=2.46825e-18.

So total 3.702375e-16 +2.46825e-18= 3.72698e-16.

So L ≈3.702375e-15 + 3.72698e-16 ≈4.075e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.075e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close. Hmm, but wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, no, let me recompute 6.604 *6.170625e-16.

6.604 *6.170625e-16.

Let me compute 6 *6.170625e-16 = 37.02375e-16 =3.702375e-15.

0.604 *6.170625e-16:

0.6 *6.170625e-16=3.702375e-16.

0.004 *6.170625e-16=2.46825e-18.

So 3.702375e-16 +2.46825e-18 =3.72698e-16.

Adding to the 3.702375e-15: 3.702375e-15 + 3.72698e-16 = 4.075073e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.075e-15 m. The closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps in the precise calculation, the numbers are slightly different. Maybe I should use more precise values for beta and gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma * beta more accurately.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 =6.6666666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 -1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/6.25)) ?

Wait, wait, (8/1.2)=6.6666667, so (8/1.2)^2=44.4444444.

So 1/(44.4444444)=0.0225.

So 1-0.0225=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that 0.988^2=0.976144.

0.9885^2=0.97713225.

0.989^2=0.978121.

We can use linear approximation between 0.9885 and 0.989.

We have 0.9885^2=0.97713225.

0.97713225 + delta =0.9775.

Delta=0.9775-0.97713225=0.00036775.

The difference between 0.9885^2 and 0.989^2 is 0.978121 -0.97713225 =0.00098875.

The fraction is 0.00036775 / 0.00098875 ≈0.372.

So, sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9885 + 0.372*(0.989-0.9885) =0.9885 +0.372 *0.0005=0.9885+0.000186=0.988686.

So beta ≈0.988686.

So gamma * beta = (8/1.2) *0.988686=6.6666667 * 0.988686≈ 6.60444.

So, 6.60444.

Now, c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s=6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply that by gamma*beta:

6.60444 *6.170625e-16=?

Let me compute 6.60444 *6.170625.

Compute 6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.60444 *6.170625=?

0.6 *6.170625=3.702375.

0.00444 *6.170625= approx:

0.004 *6.170625=0.0246825.

0.00044 *6.170625=0.0027187.

So sum: 0.0246825 +0.0027187=0.0274012.

So 3.702375 +0.0274012=3.7297762.

So total is 37.02375 +3.7297762=40.7535262.

So 40.7535262e-16 m =4.07535e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.075e-15 m.

The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Perhaps I made a slight approximation in beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used more precise values for factors like ħ.

Wait, maybe I used an approximate value for ħ. The precise value is ħ = 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me compute that exactly.

Tau_0 = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 =20.56875.

So tau_0=20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, that's correct.

So perhaps the difference comes from a more precise calculation of gamma*beta.

Wait, let's compute gamma*beta accurately.

gamma=8/1.2=6.666666666666667.

beta= sqrt(1- (1/(gamma^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444444)) ) = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988686.

So gamma * beta =6.666666666666667 *0.988686= let's compute it using more decimals.

6.666666666666667 *0.988686.

Let me compute:

6 *0.988686=5.932116.

0.666666666666667 *0.988686= approx 0.666666667 *0.988686.

0.666666667 *0.988686 = let's compute.

0.666666667 *0.988686 = (2/3) *0.988686 =1.977372/3 ≈0.659124.

So total gamma * beta ≈5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.

Wait, that's more accurate. So gamma*beta≈6.59124.

So then, L = gamma * beta * c tau_0.

c tau_0=3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s=6.170625e-16 m.

So L=6.59124 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.59124 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.59124 *6.170625= ?

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.00124 *6.170625=0.00766455.

Adding together:3.0853125 +0.55535625=3.64066875 +0.00766455=3.6483333.

So total is 37.02375 +3.6483333=40.6720833.

So 40.6720833e-16 m=4.06720833e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0672e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B:4.0655 *10^-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{8}{1.2} \right)^2 = 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Thus:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]

Substitute \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5912
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \cdot 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
