Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, detected via the RV method. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their orbits are circular, so no eccentricity to worry about.

The host stars have same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size. But the mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's star. Wait, so Star_1 (Planet_1's star) is more massive than Star_2.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The bigger the star, the lower the transit probability because the planet's orbit has to align just right for us to see it pass in front. Also, a closer planet (smaller orbital period) would have a higher probability because the orbit is more edge-on.

Wait, let me think about the formula for transit probability. I think it's something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (some function of the star's size and the planet's orbital distance). Or wait, more accurately, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)² times the probability that the inclination is right, which is (R_* / a)^2 * (something else).

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by the formula:

P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2

But wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by some factor. Let me think again. Oh, right, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is edge-on enough) is given by:

P = (R_star / a)^2 * ( (1 + sin i) / (something) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember it's approximately (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by the probability of alignment, which is something like (R_* / a) * something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is P ≈ (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the orbital semi-major axis. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because a is in astronomical units, but I think the transit probability is (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by some function, perhaps considering the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, another approach. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability of this is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller because the angle required is more likely. 

The exact formula for the transit probability is P = (R_* / a)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_p sin i)/(M_* cos i)) ) but since we have prior RV detection, we know that sin i is related to the RV measurements. Wait, but the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but because it's Earth-like and the period is known, perhaps that gives us the inclination.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on sin i. For Earth-like planets, if they're detected via RV, their inclination is known or at least constrained. So maybe in this scenario, the inclination is known, so the transit probability is just (R_* / a)^2, or perhaps a function of the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by (something else). Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability is P ≈ (R_* / a)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_*) )) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by (R_* / a)², so (R_* /a)^4? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the geometry. For a planet to transit, the orbital inclination must be such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. The probability of that happening is higher for planets with smaller a (shorter period) because the solid angle is smaller, so a higher chance that the line of sight is within the required angle.

The probability can be approximated as (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + e^2)) ), but since e is zero (they have circular orbits), it's just (R_* / a)^2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_*) )) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 + (M_p / M_*)^2 )) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it from the formula. The transit probability is given by:

P = (R_* / a)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_*)^2 )) )

Wait, but since the planets have the same mass and the stars have different masses, but the RV method gives the minimum mass, which depends on sin i. But since RV has already detected the planet, the inclination is known, so perhaps the mass is known accurately. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same masses, so M_p is the same for both. But the stars have different masses. Star_1 is twice as massive as Star_2.

But from the problem statement, the host stars have the same radii. So R_* is the same for both stars. Oh wait, the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_* is same for both, because it says both have same radii.

So R_* for Planet_1 and Planet_2 is same. So R_* is same. So for each planet, P is proportional to (R_* / a)^2. Since R_* is same, P is proportional to (1/a)^2.

But a is the semi-major axis. We know the orbital periods, so using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) P^2 )/(4π²). Since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to a ≈ ( (G M_* )^(1/3) ) * (P/(2π))^(2/3) )

Wait, but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate a as ( (G M_* )^(1/3) ) * ( P/(2π) )^(2/3 )

Wait, Kepler's third law is a^3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P^2 ) / (4 π² )

But since M_p is Earth-like, much smaller than stars, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a ≈ cube_root ( (G M_* P^2 ) / (4 π² ) )

But since G and 4π² are constants, we can relate a to M_* and P.

Given that, let's compute a for each planet.

Given that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Let's denote P1 = P, P2 = 3P.

Star_1 has mass 2M, Star_2 has mass M.

So for Planet_1: a1^3 = (G * 2M * P^2 )/(4 π² )

Similarly, Planet_2: a2^3 = (G * M * (3P)^2 )/(4 π² ) = (G M 9 P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 = (2 G M P^2 )/(4 π² ) = (G M P^2 )/(2 π² ) * 2 ?

Wait, maybe it's better to take the ratio of a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2M * P^2 ) ] / [ (M * (3P)^2 ) ]

Because the denominator in a^3 is 4π², which cancels out when taking the ratio.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M P^2 ) / ( M * 9 P^2 ) )= (2)/(9) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let's see, 9 is 3², so 2/9 = 2/(3²). The cube root is (2)^(1/3) / (3^(2/3)).

Alternatively, 2/9 = (2^1)/(3^2) → cube root is 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = (2/(9))^(1/3) = (2/9)^(0.333).

Alternatively, 2/9 ≈ 0.2222. Cube root of that is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a )^2. Since R_* is same for both, the probability P is proportional to (1/a)^2.

So P1 / P2 = (a2/( R_* ))^2 / (a1/( R_* ))^2 ) → (a2/a1)^2.

Wait, no: since P is proportional to (1/a)^2, then P1 = (1/a1)^2 and P2 = (1/a2)^2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = ( (1/a1)^2 ) / ( (1/a2)^2 ) ) = (a2 / a1 )^2.

We have a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. So a2/a1 is about 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait, so P1 is approximately 2.72 times P2.

Wait, but wait. If a1 is smaller than a2, then 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2. So (1/a1)^2 is larger than (1/a2)^2. So P1 is larger than P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but the options are about which planet is preferred. The question states that the researchers want to observe the one with higher probability.

So, which is higher, P1 or P2? Since a1 is smaller (since period is shorter and star is more massive), a1 < a2.

Transit probability is (R_*/a)^2. Since R_* is same, higher a → lower probability.

So if a1 is smaller, (R_*/a1) is larger, so (R_*/a1)^2 is larger, so P1 is higher.

So Planet_1 is preferred because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred. Option C says ~1.65 times, option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, earlier I had a1/a2 ≈ 0.606. So a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So the ratio (a2/a1)^2 is (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72. So P1 is (1/a1)^2, P2 is (1/a2)^2.

So P1 = (1/a1)^2 = (1/(0.606 a2))^2 = (1.65/a2)^2 → (1.65)^2 (1/a2)^2. P2 is (1/a2)^2.

So P1 is (1.65)^2 * P2 → approximately 2.7 times higher.

So P1 is approximately 2.7 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, and it's about 2.7 times higher.

Looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

1. Both planets have same mass.

2. Same R_* because problem says so.

3. Period of Planet_1 is 1/3 of Planet_2's period.

4. Star_1 is twice as massive as Star_2.

So using Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 = (2M) * P^2 / K → K is 4π²/G, a constant.

a2^3 = M * (3P)^2 / K → 9 M P^2 / K.

So a1^3 = (2 P^2 M) / K → (2 M P^2) / K.

a2^3 = (9 M P^2) / K.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2)/(9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

Then, (R_*/a1)^2 = (R_*/ (0.606 a2))² = (1/(0.606))² * (R_*/a2)^2 → (approx 2.72) * (R_*/a2)^2.

So Planet_1's transit probability is about 2.72 times higher than Planet_2's.

So the correct answer is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital semi-major axis of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), which is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

### Step 1: Compare orbital semi-major axes
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = P \), and its host star has mass \( M_{*,1} = 2M \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 = 3P \), and its host star has mass \( M_{*,2} = M \).

Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axes are proportional to:

\[
a_1^3 \propto M_{*,1} P_1^2 = 2M P^2
\]
\[
a_2^3 \propto M_{*,2} P_2^2 = M (3P)^2 = 9M P^2
\]

Taking the ratio:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2M P^2}{9M P^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compare transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability.

### Final Answer:
Planet_1 is preferred because it has a much higher transit probability, approximately 2.7 times that of Planet_2.
