Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down. So, I think the structure would have a cyclohexane ring attached to a methylene group (CH2), which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group (OH). Also, there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is an acetylene group, right? So ethynylcyclohexane would be a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached, like C≡C- connected to the ring.

I need to figure out the sequence of reagents that would transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. Let's look at the options (A to D) and think about each step.

First, what reactions are typically used to modify alkynes? I remember that alkynes can undergo several reactions like hydration, addition reactions, or being converted into different functional groups.

Looking at the target molecule, I notice there's a cyclohexyl group attached. Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane—so the triple bond is between two cyclohexane rings? Or is the triple bond just one end attached to cyclohexane? Wait, ethynylcyclohexane would have the structure cyclohexane-C≡CH, I think. Or maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-R, but here R is H?

Wait, ethynyl is like -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclo-C≡CH.

So, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH and a CH2-CHO group. Alternatively, the target structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

Wait, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that. The main chain is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So, the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2 connected to a cyclohexyl group, and all this is attached to the cyclohexane ring which also has a CHO group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is like a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a CHO group, and the other is a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, both substituents are attached to the same carbon on the cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that has a CH2 group attached to another cyclohexyl group and an OH group, and also a CHO group on the same ring.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. Maybe I should draw it. But since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about the steps needed to go from that to the target.

First, perhaps the triple bond needs to be functionalized. Let's see.

Option B has NaNH2 and ethyl chloride as the first step. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating things. Ethyl chloride would be an alkylating agent. So maybe an alkylation reaction.

Wait, NaNH2 is used in elimination or deprotonation reactions. For alkyne chemistry, maybe it's for deprotonating the alkyne to make it more nucleophilic. Or perhaps it's for the formation of an alkyne via dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which is already an alkyne.

Wait, maybe the first step is to perform a deprotonation of the alkyne to form a metal acetylide. So, with NaNH2 (a strong base), the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) would lose a proton, forming an acetylide.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexylacetylene) would become cyclohexylacetylide (the sodium salt) upon treatment with NaNH2. But what's the next step? In option A, the next reagent is methyl chloride. So, maybe an alkylation. The acetylide would attack methyl chloride as an electrophile. So, the acetylide (a strong nucleophile) would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group.

Wait, that would give (cyclohexyl)methyl group? Or perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, when you have an acetylide (like RC≡C-Na+) and you add an alkyl halide, like CH3Cl, the acetylide would attack the methyl, giving RC≡C-CH3. But that's just adding a methyl to the triple bond. So, after that, perhaps hydrogenation.

So, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically add two H2's to turn triple bond into single. So, R-C≡C-R' becomes R-CH2-CH2-R' after hydrogenation. Wait, no, that's when using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst or others. Wait, no, hydrogenation of alkynes can be done in different ways. Using H2 and a catalyst like Pd would lead to the alkene (cis addition) if the alkyne is hydrogenated partially. But if you use excess H2, it goes all the way to an alkane.

Wait, but in option A, step 2 is H2/Pd, which probably fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, so the triple bond (ethynyl) becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, the initial structure after step 1 would be the cyclohexylacetylide. Then adding methyl chloride would make (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would turn the triple bond into a single bond, so (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then the product would be 1-cyclohexylpropane or something. Hmm, but the target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents, not a longer chain.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me see the options again. Let's take option C as an example.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, same as before, forms the acetylide and alkylates with methyl chloride, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Wait, Pd with CaCO3 is usually for hydrogenation of ketones or other unsaturated groups. Wait, no, wait. Pd is used for hydrogenation, but the catalyst choice might affect the reaction. Oh, wait, H2/Pd is for hydrogenating triple bonds to single bonds, but in the presence of CaCO3, perhaps it's for hydrogenation to cis or trans? Or maybe it's a different type of hydrogenation.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about another approach. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So that's a vicinal diol situation? Or perhaps that's a result of some oxidation.

Wait, maybe the target molecule is synthesized via a series of reactions including oxidation, hydrogenation, and some kind of alkylation or addition.

Let's think about the target structure again. It's a cyclohexane with a formyl (CHO) group and a substituent that's a CH2 connected to both hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

So, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol attached to a CH2 group which is attached to the cyclohexane, which also has a CHO group.

Wait, maybe the synthesis involves forming a diol from an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of adding a functional group to the alkyne.

Let me think about the possible steps.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexylacetylene), step 1 in many options is NaNH2 and an alkylating agent. So, forming the acetylide and then alkylating. That would give a longer chain.

Then, perhaps hydrogenation to turn the alkyne into a single bond. So, after that, perhaps another functional group is introduced.

Wait, the target has a CHO group as well. How do we introduce a formyl group?

Hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions. For example, hydrolysis of an alkyne with H2O and HgSO4, H2SO4 would typically give a ketone (if internal) or an aldehyde (if terminal), depending on the structure.

Wait, but wait: hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give a ketone. Because, when you add water across a triple bond, you get a carbonyl group. For a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH), hydration would give R-CO-H (a ketone if R is not H). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hydration product of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) is a ketone (R-CO-CH2-OH?), no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no: The hydration of a terminal alkyne (like R-C≡CH) would produce an aldehyde (R-CHO), because the triple bond is between R and H. So, adding water would give R-CH(OH) which would tautomerize to R-CHO and H2O. So, that would form an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait, the hydration of an alkyne usually requires specific conditions. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts in a two-step process. First, the alkyne is treated with H2SO4, HgSO4, and water to form a diol, which upon acid workup gives the carbonyl compound.

Alternatively, catalytic hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene, followed by oxidation could give a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but let's think about each option.

Looking at option B: the steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So, step 1: Acetylide formation with ethyl chloride, giving a longer chain. Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is for elimination reactions, like deprotonating and forming a double bond. So, maybe an elimination to form an alkyne again? Or perhaps to form a trans-alkene via dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the target requires introducing a hydroxyl group via oxidation.

Wait, the target has a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps that hydroxyl is introduced via an epoxide opening or via some kind of dihydroxylation.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent that is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group.

So, perhaps we can think of the synthesis as follows:

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH, where R is cyclohexyl).

2. Form the acetylide and perform alkylation to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, maybe another approach. Maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, then manipulated further.

Wait, but the target has both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a diol via hydration, then oxidized or modified.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form acetylide, then alkylation to add methyl. So after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, the target is a cyclohexane with substituents, not a straight chain. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: acetylide, alkylation to add ethyl. So cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps deprotonation and elimination, forming a new triple bond or alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure. Li in liquid NH3 is often used for Birch reductions or for elimination reactions. Maybe it's used here for elimination, turning a vicinal dihalide into an alkene? Or perhaps it's used for deprotonation and elimination of a proton from an alkyne.

Wait, another thought: after alkylation, you have R-C≡C-Ethyl. Then treatment with Li/NH3 could cause elimination, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a method to form a trans-alkene. But I'm not entirely sure.

Then step 3: O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis. That would break double bonds into carbonyl groups.

But wait, how would that fit? If after step 2, we have an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But I'm not sure what the product would be.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps used to reduce any ozonides into aldehydes or ketones.

Hmm, maybe that's a way to form the aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: same as before, acetylide and alkylation to add methyl.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis followed by workup with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, we have a single bond, not a double bond. So this doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think again.

Option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Wait, Pd with CaCO3 is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but I'm not sure what that would do to a single bond. Maybe it's a different process.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond, which we don't have. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol: Hmm. Methanol is a methylating agent, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps forming the acetylide and then O-methylation? Wait, but methanol as an electrophile. So, after deprotonation, adding a methyl group from methanol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol: maybe it's used to generate a methyl group, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's for a conjugate addition.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly. Let me try to approach the problem from another angle.

The target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps one of the steps involves introducing the formyl group via oxidation.

Wait, oxidation of an alkyne to an aldehyde. How is that done?

Hydration of an alkyne (terminal) under acidic conditions (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) would give an aldehyde. So, if we can perform that, we could get the formyl group.

But then, how to introduce the hydroxymethyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via hydration, and then oxidized to form a carbonyl, but that's not quite matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps after adding the methyl group to the alkyne, hydrogenating it, and then performing some kind of oxidation or dihydroxylation.

Alternatively, think about epoxide opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2 connected to OH and another cyclohexyl group. So perhaps that substituent is formed via some kind of addition reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction or some nucleophilic addition.

Wait, let's think about the starting material again. Ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH, where R is cyclohexyl.

If I add a methyl group via alkylation, I get R-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenate that to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. So, R-C≡CH becomes R-CHO (aldehyde). That would introduce the formyl group.

Then, I need to add the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group to the same carbon.

Wait, that carbon already has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is also at position 1.

Wait, but that would mean that the same carbon has both an aldehyde and a substituent. That might not be possible because that carbon would be a carbonyl. So, maybe the substituent is on an adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the steps in the options.

Looking at option C again:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: forms R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenates the triple bond to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis. But R-CH2-CH2-CH3 doesn't have a double bond. So, I'm confused. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else. Wait, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but perhaps it's used in a different way.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene. If step 1 gives R-C≡C-CH3, then hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H2 across the triple bond. Maybe only partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups. So, if you have R-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. No, wait, if step 2 produces R-CH2-CH2-CH3, then it's a single bond, no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Hmm. Maybe I'm not looking at the right approach.

Another thought: perhaps the target molecule is formed via a propargyl alcohol intermediate. Propargyl alcohol can be oxidized to an aldehyde.

But how to get propargyl alcohol from ethynylcyclohexane?

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. Oxidation of the terminal alkyne could form a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a key reaction. Let's think about the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones. Maybe not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction. So, after forming the acetylide, adding a Grignard reagent or something.

Wait, but the options don't have Grignard reagents. They have reagents like NaNH2, H2/Pd, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an epoxide, but I don't recall a direct method for that.

Wait, another possibility: after forming the acetylide and alkylating, perhaps the product is R-C≡C-Ethyl. Then, hydrogenation would make R-CH2-CH2-Ethyl, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used in a conjugate addition to form a diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the target is formed via a cyclopropanation, but that seems unrelated.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a series of steps including alkyne alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, and then some addition.

Let me think about each step in option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: acetylide formed, then methylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis of what? We don't have any double bonds. Unless step 2 actually didn't go to completion, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, turning the triple bond into a double bond. Let me think: H2 and Pd in presence of CaCO3. I think that's a hydrogenation catalyst but for ketones or alkenes. Wait, no, perhaps for hydrogenating triple bonds to cis alkenes. So, R-C≡C-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3 fully hydrogenated? Or maybe R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is the product. So, not helpful for ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Let me think about each reagent's typical use.

- NaNH2: deprotonates terminal alkynes to form acetylides, which are strong bases.
- H2/Pd: hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds (alkanes), or double bonds to single bonds.
- Ozonolysis (O3) followed by reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S) would break double bonds into carbonyl groups.
- Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions (like the Bayer-Villiger?), but more commonly in epoxide ring openings or in the elimination of H2O to form alkenes.
- H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: these are used for the hydration of alkynes to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group and then adding a hydroxyl group.

Another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a diol via hydration, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like R-C≡CH) under H2SO4 and HgSO4 would give a ketone. So R-C≡CH → R-COH (a ketone if R is non-adjacent). Wait, but if R is cyclohexyl, then R-C≡CH would hydrate to cyclohexylpropanal? Or would it be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde?

Wait, no, hydration of R-C≡CH would give R-CHO, because the triple bond is between R and H. So, for ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexylacetylene, R-C≡CH), hydration would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (R-CHO), where R is cyclohexyl attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, that would give the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part of the target. So, that's one part done.

Then, how to introduce the hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we need to add a substituent to the cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can then undergo further reactions.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly have a step that would introduce a hydroxyl group via hydration of the alkyne. So perhaps that's not the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is alkylated and then hydrogenated, and then some kind of dihydroxylation occurs.

Wait, thinking about option B again.

Option B steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: forms R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps elimination to form an alkene. So, R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is used for dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, after alkylation, would there be a leaving group? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a method for forming alkenes from alkynes.

Wait, another thought: Using Luche's reagent (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)3) can perform hydroboration of alkynes to form alkenes. But I'm not sure if Li in NH3 is used for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene using H2 and a poisoned catalyst. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is deprotonating to form a strong base, which then abstracts a proton elsewhere, leading to an elimination reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that is a CH2 connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution. Or perhaps via a Grignard addition.

Wait, maybe the hydroxymethyl group is added via some kind of addition reaction to a carbonyl.

Wait, but where would the carbonyl be? Maybe after forming the aldehyde, we can perform a nucleophilic addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a dihydroxylation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. So perhaps the substituent is formed by adding a group to the cyclohexane ring. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is formed by hydroboration of a double bond, adding an -OH and a -CH2 group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the target is formed via a propargyl alcohol intermediate, where the triple bond is converted into an alcohol, which then undergoes further reactions.

But again, I'm not sure.

Let me look back at the options to see if any make sense.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol.

So, deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then maybe O-methylation. But that's unclear. Maybe it's a different reaction.

2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

3. O3, (CH3)2S: ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH: perhaps a workup, like reducing ozonides.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Alkyne to aldehyde via hydration.

2. Then, introduce the hydroxymethyl group via some addition.

But I don't see a step in any of the options that directly hydrates the alkyne to form the aldehyde.

Wait, looking at the options, option A includes Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Oh wait, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, such as the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or for epoxide ring opening.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form R-C≡C-R'.

2. Triple bond is hydrogenated to single bond.

3. Oxidation to introduce a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration (using H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O), giving an aldehyde. Then, another step to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at option C again: the steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is O3, which wouldn't do anything. So option C can't be right.

Option D: after step 1 and 2, perhaps we have an alkene. Let me think.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2, methanol. So perhaps the acetylide is formed and then O-methylated. But I'm not sure. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which could be for elimination to form a double bond.

So, suppose after step 1, we have R-C≡C-OCH3. Then step 2 would eliminate to form R-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it systematically.

The target has:

- Cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO).
- Same ring has a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)-OH and -(CH2)-cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So, the substituent is -(CH2)-OH and -(CH2)-cyclohexyl.

Wait, but that would mean the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both OH and cyclohexyl. So, it's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Hmm. Let me think about how such a group can be introduced.

One possible way is to have a propargyl alcohol (R-C≡C-CH2-OH), then add a cyclohexyl group via some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition. For example, adding a cyclohexyl group to the triple bond, then some oxidation.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: think about the functional groups needed and the possible reagents.

The target has a formyl group, which could come from hydrating the alkyne. Then, the hydroxymethyl group comes from perhaps an epoxide opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a propargyl alcohol intermediate. Let me think.

If I can get propargyl alcohol (R-C≡C-CH2-OH), then perhaps I can add a cyclohexyl group via a substitution or addition.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via hydration, and then the diol is oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form acetylide, then alkylate with methyl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, this path doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a straight chain. The target has a ring substituent. So perhaps that's not the case.

Another thought: perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction after forming the aldehyde.

Wait, if I have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (R-CHO), perhaps I can add a Grignard reagent to form R-CH(OH)-R'. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via a hydroboration reaction on an alkene.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-R'.

2. Triple bond is hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-R'.

3. Then, some kind of oxidation creates a carbonyl group.

4. Then, a dihydroxylation or epoxide opening adds the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Oxidized to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but oxidation of a straight chain alkane wouldn't form a carbonyl group. Unless it's a specific oxidation, but I don't think that's possible.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is the right one.

Option B steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: forms R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps elimination to form a double bond, R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2? No, that wouldn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: Li in NH3 is a strong base and can cause deprotonation. Maybe it's used for deprotonating an alcohol to form an alkoxide, which can then attack an electrophilic site.

But I'm not sure.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis. So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH: a mild reducing agent, perhaps used to reduce ozonides to aldehydes.

Wait, but how does this lead to the target?

Suppose step 2 produces an alkene, R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2 with a double bond. Then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think.

Alternative approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) substituent.

So, perhaps the CHO comes from the alkyne's hydration, and the substituent comes from another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then dihydroxylated, and then the diol is oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via partial oxidation, then undergoes some addition.

Wait, but I'm stuck.

Another approach: think about the reagents in each option and see which sequence can produce the target.

Option A: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride → H2/Pd → Ba(OH)2 → H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, step 1: acetylide and methylate → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → not sure, perhaps elimination.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration.

Wait, after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So, R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH2- ? No, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can induce elimination, but in that molecule, without a leaving group, elimination is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening or other eliminations.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol → Li in NH3 → O3, (CH3)2S → NH4OH.

So, step 1: acetylide and O-methylation? Or some alkylation. Not sure.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination or deprotonation.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → requires a double bond.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous workup.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target's structure again. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which also has a formyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed by adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group. So, the aldehyde (from the triple bond) would react with a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) to form the alcohol.

But none of the options include a Grignard reagent. So, perhaps that's not the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition of a cyclohexyl group to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the reagents.

Looking at option C again:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: acetylide, methylated → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: but no double bond, so nothing happens. So this can't be correct.

Option B:

After step 1, we have R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps eliminate to form an alkene. So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2? No, but wait, Li in NH3 is a strong base, which can abstract a proton adjacent to the triple bond, causing elimination to form an alkene. So, R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between R and C≡C. Wait, perhaps the structure after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So, the triple bond is between the cyclohexyl group and the C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 with Li in NH3 could abstract a proton from the CH2CH3 group, leading to the formation of a double bond: R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 ? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a different elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is causing the triple bond to undergo elimination, but I'm not certain.

Then, step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Finally, step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps to reduce any ozonide intermediates to aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this would form the target molecule.

Hmm. It's challenging, but I think I need to make an educated guess based on the steps.

The target has a formyl group, which is likely from the hydration of a terminal alkyne. So, the earliest step where that could happen is when the alkyne is exposed to H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O (hydration reagents). Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, but step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is unclear.

Wait, option A's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination, but I'm not sure.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration.

But after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. How would Ba(OH)2 act on that? Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used to form a ketone or aldehyde from an alcohol. But where would the alcohol come from?

Hmm.

Option B's step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent. Could this be used to reduce an ozonide to an aldehyde?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-R'.

2. Triple bond is hydrogenated to single bond.

3. The resulting molecule is oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

But I'm not seeing an option that fits this.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a propargyl alcohol intermediate, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde and has the hydroxymethyl group added.

But I don't see any option that includes this.

Another thought: the target has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents. Perhaps the substituents are introduced via two separate alkylation steps.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I've thought through all the possibilities as much as I can. Given the options, I'm going to make an educated guess that the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, why? Because option C's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup for ozonolysis, leading to aldehydes or ketones. So, perhaps after forming the correct double bond, ozonolysis would introduce the formyl group.

But earlier, I thought that after step 2, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't work. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps after step 2 in option C, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which doesn't have any double bonds. So ozonolysis is impossible. Therefore, option C can't be correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong again.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3.

If step 1 forms the acetylide and then O-methylates it, perhaps forming R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 could cause elimination, forming an alkene. So, R-C≡C-OCH3 → R-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, but perhaps it forms R-C≡C-OCH3 → R-CH2-CH2-OCH3 via elimination. Not sure.

But then, step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But again, without a double bond, it wouldn't do anything.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of the double bond to a carbonyl.

So, after step 3, if Ba(OH)2 causes elimination, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to induce an elimination reaction to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 would induce elimination, but without a good leaving group, it's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to oxidize an alcohol to a ketone, but I don't see where the alcohol comes from.

Hmm.

This is really challenging. I think the correct answer is option C. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option B.

Wait, another approach: the target has both a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So, maybe one step forms the aldehyde, another forms the alcohol.

Looking at the options, option B includes O3 and H2O, which could form carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH could reduce ozonides to aldehydes.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-R'.

2. Partially hydrogenate to form a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

4. Reduce to aldehydes.

But I'm not sure which option fits.

I think I'll have to make a guess. Based on the steps, I'll go with option D.

Wait, option D's step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, perhaps it's forming an acetylide and then O-methylation, giving R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination to form an alkene, R-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → breaks the double bond into two carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → reduces ozonides to aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this forms the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexylacetylene), and the sequence of reagents must transform the alkyne into the desired structure.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with methyl, yielding cyclohexylacetylene methylated to R-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its role is unclear in this context.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Hydration reagents, typically used to convert alkynes to carbonyl compounds. However, after full hydrogenation in step 2, no alkyne remains to undergo hydration.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule, as the final steps do not introduce the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with ethyl, yielding R-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely induces elimination, forming an alkene (R-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2 becomes R-CH2-CH=CH2).
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, possibly reducing ozonides to aldehydes.

This sequence could potentially introduce the formyl group, but it does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is added to the cyclohexane ring.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with methyl, yielding R-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partially hydrogenates the triple bond to a cis-alkene, resulting in R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but after full hydrogenation in step 2, no double bond remains to undergo cleavage.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its role is unclear in this context.

This sequence is inconsistent with the target molecule, as ozonolysis cannot proceed without a double bond.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Forms the acetylide and possibly O-methylates it, yielding R-C≡C-OCH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely induces elimination, forming an alkene (R-C≡C-OCH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-OCH3).
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, possibly reducing ozonides to aldehydes.

This sequence could potentially introduce the formyl group, but it does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is added to the cyclohexane ring.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves steps that could potentially introduce the formyl group and other necessary functional groups, even though some steps are unclear or incomplete.
