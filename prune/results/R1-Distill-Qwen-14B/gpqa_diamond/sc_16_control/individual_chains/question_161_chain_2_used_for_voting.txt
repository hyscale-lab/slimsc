Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is that with such low pressure, there aren't many gas molecules around, which is good for electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less scattering of the electron beam, right?

But even after creating that vacuum, some gas particles remain, and the mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So, it depends on factors like pressure and temperature.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2, and it's not the same as λ1. But the temperature of the sample compartment is the same, so T hasn't changed. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path in a gas depends on the pressure, but also on the presence of other particles. But in this scenario, the pressure was already very low, so maybe the electron beam is somehow affecting the gas molecules?

Oh right! When the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can cause various effects in the vacuum. One possibility is that the electrons collide with the gas molecules, ionizing them. Ionized gas molecules would behave differently. Also, the presence of the electron beam might cause some of the gas to be pumped out more effectively, but that's probably not the case here because the initial vacuum is already ultra-high.

Wait, another thought: gas molecules in the compartment might have an induced electric charge due to the electron beam. If the gas molecules become charged, they might interact more with the electron beam, but how does that affect their mean free path?

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be excited or even dissociated. But I'm not sure how that would change their mean free path.

Wait, the mean free path is determined by the collisions between gas molecules themselves, right? So if the electron beam somehow changes the effective pressure of the gas, it would change λ. But the pressure is already ultra-low, so maybe the beam isn't significantly changing the pressure.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be scattered, effectively increasing the collision rate. So more frequent collisions would mean a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path is calculated based on the gas's own pressure and temperature. If the electron beam is introducing more collisions, perhaps the effective pressure is higher, but that might not be the case because the electron beam's presence would affect the gas in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the electrons is affected, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Hmm.

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1 in the vacuum state. When the electron beam is on, are the electrons interacting with the gas molecules more, causing the gas to have more collisions? Or is there another effect?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized, effectively changing the gas from neutral to charged particles. If the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path might change. Because ionized particles might interact differently with each other and the chamber walls.

Wait, but the mean free path is for the gas molecules themselves. If the gas is ionized, their effective cross-sectional area for collisions might change. For example, ions have different sizes compared to neutral molecules, so the effective diameter d might change, which would affect the mean free path.

If the gas molecules become ionized, their diameter could increase, perhaps. Or maybe the effective cross-section increases because ions have a charge, leading to more interactions. If d increases, the mean free path would decrease because λ is inversely proportional to d squared.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1, since d is larger now when the gas is ionized. So λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path might actually increase. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think about it.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the mean free path could increase because ions can have longer paths before being scattered. Or maybe the opposite. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another angle: the problem says that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path changes. But the temperature remains the same. So what changes is either the pressure or the effective diameter.

In the initial state (without the beam), the mean free path is λ1 based on the pressure and temperature. When the beam is on, perhaps the electron beam energy causes the gas to be more active, increasing the pressure. But does that happen? Or perhaps the beam causes some of the gas to be pumped out, but that's more about the vacuum level, which was already ultra-high.

Wait, another possibility: The electron beam imparts energy to the gas molecules, increasing their kinetic energy. So if the temperature effectively increases, then the mean free path would increase because λ is proportional to temperature. But the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so T hasn't changed. So any increase in molecular speed would be due to other factors, but the mean free path's dependence on T is from the kinetic theory, which assumes thermal equilibrium. Since the temperature is the same, maybe the mean free path shouldn't change. But Mike's observation says it does.

Hmmm. So why is λ2 different from λ1?

Wait, in the absence of the electron beam, the mean free path λ1 is calculated considering only the gas's own pressure and temperature. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might experience additional forces or interactions, like scattering from the beam. So the gas molecules are now colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons in the beam. That would effectively increase the collision rate, which would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path is about the average distance between collisions among the gas molecules themselves. Or does it include collisions with other things, like the chamber walls?

Wait, the mean free path is usually the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, which can be with other gas molecules or the walls. So in a vacuum, the mean free path is the distance before a collision occurs, whether it's with another molecule or a wall.

In this case, the presence of the electron beam introduces another source of collisions for the gas molecules. The electrons in the beam could collide with the gas molecules. So each gas molecule now has more opportunities to collide not just with other gas molecules but also with electrons.

So the effective cross-section for collisions would increase because now each gas molecule can collide with either another gas molecule or an electron. So the collision rate increases, meaning the mean free path decreases.

Therefore, in the presence of the electron beam, the mean free path λ2 would be shorter than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer would be C.

In a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr), Mike observed a change in the mean free path of gas molecules from λ1 to λ2 when the electron beam was activated. Initially, λ1 was determined based on the vacuum pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path, λ, is inversely proportional to the square of the molecular diameter, \( d^2 \), and directly proportional to temperature, \( T \), as described by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant and \( P \) is pressure. When the electron beam is activated, it introduces additional interactions between the gas molecules and the high-energy electrons in the beam. These interactions can ionize the gas molecules or increase their effective cross-sectional area for collisions, effectively increasing the collision rate. As a result, the mean free path decreases because the gas molecules collide more frequently, either with each other or with the electron beam.

Since the temperature remains constant, the change in the mean free path is not due to a change in \( T \). Instead, the presence of the electron beam alters the effective pressure or the collision dynamics, leading to a shorter mean free path, \( \lambda_2 \), compared to \( \lambda_1 \). Therefore, \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

Given the options, the correct conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).
