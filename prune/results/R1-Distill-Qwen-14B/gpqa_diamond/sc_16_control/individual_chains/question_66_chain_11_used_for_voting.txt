Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries listed as 1 through 4, and the choices are combinations of them.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible interactions allowed by the Standard Model, but with higher-dimensional operators. But wait, does SMEFT respect certain symmetries?

I recall that the Standard Model itself has certain symmetries. For example, the SM is Lorentz invariant, right? So Lorentz symmetry is a big one. That would mean SMEFT operators must preserve Lorentz symmetry because they are part of the effective theory extending the SM. So 1 (Lorentz Symmetry) must be correct.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, the Poincaré group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations in spacetime. But do all SMEFT operators respect Poincaré? Or is it more about the fact that the SM respects Poincaré, so the effective theory must as well? I think that SMEFT operators are included into the SM Lagrangian, so they must respect the same symmetries. So Poincaré symmetry (2) would also be a symmetry that SMEFT operators must respect. So that would make 1 and 2 correct.

Wait, but sometimes people talk about when building operators, certain symmetries must be preserved. For example, in the SM, the Higgs field is part of a symmetry breaking pattern. But SMEFT could include operators that violate some of the SM's symmetries, but perhaps not the fundamental ones like Lorentz and Poincaré.

Now, what about CP symmetry (3) and CPT symmetry (4)? CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry in general because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. For example, the operator (S) in the oblique parameters measures a CP violation effect. So not all SMEFT operators respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. I think the SM respects CPT symmetry, but does SMEFT? Operators in SMEFT can include terms that violate CPT? Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, CPT is a combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric because it's Lorentz invariant and respects P and T in certain combinations. But can SMEFT operators violate CPT? I think that in the effective theory, you can have operators that violate any symmetry unless the operator's dimension imposes it. Wait, for example, higher-dimensional operators can violate various symmetries.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which of these symmetries are absolute, and which can be broken?

So Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincaré (2) are about spacetime symmetries. Since the SM and therefore SMEFT are Lorentz invariant, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, which SMEFT should also respect, as all the operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory.

But does SMEFT allow for operators that violate Poincaré symmetry? No, because the SMEFT framework assumes that the SM is correct up to some high energy scale, so the effective theory must be Lorentz invariant. So 1 and 2 must be correct.

Then, for the other options:

3. CP symmetry: As I thought, SM doesn't have CP, so SMEFT operators don't have to respect it. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM respects CPT. But can SMEFT operators violate it? Or does the effective theory require CPT preservation?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT is a symmetry. Because SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT symmetry. Because the CPT theorem holds for any Lorentz-invariant QFT, which includes SMEFT.

So, if all operators respect Lorentz symmetry, then they must also respect CPT. Hence, 4 must be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose an operator in SMEFT violates CPT. But if it's Lorentz-invariant, how could it violate CPT? Because the CPT theorem states that in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. So if SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, then CPT must be a symmetry of the theory. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: yes.

2. Poincaré: yes, because Lorentz and translations are part of it. Wait, but Poincaré includes translations. Are SMEFT operators built such that they are invariant under translations? Because the SM is Poincaré-invariant, so SMEFT must be as well. All terms in the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant, which they are because the operators are part of the Lagrangian density. So yes, 2 is correct.

3. CP: Not necessarily. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT: Yes, because Lorentz symmetry implies CPT. So 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4 → which would be A, B, C, D? Let me check the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2 → so 1 and 2 correct.

B) 3,4 → no.

C) 1,2,4 → yes, that's what I concluded.

D) 1,3,4 → no, because 3 is wrong.

Wait, but wait a second. Poincaré symmetry is a bigger symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincaré, then it respects both Lorentz and translations. But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So for the operators, do they have to respect both Lorentz and Poincaré, or is Poincaré automatically implied by Lorentz?

Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. Since all the terms in the Lagrangian must be Poincaré-invariant, because the SMEFT is part of the effective theory that is Lorentz and translation-invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré. So 1 and 2 are correct.

But earlier I thought that CPT is also required because of Lorentz symmetry. So the correct symmetries would be 1,2,4.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4 and option A is 1,2.

Wait, the question is, which must be respected by all operators.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz scalars. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense. So yes, 1 is correct.

2. Poincaré symmetry: This includes Lorentz and translations. All operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar under translations. So yes, 2 must be correct.

3. CP symmetry: Not necessarily. Because operators can have terms that break CP. For example, if the operator involves terms that change under C or P. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: Since the theory is Lorentz invariant, and the CPT theorem applies, all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So which options in the question? The question is, which must be respected by all operators? So 1,2,4 are correct.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm recalling that the SMEFT operators are classified by their Lorentz indices and other quantum numbers. So the operators must be Lorentz scalars, respecting Lorentz symmetry. And since the theory is Poincaré invariant, because the SM is, the operators must respect that as well.

But wait, is Poincaré symmetry automatically included if the theory is Lorentz invariant and the operators have the right structure? Because Poincaré includes translations, which are automatically handled in the Lagrangian. So perhaps the operators themselves don't need to carry any Poincaré indices because the Lagrangian's structure takes care of it. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the question is about the operators as separate entities or as part of the Lagrangian.

Wait, the question says "all operators in the SMEFT". So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So yes, 1 is correct. Poincaré includes translations, and since the Lagrangian is translation-invariant, the operators are part of that, so the operators must respect translation invariance. So yes, 2 is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on whether Poincaré symmetry is a separate requirement beyond Lorentz. Because if the theory is already Lorentz-invariant, then translation invariance is part of the framework, so Poincaré is automatically satisfied. Do the operators themselves have to respect Poincaré, or is it handled at the Lagrangian level?

Hmm. Maybe the question is phrased such that all operators must respect the symmetries. So an operator must individually be a scalar under Lorentz and Poincaré. But wait, Poincaré includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. But individual operators, like the kinetic term, are scalars, so they're Poincaré-invariant.

Wait, probably 1,2, and 4 are correct, so the answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that incorporates all possible interactions consistent with the SM symmetries, but with higher-dimensional operators. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM, and therefore SMEFT, is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Thus, Lorentz symmetry (1) is correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is built as an effective theory extending the SM, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry (2) is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP symmetry, so CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. Thus, (3) is incorrect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that in a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry (4) is correct.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**
