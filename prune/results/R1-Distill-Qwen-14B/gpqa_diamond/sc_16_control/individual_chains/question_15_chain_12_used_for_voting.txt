Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's see what the question says.

Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. So they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but both have the same mass, right? So their masses are equal. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, so Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1. 

Both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, same radius but different masses. I remember that more massive stars are usually bigger, but in this case, they've evolved a bit so Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same radius. So maybe Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something, same size as a main-sequence star but more massive.

I need to find the transit probability for each planet. I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula for the probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's R_planet divided by a. No, wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the star's size, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star. The formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e)), but since both have circular orbits, e is 0. So the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since the planet radius is much smaller than the star's radius, maybe we can approximate this as R_star / a. Because R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so R_star >> R_planet, so R_star + R_planet ≈ R_star. So P ≈ R_star / a.

Alternatively, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. The transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a))) ), but wait, that doesn't seem right. No, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but perhaps more accurately, it's (R_planet / a) multiplied by something else? Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I remember now. The probability that a planet transits its star, from our point of view, is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So P = (2R_star) / (2a) ) → P = R_star / a. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbit's plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's size to the orbit's size. So P = (R_star) / (a * (1 - e)), but since e=0, it's R_star / a.

So the probability is higher when R_star is larger or when a is smaller. Because if the star is larger, same a, higher P. Also, if a is smaller, same R, higher P.

In this problem, the host stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2 = R. So the transit probability depends on R/a. So a is the semi-major axis, which relates to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. 

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M + m)) / (4π^2). Since the planets are Earth-like, their mass m is much smaller than the star's mass M, so we can approximate it as (a^3)/(P^2) ≈ G M / (4π²).

So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a = [ (G M P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3). But since M is the star's mass, and P is the orbital period, a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So given that, let's compute a1 and a2.

For Planet_1, M1 = 2 M2, because M1 is twice that of M2. Planet_1's period is P1 = (1/3) P2. So let me write a1 in terms of a2.

a1 = [ (G M1 P1^2) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
Similarly, a2 = [ (G M2 P2^2) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

So let's take the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (P1 / P2)^2 ) ]^(1/3)

We know M1 = 2 M2, so M1/M2 = 2.

P1 = (1/3) P2, so (P1/P2)^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So (M1/M2) * (P1/P2)^2 = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9).

Let me calculate that. 2 is about 2, 9 is 3^2. So 2/9 ≈ 0.222.

The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

Alternatively, cube root of 2/9.

Wait, 2/9 = (2)/(3^2) = 2/(9). So cube root(2/9) = cube_root(2)/cube_root(9) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Now, the transit probability P is R_star / a. Since R_star is the same for both, P is inversely proportional to a.

So P1/P2 = (R / a1) / (R / a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1 / (a1/a2) = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the probability is R/a, so if a1 is smaller than a2, then P1 is higher than P2.

So since a1 is 0.6 a2, P1 = R/(0.6 a2) and P2 = R/a2. So P1 = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) → (5/3) ≈ 1.666 times P2.

So P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2.

Wait, but the options are about which planet has a higher probability. Wait, the question says the researchers want to observe the one with higher probability. So since P1 is higher, they should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher. So my calculation gives about 1.65 times, which matches option C.

Wait, but earlier when I did a1/a2 as 0.606, so a1 is 0.606 a2. So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Wait, no. Wait a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1. So a2 is larger than a1.

But since P is R/a, and R is same, P1 is R/(0.6 a2) → R/a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) ) = 1.666 * (R/a2) = 1.666 * P2.

So P1 = 1.666 * P2 → so Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the probability of Planet_1 is higher than that of Planet_2 by a factor of ~1.65.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, which has about 1.65 times higher probability to transit. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning because it's easy to get confused with the proportions.

So, transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since R_star is same, it's inversely proportional to a.

a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3). So a1 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) → (2 * (1/9) )^(1/3) M2 P2^(2/3) → ( (2/9) )^(1/3) a2.

Wait, because a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2²)^(1/3). So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2.

Which is about 0.606 times a2, as before.

Thus, P1 = R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) → (1/0.606) * (R/a2) = 1.65 * (R/a2) ) = 1.65 * P2.

So yes, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So option C is correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)), the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \).

The semi-major axis \( a \) can be related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M \) using Kepler's third law: 

\[
a^3 \propto M \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2, we have the following relationships:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2}{1} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A:** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability to transit.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability to transit.
- **Option C:** Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher probability to transit.
