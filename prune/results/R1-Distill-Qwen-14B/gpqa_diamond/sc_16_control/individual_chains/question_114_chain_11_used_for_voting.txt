Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes that product (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) and uses reagent B (in water) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, let me think about each step. Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, it's a ketone. Adding NaCN and some reagent A. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, the product is a hydroxy nitrile—so maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation typically involves adding a nitrile and an acid catalyst. So the reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ (sulfuric acid maybe) because the reaction usually requires protonation to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. So for the first part, A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+; C and D have NaHSO3. So, maybe C and D are for some kind of sulfonamide or something else, but I think for cyanohydrin, it's acid catalyzed. So probably A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile) is being treated with reagent B in water to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I think that usually, nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic or basic conditions. For hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, acidic conditions are probably used, like using HCl or another strong acid. Alternatively, sometimes it's done under basic conditions but then acidified.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile (R-CN) becomes R-COOH. The hydrolysis conditions must be acidic. So the reagent B is probably a strong acid, like HCl. Because in the second step, the reagent is B, which is H2O—so maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl. Looking back at the options: Option A has B as HCl, option C has B as HCl. So the first part, A is H3O+; second part, B is HCl.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That fits both steps.

Wait, let me double-check. The first reaction's reagent is NaCN and H3O+ (which would protonate the carbonyl). The product is the cyanohydrin. Makes sense. Then, the second reagent is HCl in water, which would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, it's a more substituted compound, but the same logic applies. The nitrile group (CN) would be converted to COOH under acidic hydrolysis.

So option A seems correct. But let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

Wait, but what about using NaHSO3 as a reagent? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is an acid. Could that be used in the first reaction? Well, H3O+ is typically H2SO4 or HCl, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, I think. H3O+ is more about protonation, which is needed for the ketone to react with CN-.

So for first step, the correct reagent is H3O+ (so options A and B have that for A). Then, for the second step, B is HCl (so option A and C have that).

So the correct option should be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but in the second reaction, if B is HCl, then the product is the acid. Alternatively, sometimes nitrile hydrolysis can use H2SO4 or other acids. But I think HCl would be suitable.

Alternative approach: The first step is definitely acid-catalyzed cyanohydrin. So A must be an acid. So options A and B are the only possibilities for A. Then, the second step: hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. For that, HCl is a common reagent.

So option A: A=H3O+ and B=HCl is correct.

Wait, but when I look at the options, the choices for B in option A is HCl. So that fits.

Alternatively, I thought about what the options are for B: in the first part, reagent A is H3O+ and in the second, B is HCl (option A). So I think that's correct.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the nitrile ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the appropriate acid catalyst for this reaction, as it facilitates the protonation of the carbonyl group. This eliminates options C and D, which use NaHSO₃ as reagent A, as NaHSO₃ is not suitable for this purpose.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions, such as HCl in water. Among the options, HCl (B = HCl) is the correct reagent for this step. This confirms that option A, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, is the correct choice.

Option B is incorrect because, while A = H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, B = CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
