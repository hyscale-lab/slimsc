Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Alright, so I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move. The Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So a larger shift would mean a higher velocity.

Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? Hmm. Oh right, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^2) / (M_star * (1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ) )^(1/1)

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version since the eccentricity is mentioned as circular (e=0), so that term goes away. So the formula simplifies because e=0.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass (M), and both planets have similar masses (but maybe same? The question says 'similar to Neptune', so perhaps same mass as each other? Or same as Neptune but perhaps not same as each other? Wait, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so probably same for both planets. So M_p is the same for both.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star) * (1 / P) )^(1/3) — wait, no, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p is much less than M_star (since Neptune's mass is about 1/7000th of the Sun's mass, and the stars are like the Sun), so M_p/M_star is negligible. So 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ [ (G P )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator M_star^(2/3) dominates, and the (1 + ...) term is approximately 1. So K ≈ ( (G/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of proportionality. Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, the ratio of K for planet 2 to K for planet 1 would be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, wait, let me get this straight.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / ( (2π) * (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for the more precise formula.

Oh wait, I think a better approach is to set up the ratio of K2 to K1.

Since both stars have the same mass (M), and both planets have the same mass (m), then:

K2/K1 = ( (P1/P2) )^(1/3) * (something else?)

Wait, let me think again.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * π )^(1/3) ) * ( (G )^(1/3) ) * ( m sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula correctly. The correct formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( 1/(2π)^(1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

Therefore, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which implies that P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

Wait, that's interesting. So the period is inversely proportional to the cube of K.

So for the same star mass and same planet mass, the period would be inversely proportional to K^3.

But wait, in this problem, the stars are the same, and the planets have similar masses (so same for both), so the ratio of periods should be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me make sure.

If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

But wait, let me think in terms of the formula.

K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so when K increases, P decreases.

So for two planets with K1 and K2, their periods are P1 and P2.

So K1 = A / P1^(1/3)

K2 = A / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Which implies that P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So the period of planet 2 is (K1/K2)^3 times the period of planet 1.

But in our question, K2 is larger than K1: planet #1's shift is 5, planet #2's is 7. So K2 is 7/5 times K1.

Wait no, wait. The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity K. So if the shift is 5 milliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2, then K1 is 5 and K2 is 7.

So K2 = (7/5) K1.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, from earlier: P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Since K1 =5, K2=7, K1/K2=5/7.

So P2 is P1 multiplied by (5/7)^3.

So P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ 0.364 * P1.

Wait, that would mean that the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.364 times that of planet 1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So that would be P2 / P1.

Wait, wait, no: the question says, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?" So the ratio is (P2)/(P1).

From our calculation, P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Which is about 0.36 times. That's option A.

Wait, but wait again. Did I get the ratio right? Because if K is higher, that means the star is moving more, which suggests a larger planet or shorter period.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K. A higher K means the star is moving faster in its orbit. So for a given planet mass, a higher K could imply a shorter period because the star has to orbit more quickly.

Wait, going back to the formula: K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). So if K is larger, then P must be smaller.

So in our problem, K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5). So P2 is smaller than P1.

So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Which would make P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, not longer.

But the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. Oh wait, that's (P2)/(P1) → which is 0.36, so about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter, so the period is shorter by a factor of ~0.36. But the options have A as ~0.36, which would be the ratio P2/P1.

Wait, but let me make sure about the question. The question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if it's 0.36 times as long, then it's not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I got K1 and K2 the wrong way. Let me go back.

The problem states: planet #1 detected from a 5 milliangstrom shift. Planet #2 has a 7 milliangstrom shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

In the formula, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to (1/K^3).

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Which is (5/7)^3 P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So the period of planet #2 is shorter, about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

So the question is asking for P2 / P1 → 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer is option A.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets have similar masses to Neptune and their host stars have the same mass as the Sun. The key data provided are the Doppler shifts of the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2. These shifts are proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which is related to the orbital period \( P \) through the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From this relationship, the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of \( K \). Since \( K_2 > K_1 \) (7 vs. 5 milliangstroms), planet #2's orbital period \( P_2 \) will be shorter than planet #1's orbital period \( P_1 \). The ratio of the periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. However, the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( P_2 < P_1 \), planet #2's orbital period is not longer but shorter. The ratio \( P_2 / P_1 \) directly gives the factor by which \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), which is approximately 0.36.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
