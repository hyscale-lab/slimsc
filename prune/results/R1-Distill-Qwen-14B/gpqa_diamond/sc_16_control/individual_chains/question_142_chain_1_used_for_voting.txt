Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I need to figure out its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, but this looks like a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors multiplied by 1/2. So it's a completely mixed state or maximally mixed state maybe?

Let me write out the matrix form. The standard basis for qubits is |0⟩ and |1⟩. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh right, I think qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the density matrix's representation is a bit different. The Bloch sphere is for pure states, but for mixed states, perhaps we're talking about the representation in terms of the Bloch vector or something else.

Alternatively, I might be mixing concepts. Let me think. The density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r · σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (x,y,z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r corresponds to the Bloch vector, and for a pure state, its length is 1, but for a mixed state, the length is less than 1.

So let's express ρ in terms of I and the Pauli matrices. I know that I is the 2x2 identity matrix. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

Let me write ρ as (I + aσx + bσy + cσz)/2. Then, expanding this, I get:

(1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + (a/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] + (b/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]] + (c/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding all the components, the resulting matrix would have:

Top-left element: 1/2 + c/2
Top-right element: a/2 + (b*(-i))/2
Bottom-left: a/2 + (b*i)/2
Bottom-right: 1/2 - c/2

But our given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So let me set up equations by matching the elements.

From the top-left element:
1/2 + c/2 = 1/2 → c/2 = 0 → c=0.

Top-right element:
a/2 + (-i b)/2 = 0. So a - i b = 0 → a = i b.

Similarly, bottom-left element is a/2 + (i b)/2 = (a + i b)/2. For this to be zero, since a = i b, substitute: (i b + i b)/2 = (2i b)/2 = i b = 0. So i b =0 → b=0. Then a = i * 0 = 0.

So our r vector is (a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0). Wait, but wait, in the expression ρ = (I + r · σ)/2, r is a vector with components (x, y, z), and the dot product is x σx + y σy + z σz. So in this case, since a=0, b=0, c=0, the vector r is (0,0,0). 

So the geometrical position is at the origin. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the general form of a single-qubit density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + z & x - iy \\ x + iy & 1 - z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the given \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \), we match the elements to the general form. The diagonal elements give:

\[
1 + z = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 0,
\]
\[
1 - z = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 0.
\]

The off-diagonal elements give:

\[
x - iy = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 0, \, y = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in qubit space. Among the options, this corresponds to \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
