Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, let me start by understanding the question.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, Ay, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then determine which statement among the options A to D is correct.

Wait, okay, let's break this down. First, I should probably write down the matrix S and then compute Ay.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay is c multiplied by S. Since c is h/(4π), let me substitute that in. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [0   -i; i   0].

Hmm, actually, wait, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices (like S here) are usually represented with certain constants. Let me think: The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are 2x2 matrices. Oh, but in the problem, S is given as the matrix:

Row 1: 0 -i
Row 2: i 0

Wait, wait a second. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Yes, that's correct. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy. So Ay = c * σy, where c = h/(4π).

But wait, in standard terms, the angular momentum operator components are often written as (ħ/2)σ for spin-½ particles. Because the spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2)σ. So for a spin-½ particle, the components would be Sx = ħ/2 σx, and similar for Sy and Sz.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is given as c·S, and c is h/(4π). Let me check the units. Planck's constant h has units of J·s, and when you divide by 4π, that's still J·s/(4π). But wait, for spin-½ particles, the spin matrices are multiplied by ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). So ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 = h/(4π). Oh! Oh wait, because c is h/(4π), which equals ħ/2. So, c = ħ/2.

So that means Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. So, this is the standard form for the Y-component of the spin angular momentum operator for a spin-½ particle.

Now, the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. Wait, no, wait: the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by something. Wait, let's think about the eigenvalues of σy.

The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz each have eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when we have a matrix like (ħ/2) σy, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2. But wait, ħ is h/(2π), so substituting that in, we have ± (h/(2π)) / 2 = ± h/(4π). Wait, because ħ = h/(2π), so (ħ/2) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but let me compute this again. σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues become c * 1 and c * (-1), which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h, which seems way too big. Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues here are real? No, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are actually ±i, not ±1. Or is that right? Wait, no, let me think again. The Pauli matrices: σx, σy, σz each have trace zero, determinant -1. Let me compute the eigenvalues of σy.

To find the eigenvalues, we can solve for det(σy - λ I) = 0.

σy is:
[0  -i]
[i  0]

So the matrix for σy - λ I is:
[-λ   -i]
[i    -λ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - (i)(-i) = λ^2 - (i^2)(-1) ? Wait, wait, determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i)(i) = λ² - [ (−i)(i) ].

Wait, (−i)(i) is (−i²)= −(−1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - (1) = 0. So λ² =1 → λ= ±1. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Wait, but wait, when you have σy, the eigenvalues are ±1, not ±i. Hmm, that contradicts what I thought earlier. So that means my earlier assumption was wrong. Hmm.

Wait, let me make sure. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Yes, that's correct. So σx, σy, σz each have eigenvalues ±1. So their eigenvalues are real. So, in that case, for the operator Ay = c σy, the eigenvalues are c times ±1. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. So, when looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh or –2πh, real parts ±h/4π. But the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part should be zero. So this option can't be correct. So A is wrong.

Option B: The statement claims that the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But our eigenvalues are real, so imaginary part is zero. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since Ay is part of the angular momentum, and for a spin-½ system, A² should have eigenvalues (ħ^2)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² = ( (h/(4π)) )^2 ( ½ (½+1) ) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So all eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A² because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenvector of A². So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But it also says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az, because the angular momentum components don't commute. So, for example, if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in C is correct. So C could be the correct option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but I'm not sure what the question is implying here. The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two, which together form a basis. So, yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D might be correct. But wait, what's the exact statement? It says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Well, any set of eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix would form a basis for the space, so yes. So D could be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So the first part is correct because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity, so any vector is an eigenvector. The second part is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay aren't eigenfunctions of Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ A something, so they don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of Ay. Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it's acting on a two-dimensional space. Its eigenfunctions are two linearly independent vectors, which form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D would be correct as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. That's correct because any operator's eigenvectors form a basis if they are complete and independent. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options again.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Since A² is a scalar multiple of the identity, any vector is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part is correct. The second part is correct because, as the angular momentum components don't commute, a state can't be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space, so D is correct.

Wait, but wait, the options are presented such that only one is correct. Hmm. Because the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the eigenvalues.

Wait, the operator Ay is c times σy, where c = h/(4π). The eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c * (±1) = ± c = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So options A and B are incorrect because they talk about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts.

So which leaves options C and D. Now, considering the statements.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenvectors of A², but not of Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-½, A² has eigenvalues ( (h/(4π)) )^2 * (3/4) ), because s(s+1) for s=1/2 is (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4. Wait, wait, let me compute A² correctly.

Wait, the operator A (assuming it's the total angular momentum) would have A² = (ħ)^2 s(s+1), but in our case, Ay is only the Y-component. So for the operator Ay, which is part of the angular momentum, A² would be the sum of the squares of Ax, Ay, Az. But each of these is (ħ/2)^2 for spin-½. Wait, but in this problem, we're dealing with only Ay. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute A². But wait, in this problem, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So the total angular momentum operator A is given by A = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. So A² would be (ħ/2)^2 (σ·σ) = (ħ^2/4) (3 I), since σ·σ = σx² + σy² + σz² = 3 I for 2x2 matrices. So A² = (3 ħ² /4) I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue 3 ħ^2 /4.

Therefore, any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A², because A² is just a multiple of the identity matrix. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since the angular momentum components do not commute, this is correct.

So option C's statement is correct.

Then option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so yes. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct. So both C and D seem correct. But looking at the options again, perhaps one of them is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine option D. It says, "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, but the basis functions are the eigenvectors that form a basis, which is correct, but the statement is a bit ambiguous. Because the matrix operator is 2x2, and its eigenvectors (if they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So it's correct that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (eigenvectors). So option D is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option C and D could both be correct. But the question presents them as separate options. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option C.

Wait, let me think again. Does the eigenfunction of Ay being an eigenfunction of A² necessarily hold? Since A² is the square of the total angular momentum, but in our case, are we considering A² as the square of the total angular momentum, or just the square of Ay?

Wait, the problem says "the eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2". Wait, A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator, which is the sum of squares of all components. So, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2 because A² is a scalar multiple of identity. So yes, option C is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me double-check the matrix for Ay.

Ay = c S = c [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Let me compute the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues are the solutions to det( Ay - a I ) = 0.

So,

| -a       c (-i) |
| c i      -a     |

The determinant is a^2 - (c (-i))(c i) = a^2 - [ (-i)(i) c^2 ].

Wait, compute (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a^2 - c^2 =0 → a^2 = c^2 → a= ±c.

So eigenvalues are ±c. Since c = h/(4π), eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, as I thought earlier.

So eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are wrong.

Now, for the eigenvectors, let's find them.

For a = c = h/(4π):

The equation (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

So,

[ -a    -i c ]
[ i c   -a ]

Let me substitute a = c. So,

[ -c    -i c ]
[ i c   -c ]

Which simplifies to:

Row 1: -c (1) + (-i c) φ2 = 0 → -c (φ1 + i φ2 ) =0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T. Let's normalize it. So φ = [ -i, 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor. The normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |(-i)|^2 + |1|^2 ) → 1/sqrt(1+1) = 1/sqrt(2). So normalized φ is [ -i/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c, the eigenvector will be [ i, 1 ]^T, normalized.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. Because A² is a multiple of the identity, so any vector is an eigenstate. The second part is also correct because Az and Ay don't commute, so a state can't be an eigenstate of both.

Option D is correct because the eigenvectors are a basis for the 2x2 space.

Wait, but the options are presented as A, B, C, D. So, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option D. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. The matrix being 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so the statement is correct. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps all four options are presented, but only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

The eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong. Now, for option C and D.

C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix.

So, are C and D both correct?

But the question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are presented as individual options, so only one of them is correct. So I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct option is C. Wait, let me think.

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenfunctions and see what options they match.

The eigenfunctions have the form [ -i, 1 ]^T and [ i, 1 ]^T. Let's see, perhaps they are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, as I thought. And they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is probably only expecting one correct option. Hmm. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about option D. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and it has two eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) that are linearly independent, they form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question might be trying to test the concept of the basis being formed by the eigenfunctions, which is correct. So both C and D could be correct. But that's not possible if the options are exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, but the matrix is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenvectors span the space, thus they form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, option C is more about the properties of the eigenfunctions, which would be correct. Let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Only one is correct. So perhaps only C is correct. Because D is also correct, but perhaps the question states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. That is, the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, which is correct, but the statement in D is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me recap:

Eigenvalues: ± h/(4π) (so options A and B are incorrect).

Option C: eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² (correct) and not of Az (correct).

Option D: eigenfunctions form the basis of the operator (correct).

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct one is C.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is option C. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Wait, the basis functions are the eigenvectors, yes. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question's options allow for only one correct answer. Let me think, perhaps the correct answer is C. So the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So in that case, I'll go with option C being correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, so any statement claiming nonzero imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

2. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real, not complex.

3. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Option C:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). 
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle. Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). 
   - \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenfunction of \( A_z \). This statement is correct.

5. **Option D:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). 
   - Since \( A_y \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis for the two-dimensional space. This statement is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct "during the calculation," which strongly suggests selecting the most relevant or insightful statement. Option C is more directly tied to the properties of angular momentum operators and their eigenfunctions, making it the best choice.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
