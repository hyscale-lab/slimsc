Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and the speed at which it's moving. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ). But wait, how do I find the lifetime from the given parameters?

I think I should start by finding the lifetime τ of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Another thought: the mean lifetime τ is related to the total decay width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is the same as the inverse of the lifetime in natural units where ħ=1. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. Let me get the units straight. The width Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ, which is in units of GeV·s or something similar.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Hmm, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s, but when converted to eV·s, it's about 6.626e-34 / (1.602e-19) ≈ 4.135e-15 eV·s. Wait, but wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So converting that to GeV·s, since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (2π) ≈ 1.66e-35 J·s? Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me look for a quick way to remember the value of ħ in GeV·s.

Wait, I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's the lifetime. Then, the decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. But what's the speed of the meson X?

The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV. Its rest mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much larger than the rest mass, so it's moving relativistically. I need to find the velocity beta (β = v/c) and the Lorentz factor gamma.

The energy E of a particle is given by E = γ m c². Since c² is in units where it's 1 (in GeV and such, but I'm not sure), so E = γ m. So, γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So γ = 6.6667.

Then, the velocity beta is given by β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). So let's compute that. γ is 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking square root, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887c.

So the speed is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. So, approximately, v ≈ 0.9887 * c, where c is about 3e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay length L is v * τ. So, let's compute that.

First, τ is about 2.056875e-24 seconds. v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = Let me calculate that.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24. 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ about 6.1 (exact: 2.966 * 2.056 is roughly 6.1). Then 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So approximately 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately. 

Calculating 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24:

= (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24

= (about 6.102) * 1e-16.

So approximately 6.102e-16 meters. But wait, none of the options are close to 6e-16. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, none match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma? Let me recheck.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So gamma is E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667. Correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/(400/9)) )= sqrt(1 -9/400)= sqrt(391/400)=sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated tau. Let me compute tau more precisely.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's see: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4. So 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 20 + (0.182 / 0.32) ≈ 20.56875. So 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 seconds = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

So then v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's compute:

2.966 * 2.056875

= 2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1687

Total ≈5.932 + 0.1687 = 6.1007.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

Hmm, but options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should calculate beta gamma, which is v times gamma.

Wait, because when you have a particle moving at high speed, the decay length is (beta gamma c) * tau. Hmm, wait, I think that's another way to look at it.

Wait, let me think again: the lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by gamma, so tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

And the speed is beta c.

So the decay length L = beta c * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau_rest.

But tau_rest is ħ / (m_X * Γ) ? Wait, no, tau_rest is the proper lifetime, which is tau = ħ / (m_X * Γ) ?

Wait, no, the width is Γ, which is the decay width. Hmm, perhaps I should be considering that the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime via tau = ħ / (m_X Γ). Wait, no, previously I thought Γ is the total decay width, so tau is ħ / (Γ). But wait, because Γ has units of GeV, which is energy. So perhaps yes, the formula is tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, the lifetime tau is 1/(Γ) when Γ is in GeV. So, yes, in seconds, it's (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056e-24 s.

So, perhaps I did that correctly. But then why the decay length is coming as 6e-16, but no option is near that.

Wait, let me look at the options again. The closest is option A: 5.0223e-16 m and option D:4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, but 5e-16 is about 0.83 times my calculated 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in gamma or in beta.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy used is not the total energy but the kinetic energy. Oh wait, wait— no, the energy given is production energy, which is the total energy. So E_X includes rest mass. So no, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate beta more accurately.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (9/400) = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute that more accurately.

Well, 0.9775 is 1 - 0.0225.

So, sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - (0.0225)/(2*1) = 0.98875. Hmm, but more precisely, using a calculator, sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = (0.9887)^2:

= (0.98 * 1000 + 0.0087*1000)^2 in terms of 0.9887 = 9887/10000.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.9887^2:

= 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

≈ (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

= 0.9604 + 0.017208 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017208 = 0.977608 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97768369.

But our target is 0.9775. So 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.97768, which is a bit larger than 0.9775. So perhaps the actual beta is a bit less than 0.9887. Let me find beta more accurately.

We have beta^2 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's compute it accurately.

I can use the Newton-Raphson method for square roots. Let me take an initial guess of 0.9887, since we know 0.9887^2 is 0.97768369.

We want x such that x^2 = 0.9775. Let me compute f(x)=x² -0.9775.

f(0.9887) = 0.97768369 -0.9775=0.00018369.

f'(x)=2x. At x=0.9887, f'(x)=1.9774.

Next approximation: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 0.9887 - (0.00018369)/1.9774 ≈ 0.9887 - 0.0000929 ≈ 0.988607.

Compute (0.988607)^2:

= (0.9886)^2.

= 0.9886 * 0.9886.

Let me compute:

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0086 = 0.008428.

0.0086 * 0.98 = 0.008428.

0.0086 * 0.0086 ≈ 0.00007396.

Adding up:

0.9604 + (0.008428 + 0.008428) + 0.00007396 = 0.9604 + 0.016856 + 0.00007396 ≈ 0.97732996.

Which is 0.97733, which is a bit lower than 0.9775. So f(x1)=0.97733 -0.9775 = -0.00017.

Wait, but this isn't making sense. Wait, 0.988607^2 is approximately 0.97733, which is less than 0.9775. So the next correction would bring x a bit higher.

Wait, let me compute f(x1) = x1² - 0.9775 = 0.97733 -0.9775= -0.00017.

f'(x1) = 2 * 0.988607 ≈ 1.977214.

So next step: x2 =x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1) = 0.988607 - (-0.00017)/1.977214 ≈ 0.988607 + 0.0000859 ≈ 0.988693.

Compute x2² = (0.988693)^2.

≈ (0.988693)^2.

Well, perhaps an exact calculation would take too long, but perhaps it's approximately 0.9775.

So the better approximation is beta ≈ 0.988693.

So beta is approximately 0.988693.

So v ≈ 0.988693 * c.

c is 3e8 m/s, so v ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So, now, L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Computing 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24:

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.102, as before.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same result of 6.1e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of tau.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = let me calculate that.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182.

0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582.

Yes, so 20.56875 * 0.32 = 6.582.

So, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps my initial approach is correct, but the options don't match. So maybe I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the width is given as Γ, but perhaps the formula uses the total width differently.

Wait, another approach: The mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / (m_X Γ), but wait, no, because Γ is the width, which is (m_X times the decay rate?), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime tau by Γ= ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Yes, that's correct. So no mistake there.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the velocity factor as gamma multiplied by beta?

Wait, another thought: The decay length formula is L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau_0.

Wait, tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_rest = ħ / (m_X * Γ), but wait, no. Wait, no, the proper lifetime tau_0 is the same as the tau I calculated, because tau_0 = ħ / (m_X Γ) ?

Wait, wait, no. Because the width Γ is the same as the decay rate times ħ. So, the decay rate Γ (which is the width) is equal to ħ times the decay constant (1/tau_0). So, Γ = ħ / tau_0 → tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

So, tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_rest. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma * (ħ / Γ).

So, L = v * tau = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

Wait, that's a different way to write it.

So, v = beta c, tau = gamma tau_0 = gamma (ħ/Γ).

So, L = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

But beta gamma is (v/(c)) * gamma.

So, let's compute that:

beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma = (gamma beta).

So, L = (beta gamma c) * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, let me compute beta gamma:

gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

beta is approximately 0.988693.

So, beta * gamma = 6.6667 * 0.988693 ≈6.6667 *0.9887 ≈ let's compute:

6 *0.9887 is 5.9322.

0.6667 *0.9887 ≈0.6667 *0.98 = 0.6534, and 0.6667 *0.0087≈0.0058, so total ≈0.6592.

Adding 5.9322 +0.6592≈6.5914.

So, beta gamma ≈6.5914.

So, L = beta gamma c (ħ/Γ).

Wait, but ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s, and Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So, (ħ/Γ) is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = (6.5914) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Compute the product:

First, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma: 6.5914 * 6.170625e-16.

6.5914 *6.170625 is approximately: 6 *6=36, 0.5914*6=3.548, 6 *0.1706=1.0236, 0.5914 *0.1706≈0.1008. Let me compute more accurately:

6.5914 *6.170625 ≈ (6.5 *6.170625) + (0.0914 *6.170625).

6.5 *6.170625 = 40.1080625.

0.0914 *6.170625 ≈0.0914 *6=0.5484, 0.0914 *0.170625≈0.01558. So total≈0.5484 +0.01558≈0.56398.

So total approx 40.108 +0.564 =40.672.

So, 6.5914 *6.170625e-16 =40.672e-16 m =4.0672e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.067e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m) or option C (5.0223e-15 m). Wait, this is 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using beta and gamma separately, I got 6.1e-16 m, but now with beta gamma, I get 4.067e-15 m.

Wait, so where did I go wrong in my initial approach? Oh, because when I took v * tau, I used tau as gamma tau_0, which is correct. But in my first approach, I computed tau as ħ / Γ, which is correct, and v as beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But in my first calculation, I used tau = gamma tau_0, which is correct, but I think I messed up the calculation in my head.

Wait, wait, in my first approach, I had:

tau = gamma tau_0 = gamma (ħ / Γ).

v = beta c.

So L = v * tau = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

Which is what I did in the second approach. So that gives L = beta gamma c (ħ / Γ) = 6.5914 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, but 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma (≈6.5914) gives 6.5914 * 6.170625e-16 ≈40.67e-16 m =4.067e-15 m.

Which matches with option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, in my initial approach I had L = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s)*(2.056875e-24 s) =6.102e-16 m.

Ah, I see the mistake! Oh no, in the first approach, I forgot to multiply by gamma again. Because tau is gamma tau_0, which is correct, but in the first calculation, I think I used tau = tau_0, which is wrong.

Wait, no. Let me double-check.

In the first approach, I calculated tau as ħ / Γ, which is correct. But in reality, tau is the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau_0, which is ħ/Γ. So tau = gamma * tau_0 = gamma * (ħ/Γ).

So in the first approach, I thought tau was ħ/Γ, which is tau_0, but in reality, tau is gamma multiplied by that. Because the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. So in my first approach, I used tau_0 instead of tau, so I forgot to multiply by gamma again.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

The proper lifetime tau_0 is ħ / Γ. The lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. So in the first approach, I correctly calculated tau as gamma * (ħ/Γ), which is correct.

Wait, but in the first calculation, I used tau = ħ/Γ = 2.056875e-24 s. But that is tau_0, the proper lifetime. So in the lab frame, tau is gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Wait no, wait, tau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s, and tau = gamma * tau_0 = (8/1.2) * 2.056875e-24 = (6.6667) * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.371e-23 s.

But wait, that would make L = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.371e-23 s) = approximately 4.066e-15 m.

Which brings me to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So why did I get confused earlier?

Because in the first approach, I mistakenly used tau_0 (2.056e-24 s) instead of tau (1.37e-23 s). So that's where I made the mistake.

So the correct L is approximately 4.066e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m).


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay length \( L \), the velocity \( v \), and the lifetime \( \tau \): 

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Relate \( \tau \) to the lab frame lifetime
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is the same as \( \tau \) in the rest frame of the particle. The lab frame lifetime \( \tau \) is dilated by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\tau = \gamma \cdot \tau_0
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

Thus, the lab frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \gamma \cdot \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined by the relativistic factor \( \beta = v/c \), where:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = 44.444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225, \quad \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta \cdot c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23})
\]

First, calculate the product:

\[
2.966 \cdot 1.371 \approx 4.067, \quad L = 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

ANSWER: B
