Okay, I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty ΔP_z for the given quantum system. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in the given state. Then I'll find ⟨P_z²⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z squared. Once I have both, I can plug them into the formula and find the uncertainty.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩. And the operator P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ) along the diagonal. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the matrix form of P_z is diagonal in this basis. So P_z is diagonal with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ].

Wait, looking again at the problem statement, the operator P_z's matrix is:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)
So yes, P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that each component corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z. So |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, which are the eigenvectors of P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, respectively.

Wait, actually, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the components of the state vector are in this basis. So the state is represented as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the probability of each state multiplied by its eigenvalue.

So let's compute the probabilities. The state has components a, b, c where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

The probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

Calculating each:
|a|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|c|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0? Wait, that's interesting. Because the a and c terms are (1/4 each) multiplied by ħ and -ħ respectively, so they cancel each other. The middle term is zero, so overall ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each entry squared. So the eigenvalues of P_z squared would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by these squared eigenvalues.

So that's (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ², and ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. So the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = 1/2 ħ².

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance: sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. The state components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Squared magnitudes are correct: 1/4, 1/2, 1/4.

So when calculating ⟨P_z⟩: 
(1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩: each term is (probability) * (eigenvalue squared).
So (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = 2*(1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

Then, uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). So that's option B, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the state components) and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
