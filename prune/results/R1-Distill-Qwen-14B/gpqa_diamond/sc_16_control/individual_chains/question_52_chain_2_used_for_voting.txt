Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and think through what's being asked.

Okay, the question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two different energy levels. The setup gives me some key data points. Let me jot them down.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. Observations show that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm. I recall that in stellar atmospheres, when a star has spots, these spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, the presence of spots affects the observed spectrum because the light from the spots is at a lower temperature. But how does this affect the ratio of atoms in different energy levels?

Wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). So each region emits according to its local temperature. But when there are spots, part of the surface is cooler, and part is at the original Teff.

But wait, the overall Teff given is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. Oh wait, no, the overall effective temperature decreases when spots are present. Wait, the question says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the model here is that the star's overall effective temperature changes when spots are present. Or wait, is the 5500 K the new Teff? Or is it the temperature of the spotted regions?

Hmm, perhaps the 5500 K is the effective temperature of the entire photosphere when 40% is covered. But that seems confusing because the presence of spots would lower the overall flux. Alternatively, perhaps the 5500 K is the temperature of the spotted regions, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K.

Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted. But that doesn't quite make sense because when part of the surface is cooler, the overall effective temperature would be somewhere between 6000 and the spot temperature. So perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature. But the question doesn't give the spot temperature, so maybe we can model it another way.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. The star's luminosity when spotted would be the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. So, when 40% is covered, 60% is at 6000 K, and 40% is at some lower temperature, say T_spot. The total flux is the sum of the flux from each region. Then the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.

So, the star's luminosity when spotted (L_spotted) is 5500^4 multiplied by 4πR² (since L = 4πR²σTeff^4), and when not spotted (L_unspotted) is 6000^4 times 4πR².

So, the change in luminosity is due to the spots. So, let me model that.

The star's surface area is 4πR². When 40% is spotted, the unspotted area is 0.6 * 4πR², and the spotted area is 0.4 *4πR². The flux from each part is F = σT^4. So the total flux when spotted is F_total = (unspotted area) * T_unspotted^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4.

Wait, but wait: when there are spots, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K. So the total luminosity is L = 4πR² σ (5500)^4.

Without spots, L0 = 4πR² σ (6000)^4.

So the difference in luminosity is due to the spots. Let me model it:

L_spotted = L_unspotted_portion + L_spotted_portion.

But wait, when spots are present, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% at T_spot.

So,

L_spotted = 0.6 * 4πR² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 *4πR² σ (T_spot)^4.

But L_spotted is also equal to 4πR² σ (5500)^4.

So,

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

Let me compute each part.

Let me compute 5500^4, 6000^4, and then find T_spot.

But perhaps using relative terms would be easier. Let me divide everything by (10^3 K)^4 = 10^12 K^4.

So, 5500 K is 5.5 *1e3, so (5.5)^4 = (5.5)^2 squared: 5.5^2 =30.25; 30.25^2 ≈ 915.06. So 5500^4 = (5.5)^4 *1e12 = 915.06 * 1e12.

Similarly, 6000^4 is (6)^4=1296, so 1296e12.

T_spot is x, so (x/1e3)^4 = (x/1e3)^4.

So, the equation:

0.6 * 1296e12 + 0.4 * (x/1e3)^4 *1e12 = 915.06e12.

Divide both sides by 1e12:

0.6 *1296 + 0.4 * (x/1e3)^4 = 915.06.

Compute 0.6 *1296 = 777.6.

So,

777.6 + 0.4*(x/1e3)^4 =915.06.

Subtract 777.6:

0.4*(x/1e3)^4 = 915.06 -777.6 = 137.46.

Divide by 0.4:

(x/1e3)^4 = 137.46 / 0.4 = 343.65.

Take the fourth root of 343.65.

Wait, 343 is 7^3, but 343.65 is approximately 343.65. Let's compute 343.65^(1/4).

Well, 4^4=256, 5^4=625. So it's between 4 and 5.

Compute 4.3^4: 4.3^2=18.49; 18.49^2 ≈ 341.88. Hmm, 341.88 is close to 343.65. So, 4.3^4 ≈ 341.88.

4.3 * 4.3 = 18.49. Then 18.49^2 is (approx 18^2=324, 18.49 * 18.49= 341.88.

So, 4.3^4 = ~341.88. Our target is 343.65, which is slightly higher.

What is 4.31^4?

Let's compute 4.31^2: (4.3)^2 is 18.49, plus 0.01*2*4.3 = 0.086, plus 0.01^2. So 18.49 + 0.086 = 18.576. So approx 18.576.

Then 18.576 squared: 18^2 = 324, 2*18 *0.576= 20.304, 0.576^2≈0.331. So total approx 324 +20.304 +0.331= 344.635.

Wait, 18.576 *18.576 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 4.31^4 = (4.31)^2 * (4.31)^2. So 4.31 squared is approximately (4.3)^2 + 2*4.3*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 18.49 + 0.086 + 0.0001 = 18.5761.

So (18.5761)^2 is 344.92 (since 18.5^2 is 342.25, and 0.0761^2 is negligible, but cross terms would add around 2*(18.5)*(0.0761)= ~2.83. So 342.25 + 2.83 = 345.08.)

So 4.31^4 ≈ 345.08, which is a bit higher than 343.65. So the actual x must be a little less than 4.31, say around 4.305.

But perhaps for approximation purposes, it's around 4.3.

So x/1e3 is approximately 4.3, so x = 4.3e3 K = 4300 K.

So the spots are at about 4300 K.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So the spotted regions are at 4300 K, and the unspotted parts are at 6000 K.

Now, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2, respectively.

In LTE, the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or far UV. So the energy difference between levels 1 and 2 is E = hc/λ.

Compute E = hc/λ. Let me recall h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s, and λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) = approximately 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but I can also compute this in terms of eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

E = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high for a photon at 1448 Å. Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, and the energy is hc/lambda = (1240 eV·nm)/144.8 nm ≈ 8.57 eV. Oh right, that's correct. So E = 8.57 eV. So the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's the difference E2 - E1. Let's assume level 2 is higher than level 1. So E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, it's -(E2 - E1)/(kT). So n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)).

So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive.

But in the problem, the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (since spots are cooler), the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. So that's consistent with the observation.

But the question is about the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_sp)) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_no) )

Wait, wait. Let me see: T_no is the temperature when there are no spots. So T_no = 6000 K. T_sp is the temperature when there are spots. But wait, wait, the problem is about the photosphere when the star has spots. However, the presence of spots makes part of the photosphere cooler and part hotter?

Wait, no, the spots are cooler. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K (unspotted) and 4300 K (spotted). But how does this affect the observed spectrum?

Wait, but the question is about the ratio in the stellar photosphere. So the ratio is measured in the overall photosphere. Hmm, but in reality, when spots are present, different parts of the photosphere have different temperatures. Therefore, the observed ratio would be a combination of the ratios from each region. But the problem says to assume LTE. So perhaps each region is at a different temperature, and the average ratio is some kind of weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, no, the effective temperature is the temperature that a blackbody with the same total flux would have. But the photosphere itself is a mix of hot and cool regions, each emitting according to their own temperature.

So the observed ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels would be a combination of the ratios from the 60% unspotted regions (6000 K) and the 40% spotted regions (4300 K). But the problem says to assume LTE, so each region has its own ratio.

Wait, but the problem presents a ratio that "decreases" when the star has spots. So perhaps the ratio is dominated by the cooler regions, or the way the fluxes combine leads to a lower ratio.

But wait, when you have a star with spots, the observed spectrum is a combination of the light from the hot and cool regions. So the equivalent ratio in the spectrum would be a flux-weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the ratio n1/n2 is a function of temperature, so each region contributes a certain ratio. But the flux from each region is proportional to the area times the Planck function at the given wavelength, which depends on temperature.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the problem.

The problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is by what factor.

Assuming that the photosphere is in LTE, each region (hot and cold) contributes to the observed spectrum. But the ratio observed is a combination of the ratios from each region, weighted by their contribution to the flux at the transition wavelength.

Wait, but the transition wavelength is 1448 Å. So the flux from each region at this wavelength is given by Planck's law: B_lambda(T) = (2 h c^2)/lambda^5 / (exp(h c/(lambda k T)) - 1 )

But the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels would be determined by the Boltzmann factor, because the number of atoms in each level depends exponentially on temperature.

But wait, in the photosphere, the number of atoms in each level depends on the local temperature. So in the unspotted regions (6000 K), the ratio is n1/n2(T=6000), and in the spotted regions (4300 K), it's n1/n2(T=4300).

The observed equivalent ratio would be a flux-weighted average of these two ratios because the flux from each region contributes to the overall spectrum.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the observed ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

But how does the presence of spots affect the observed ratio? The spots are cooler, so in their regions, n1/n2 is lower. The unspotted regions have higher n1/n2. So the observed ratio would be a weighted average between higher and lower values.

But if the majority of the flux comes from the unspotted regions, then the observed ratio when spots are present would be closer to the unspotted value. Alternatively, if the spots contribute a significant fraction of the flux, the observed ratio could be lower.

Wait, but in our case, 40% of the surface is covered by spots. But the flux contribution depends on the Planck function at the given wavelength (1448 Å). Let's compute the flux from each region at this wavelength.

Compute B_lambda for 6000 K and 4300 K at 1448 Å.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of flux contributions.

Compute the flux from each region:

Flux_unspotted = 0.6 * B(6000 K, 1448 Å)
Flux_spotted = 0.4 * B(4300 K, 1448 Å)

The total flux at this wavelength is Flux_total = Flux_unspotted + Flux_spotted.

The observed ratio would be a function of the flux from each region. Wait, but the number ratio n1/n2 is a function of temperature, and the flux from each region is a function of B_lambda.

But the question is about the ratio of n1/n2, not the flux. So perhaps the observed equivalent ratio is a flux-weighted average of the individual ratios.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because the transition in question is in the spectrum, and the observed equivalent width or line strength depends on the number of atoms in each level. So when the star has spots, the flux from the cooler regions (with lower n1/n2) is added to the flux from the hotter regions (with higher n1/n2). 

But the ratio we're considering is n1/n2, not the flux. So perhaps the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the ratio from each region.

Hmm. Alternatively, the problem may be oversimplified, and the effective temperature is 5500 K when the star has spots. So perhaps the question is considering the entire photosphere to be at 5500 K when the star has spots, which would mean that the effective temperature for the ratio is 5500 K.

Wait, but in reality, the star is not isothermal. So perhaps the correct approach is that when the star has spots, the area is a mix of 6000 K and 4300 K, and each region contributes to the line formation according to its own temperature and its flux contribution.

But the problem statement says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K, and for line formation, we can take T=5500 K. But that would be an approximation.

Wait, but the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the UV. So the star's continuum at that wavelength would be dominated by regions where the temperature allows significant emission at that wavelength.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure I have enough information about the exact line formation process. Let me think again about the problem.

The question is about the factor by which the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star is without spots versus with spots.

When the star has no spots, the photosphere is at 6000 K. So each atom is in LTE at 6000 K, and the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

When the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions' ratios.

Wait, but the number of atoms in each region is proportional to the area, right? Because each region has a certain area. So would it be an area-weighted average or a flux-weighted average?

Wait, I think it's a flux-weighted average because the flux from each region contributes to the observed line. So the observed ratio would be:

n1_over_n2_total = (Flux_unspotted * n1_unspotted/n2_unspotted + Flux_spotted * n1_spotted/n2_spotted ) / (Flux_unspotted + Flux_spotted )

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is a simple average based on the area, but that might not account for the different flux contributions.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in each level is determined by the local temperature. So in the unspotted regions, it's higher (n1/n2 = R_high), and in the spotted regions, it's lower (R_low). The observed equivalent ratio would be a flux-weighted average of R_high and R_low.

So, the total flux is F_total = F_high + F_low,

where F_high = 0.6 * B(6000, 1448 Å)
F_low = 0.4 * B(4300, 1448 Å)

The observed ratio R_obs = (F_high * R_high + F_low * R_low) / F_total.

But R_high = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )
R_low = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k * 4300) )

So R_obs = [ F_high * exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000)) + F_low * exp(-ΔE/(k * 4300)) ] / (F_high + F_low )

But in the no-spot case, the temperature is 6000 K, so R_no_spots = R_high.

When there are spots, R_with_spots = R_obs as above.

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = R_high / R_obs.

Hmm. Let me compute R_obs.

But first, let's compute F_high and F_low.

Compute B_lambda at 1448 Å for T=6000 K and T=4300 K.

The Planck function is B_lambda(T) = (2h c^2)/(lambda^5) / [exp( h c/(lambda k T) ) - 1 ]

But calculating this for two different temperatures and a given wavelength would give the flux from each region.

But let me compute the ratio F_high/F_low.

F_high = 0.6 * B(6000)
F_low = 0.4 * B(4300)

So F_high / F_low = (0.6 / 0.4) * [ B(6000) / B(4300) ]

But I need to compute B(6000)/B(4300) at 1448 Å.

Let me compute the exponents.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
k = 1.38e-23 J/K
lambda = 1448e-10 m.

Compute x_high = h c / (lambda k T_high) where T_high=6000 K.

x_high = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 * 6000 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Denominator: 1448e-10 m *1.38e-23 J/K *6000 K = 1448e-10 *1.38e-23 *6e3 = 1448 *1.38 *6e3 * 1e-33

Calculate 1448 *1.38 ≈ 1448 *1.38 ≈ 1448 *1=1448, 1448 *0.38≈549. So total ≈ 1448 +549 = 1997.

Multiply by 6e3: 1997 *6e3 = approx 11,982,000.

Multiply by 1e-33: 11,982,000e-33 = 1.1982e-26.

So denominator is 1.1982e-26.

So x_high = 1.9878e-25 / 1.1982e-26 ≈ approx 16.6.

Similarly, for T_low=4300 K:

x_low = h c / (lambda k T_low) = same numerator, denominator with T=4300.

Denominator: 1448e-10 *1.38e-23 *4300 = 1448 *1.38 *4300 *1e-33.

Compute 1448 *1.38 ≈ 1997 as before. 1997 *4300 ≈ 1997 *4e3=7,988,000; 1997 *300=599,100 → total approx 8,587,100.

Multiply by 1e-33: 8.5871e-27.

x_low=1.9878e-25 /8.5871e-27 ≈ approx 23.16.

So now, compute B(6000)/B(4300) = [ (exp(x_high) -1 ) / (exp(x_low) -1 ) ]^(-1) ?

Wait, no. B_lambda(T) is proportional to 1/(exp(x) -1 ), right?

So,

B(6000) = (2h c^2)/(lambda^5) * 1/(exp(x_high) -1 )

B(4300) = (2h c^2)/(lambda^5) * 1/(exp(x_low) -1 )

So the ratio B(6000)/B(4300) is [ (1/(exp(x_high)-1 )) ] / [ (1/(exp(x_low) -1 )) ] = (exp(x_low) -1 )/(exp(x_high) -1 )

So,

x_high ≈16.6 → exp(16.6) is a huge number. exp(16) is about 8.88e6, exp(16.6)= about 9.3e6 (exact number not crucial here since it might dominate the denominator).

Similarly, x_low≈23.16 → exp(23.16) is about 1e10.

Wait, let me compute these exponents.

exp(16.6) ≈ e^16.6 ≈ e^16 * e^0.6.

e^16 ≈ 8,886,110. So e^0.6≈1.822. So 8.886e6 *1.822≈1.62e7.

exp(16.6) ≈1.62e7.

So exp(x_high) -1 ≈1.62e7.

exp(x_low)=exp(23.16)= e^23 * e^0.16.

e^23≈9.8e9. e^0.16≈1.1735. So 9.8e9 *1.1735≈1.15e10.

exp(x_low) -1 ≈1.15e10.

So,

B(6000)/B(4300) = (exp(x_low)-1)/(exp(x_high)-1) ≈ (1.15e10)/(1.62e7)≈710.49.

So,

F_high / F_low = (0.6 /0.4) * (710.49) ≈ (1.5) *710.49≈1065.74.

So F_high is about 1065 times larger than F_low.

So, when calculating R_obs,

R_obs = [ F_high * R_high + F_low * R_low ] / (F_high + F_low )

But since F_high >> F_low, F_low can be neglected. So R_obs ≈ R_high.

But wait, that's not possible because when spots are present, the ratio R_obs is lower than R_high. But according to this calculation, F_high is much larger than F_low, so R_obs would be approximately R_high, which would mean that the ratio doesn't change much. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So this would imply that my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating F_high and F_low. Because in reality, the flux is the amount of energy emitted per unit area per wavelength. So when you have a star with 40% area at a lower temperature, the flux contribution from the lower temperature region may not be negligible, especially at certain wavelengths.

Wait, but at 1448 Å, which is in the UV, the contribution from cooler regions might be lower. Because at lower temperatures, the blackbody curve peaks at longer wavelengths. So the flux at 1448 Å would be lower for cooler regions.

So, perhaps F_high is much larger than F_low, making F_low negligible. But that would imply that adding spots doesn't change the observed ratio much, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is oversimplified, and the ratio is only considered at the effective temperature, 5500 K when spots are present. So the ratio when spotted is at 5500 K, and when not spotted, it's at 6000 K.

So the factor would be (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Let me compute this.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the factor is [ exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/5500 - 1/6000] )

Compute the exponent:

ΔE is 8.57 eV.

Convert ΔE to J: 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

Compute [1/5500 - 1/6000] = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) )= approx 1.515e-5.

So,

exponent = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * 1.515e-5 (1/K)

= (1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ) * 1.515e-5

Compute 1.373e-18 /1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4 ≈ 1e5.

Multiply by 1.515e-5: 1e5 *1.515e-5 ≈ 1.515.

So the exponent is approximately 1.515.

Thus, the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ 4.54.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from no spots to having spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R = 1.5 R_\odot \)
   - Mass: \( M = 1.1 M_\odot \)
   - Effective temperature without spots: \( T_{\text{eff, no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - Effective temperature with 40% surface covered by spots: \( T_{\text{eff, spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Energy Levels**:
   - Transition wavelength: \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)
   - Energy difference: \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)
     - \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}, \, c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, \, \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
     - \( \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \)
     - Convert to eV: \( \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV} \)

3. **Boltzmann Equation**:
   The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
   \]
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and \( T \) is the temperature.

4. **Factor of Change**:
   The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{eff, spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{eff, no spots}}}\right)\right)
   \]

### Calculation:
1. **Temperature Difference Term**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_{\text{eff, spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{eff, no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33 \times 10^6} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
   \]

2. **Exponent**:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{eff, spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{eff, no spots}}}\right) = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   - Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \)
   - Multiply by \( 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \): \( 9.95 \times 10^4 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.515 \)

3. **Factor**:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.54
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**.
