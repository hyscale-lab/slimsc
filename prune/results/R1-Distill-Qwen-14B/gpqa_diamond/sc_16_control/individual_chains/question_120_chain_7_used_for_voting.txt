Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star from us. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax, so d = 1/p. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us because it's moving more as we orbit.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant. So, for a given volume, the number of stars is the same everywhere. Wait, but here we're looking at how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with p. So I need to relate the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d to the change in parallax.

Let me think about a thin spherical shell at a distance d. The volume of such a shell would be the surface area multiplied by the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and if the shell's thickness is dd, then the volume is 4πd² dd. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume. So N_shell = n * 4πd² dd, where n is a constant number density.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax (plx) range. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me change variables from d to p. So, how does d relate to p? If p increases, d decreases because they're inversely related.

So, substituting d = 1/p into the equation for the number of stars in the shell: N_shell = n * 4π (1/p)² * dd. But I need to express this in terms of parallax p and the change in p, dp. So, I should find how dd relates to dp.

Since d = 1/p, taking the derivative with respect to p gives dd/dp = -1/(p²). So, dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're dealing with ranges, maybe the negative sign can be ignored because we're considering the magnitude. So, dd ≈ 1/p² dp.

Substituting back into N_shell: N_shell = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would be (1/p^4) dp. So N_shell is proportional to 1/p^4 times dp. Or, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So per unit dp, the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So if you have a range dp, the count in that range is ~ (1/p^4) * dp.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that would be the case. So the number per unit parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the number per unit (dp) is N_shell/(dp) = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) ) = 4π n (1/p^4). So yes, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to p^4.

Wait, but another thought: when we look at the number of stars per unit volume, it's uniform. So the number in a volume element is proportional to the volume. The volume element in terms of p would involve how the volume changes with p.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number density. The number density n is stars per unit volume. The volume element in terms of p is a thin shell. So, the number of stars within a parallax range from p to p+dp would be n multiplied by the volume of that shell. The shell's volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp? Wait, no, earlier I thought the volume was 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then d squared is 1/p². And dd is the change in d, which is 1/p² dp. So volume is 4π (1/p²) (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So per unit dp, it's n *4π (1/p^4) stars. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Which brings me back to the same conclusion. So option A is correct.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) as \( p = 1/d \). The problem assumes stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density \( n \) (stars per unit volume) is constant.

Consider a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), and the number of stars in the shell is proportional to this volume:  
\[
N_{\text{shell}} = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]

Since \( d = 1/p \), we can rewrite \( d^2 \) as \( (1/p)^2 \). Additionally, \( dd \) can be expressed in terms of \( dp \) using the relation \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (ignoring the negative sign as we are interested in magnitudes). Substituting these into the expression for \( N_{\text{shell}} \), we get:  
\[
N_{\text{shell}} = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( dp \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means the number of stars decreases with the fourth power of parallax.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
