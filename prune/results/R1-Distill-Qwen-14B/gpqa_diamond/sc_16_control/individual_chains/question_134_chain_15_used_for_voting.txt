Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait a second—Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And both HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So when they react, it's an acid-base neutralization reaction, which typically releases heat because it's exothermic.

The first thing I remember is that enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of acid reacting with a base. But wait, the problem has three solutions here. So I need to find out how much each acid contributes and how much each reacts with the base.

Wait, but wait—H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. That means each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So when it reacts with a base, it can donate two protons. But Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So the reaction would be something like acid + base → salt + water.

Let me write down the moles of each substance. The volumes and molarities are given.

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.1 moles.

But wait, since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole can provide 2 H+ ions. So the H+ from HCl is 0.1 × 1 = 0.1 (since each HCl gives one H+). From H2SO4, it's 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 H+.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

But the base is Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, the reaction between acids and bases is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the neutralization depends on the available H+ and OH-.

So the H+ available is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.2 < 0.28.

So the reaction can only proceed to use up all the OH-.

Wait, but how much H+ would that consume? Each OH- reacts with one H+. So 0.2 moles of OH- would react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 comes into play. Let's see: which acid contributes the H+ first?

Wait, but in solution, all the H+ ions are available. So regardless of the source, the reaction is just H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So the neutralization would be 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ neutralized, right? Or wait, per mole of acid reacting. Hmm. No, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So each mole of H+ contributes to the enthalpy.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, and each mole releases a certain amount of energy. I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or sometimes expressed in kcal; 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ).

Wait, but wait, what's the standard value? I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of acid, given that strong monoprotic acids donate one H+ each). But wait, wait—H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, the first dissociation is complete, the second might not be 100%, but for strong acids, we assume complete dissociation.

Wait, but H2SO4 is considered a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait. Wait, no, sulfuric acid is a strong acid in the first dissociation: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (but the second H+ doesn't dissociate completely). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete, but the second is not. So in solution, the first H+ is completely released, but the second H+ comes from HSO4^- which is a weak acid.

So in the case of H2SO4, the first H+ is strong, so the initial dissociation is complete. The second H+ is not, but in a neutralization reaction with a strong base, the HSO4^- would likely deprotonate further, so H2SO4 would fully donate both H+ when reacting with a strong base like Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait, when you mix H2SO4 with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2H2O.

Wait, let's balance that equation. Ba(OH)2 is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In that reaction, each mole of H2SO4 consumes two moles of Ba(OH)2? Wait no, because each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-. So for each mole of H2SO4 and one mole of Ba(OH)2, the reaction would produce two H2O molecules.

So in this case, the mole ratio is 1:1 for H2SO4 to Ba(OH)2.

But wait, in the problem, the moles are 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2.

So, moles of H2SO4 is 0.09; Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, because 0.09 < 0.1.

Wait, because for each mole of H2SO4, you need one mole of Ba(OH)2. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 would need 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Since we have 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, there's enough for all the H2SO4 to react, and there's 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2 left.

Wait, but wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions. So each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+. So when they react, it's a 1:1 ratio of H2SO4 to Ba(OH)2. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 would require 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. But we have 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, so 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2 remains after H2SO4 has reacted completely.

But wait, what about the HCl? HCl is a strong acid, so it provides 0.1 moles H+.

So after H2SO4 is completely neutralized, any remaining OH- would react with HCl.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: HCl gives 0.1 moles H+, H2SO4 gives 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+ → total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the H+ in H2SO4 (both from first and second dissociations) would react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the neutralization reaction.

So when you mix all three solutions, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases heat.

The total H+ available is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is limiting, so 0.2 moles of H+ will be neutralized.

Thus, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles × enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but what's the standard enthalpy of neutralization? For strong acids and strong bases, it's approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or about -13.6 kcal/mol, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal).

Wait, but I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (so per mole of H+ neutralized). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, since it's exothermic, it's negative. So -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be approximately correct if the calculation was in kcal, but wait, our calculation is in kJ.

Wait, wait, I might have mixed the units. Let me check. The options are a mix of kJ and kcal.

Option D is -16.0 kJ. Other options are in kcal.

Wait, the calculation I did was 0.2 moles × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. So -11.4 kJ. So option D is -16.0, which is higher. Hmm. So none of the options directly match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of acid for strong monoprotic acids, because each mole gives one H+). But for H2SO4, because it's diprotic, each mole contributes two H+, so the neutralization would be -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me try that. So:

Each mole of HCl gives 1 H+, so its neutralization contributes -57 kJ.

Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so its neutralization contributes 2 × (-57) = -114 kJ per mole.

But in our case, we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4. So, it would contribute 0.09 × (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

HCl is 0.1 moles, contributing 0.1 × (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

Total would be -10.26 -5.7 = -15.96 kJ, which is approximately -16 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that seems to match.

Wait, but wait—this approach assumes that all the H+ from H2SO4 is neutralized. But in reality, when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, it's a 1:1 mole ratio. So maybe only some of the H2SO4's H+ is neutralized, and the rest reacts with the remaining OH- from the Ba(OH)2 and HCl.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately. Let's go back.

Total H+ available: HCl (0.1) + H2SO4 (0.09 × 2) = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- available: Ba(OH)2 (0.1 × 2) = 0.2.

So the neutralization would proceed as:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, none of the options match this exactly. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert 11.4 kJ to kcal.

Since 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal (because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 1 kJ = 1/(4.184) kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So 11.4 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the approach using per mole of acid gives -16 kJ, which is option D.

Hmm, conflicting conclusions. So which approach is correct?

I think the confusion comes from whether to consider each H+ as contributing to the enthalpy, or to handle the neutralization based on the limiting reagent.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So if 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, then it's 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, or about -2.72 kcal.

But option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this.

So why did I get a different answer earlier? Because when I considered per mole of H2SO4, I assumed all its H+ were neutralized, which isn't the case here because OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the correct approach is: find the moles of H+ and OH-, take the minimum as the amount that reacts, then multiply by the enthalpy per H+.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, leading to 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.4 kJ in kcal.

11.4 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.723 kcal. So approx -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if 2.723 kcal were multiplied by 4, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. Let me clarify:

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Converting that to kcal: -11.4 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if I have -11.4 kJ, that's -11.4 × (kcal per kJ) ?

Wait, no, because 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be option A.

But why is option B present as -11.42 kcal? Perhaps I missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ neutralized, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole in kcal.

Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.6).

So 0.2 moles × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.

Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the approach considering H2SO4 and HCl as separate acids and calculating their contributions based on moles would give a different result. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in treating the H+ from H2SO4 as available for neutralization. Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, only the first H+ is completely dissociated. The second H+ comes from HSO4^- which is a weak acid. So in a neutralization with a strong base, the first H+ would react, but the second might not be fully available.

No, wait, when you mix H2SO4 with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the reaction goes to completion. So the H+ from both dissociations would be available. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it will deprotonate both H+ from H2SO4.

But in reality, the first H+ is completely dissociated, the second is weak. But when you have a strong base, it can deprotonate the HSO4^- further. So the reaction would proceed as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, two moles of H+ are neutralized.

So in this case, the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles. HCl contributes 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

But if that's the case, the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have -11.4 kJ. The closest is option D, which is -16 kJ, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, no, option D is -16.0 kJ. Where did that come from?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate based on the moles of each acid reacting with the base.

Let me think in terms of limiting reagents.

The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting.

Thus, all OH- (0.2 moles) will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But in the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct.

But why is option B present as -11.42 kcal? That's about 11.4 × 4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me calculate 11.4 kJ to kcal.

1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine the moles of each substance**:
   - **HCl**: Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **H₂SO₄**: Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \). Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂**: Moles = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate total H⁺ available**:
   - H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent**:
   - Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent since \( 0.2 < 0.28 \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization**:
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol of H⁺} \).
   - Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) are neutralized, the total enthalpy change is:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Converting \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal (\( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \)):
     \[
     \Delta H = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Analyze the options**:
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal)** matches the calculated value.
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal)** is incorrect, as it does not match the conversion of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal.
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal)** and **Option D (-16.0 kJ)** are also incorrect, as they do not align with the calculations.

Thus, the correct answer is **A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
