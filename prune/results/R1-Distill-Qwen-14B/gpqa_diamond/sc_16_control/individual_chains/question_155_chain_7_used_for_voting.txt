Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in a specific state which is an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I think I should start by recalling what the uncertainty principle says. Oh right, the uncertainty ΔP_z is given by the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but the state given is an eigenstate of P_x. So to find the uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute the expectation values. But how do I do that?

First, the state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote this as |ψ⟩. So, |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in this basis. So, to compute the expectation values, I can use the formula ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is the operator.

So, the first thing I need is the matrix for P_z. Looking at the problem statement, P_z has matrix components as follows:

Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ.

Now, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's ψ† P_z ψ. But since ψ is in the P_z basis, this might be straightforward. Alternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues times the square of the amplitudes.

Wait, the state |ψ⟩ would be a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. Let me think: the eigenstates of P_z are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

But wait, in our case, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a linear combination of these. So, |ψ⟩ = a |+z⟩ + b |0z⟩ + c |-z⟩.

Looking at the components of |ψ⟩, which are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), I think those are the coefficients a, b, c. So:

a = -1/2
b = 1/√2
c = -1/2

But wait, let me check: the state is a column vector [a; b; c], so a is the coefficient for the first basis vector (which is |+z⟩), b for |0z⟩, and c for |-z⟩.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ would be a*(ħ) + b*(0) + c*(-ħ). So, (-1/2)(ħ) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ) = [ (-ħ/2) + (ħ/2) ] = 0? Because the middle term is zero and the first and last terms cancel each other: -ħ/2 + ħ/2 = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0. That simplifies things because then, the uncertainty formula becomes ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - 0) = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩).

Now, what's ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So P_z² is:

Row 1: (ħ)^2, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

So, P_z squared is a diagonal matrix with ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be the sum of |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²).

Compute each term:

|a|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|c|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ can be computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is diagonal with elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (\hbar^2) + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 (0) + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} (\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2} (0) + \frac{1}{4} (\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
