Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution.

Alright, let me read the problem again. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, wait, I think I remember that stability constants relate the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of the ions. So, the beta for each complex is the formation constant for that complex.

The question asks about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the third complex (since β3 is 63). Wait, no: wait, the complexes are probably in order of increasing number of SCN- ligands. So the first complex is Co(SCN), the second is Co(SCN)_2, and so on. Or is β1 the first complex, β2 the second, etc. So β3 would be the third, which would be the trithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)_3^2-? Or wait, wait. Let me think: the charge of the complex. Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for each complex, the charge would be +2 - n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands.

So β1 is the first complex: Co(SCN)^(+). Because Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)^(+), so β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

Then β2 would be for Co(SCN)_2^0: because Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^0. So β2=40.

Then β3 is for Co(SCN)_3^-: Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3^-. So β3=63.

Wait, but wait, the problem mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^0, which has β2=40.

Wait, but the options are about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ions. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 species. So the question is asking for the percentage of this species relative to all cobalt species present.

But wait, the question says "dithiocyanato", which I think refers to two SCN ligands. So the complex is Co(SCN)_2^0. So the stability constant is β2=40.

But wait, the problem gives four stability constants, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β4 is the smallest, which is probably the least stable. Let me think about the complexes.

So the first complex is Co(SCN)^(+), with β1=9. The second is Co(SCN)_2^0, β2=40. The third is Co(SCN)_3^−, β3=63. The fourth is Co(SCN)_4^2- , β4=16? That seems odd because β4 is smaller than β3. Maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Or perhaps the β values are for different complexes, maybe not in order of increasing ligands. Hmm, but stability constants increase with the number of ligands in the complex, generally, because each addition brings more stability.

Wait, β3 is the largest at 63. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions. But in the question, they're asking about the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- ions. So β2=40.

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that Co(SCN)_2^0 is the blue one, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the color comes from the particular number of ligands. But regardless, the question specifies that the complexes in consideration are the blue dithiocyanato, so that's the second complex, with β2=40.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of this complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

I remember that for such problems, the fraction of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general formula for each complex is [Co^n+] [SCN^-]^n / β_n, but I think I need to set up the expressions for all possible complexes and then sum them up to find the fraction.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But this includes all the species: Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. So to find the fraction of each, I need to calculate the concentration of each complex and sum them, then find the ratio of the desired complex to the total.

But with multiple complexes, it's a bit involved. Let's think of it as a distribution problem. We can model the distribution of Co(II) among the different complexes and free ions, considering the given stability constants.

The formation of each complex step is as follows:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)^+; β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9
2. Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^0; β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) =40
3. Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3^-; β3 = [Co(SCN)_3]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) =63
4. Co^2+ +4 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4^2-; β4=16

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That seems odd because each successive addition of SCN- would typically have a higher β, but perhaps in this case, the fourth complex is less stable. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the complexes wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me make sure I'm considering the right complexes.

But let's proceed with the given data. The main idea is to compute the fraction of each species. Let's denote:

[Co^2+] = c0
[Co(SCN)] = c1
[Co(SCN)_2] = c2
[Co(SCN)_3] = c3
[Co(SCN)_4] = c4

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = c0 + c1 + c2 + c3 + c4.

Each stability constant relates to the formation of the complex. So:

c1 = β1 * c0 * [SCN^-]
c2 = β2 * c0 * [SCN^-]^2
c3 = β3 * c0 * [SCN^-]^3
c4 = β4 * c0 * [SCN^-]^4

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each stability constant is for the formation of the nth complex from the lower complex. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing the definitions. Let me think again.

The formation of the first complex is Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)^+ with β1 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

The formation of the second complex is Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^0, with β2' = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co(SCN)][SCN^-]) =40.

Wait, but that's only if each step's β is considered as a stepwise formation constant. Alternatively, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 is β_total = β1 * β2'.

Wait, I might be complicating things. Alternatively, the overall formation constant for each complex can be thought of as the product of the stepwise constants. So:

β_total for Co(SCN)_n is β1 * β2 * β3 ... up to n.

Wait, no, each β is the cumulative formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for Co(SCN)_n, the total β is β_n.

Wait, but the problem statement says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." That implies that each β is the overall formation constant for that particular complex.

So for the first complex, Co(SCN)^+, β1=9.

For Co(SCN)_2^0, β2=40.

For Co(SCN)_3^-, β3=63.

For Co(SCN)_4^2-, β4=16.

So the formation of each complex is independent, but in reality, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. However, for the purpose of calculating the distribution, perhaps it's better to model each complex's concentration in terms of the free Co^2+ and the total [SCN^-].

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of each complex can be found by considering the relative β values and the concentration of SCN^-.

But this seems complicated. Another approach is to consider the distribution of the metal among the various complexes, given the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

Let me try setting up the expressions.

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = c0 + c1 + c2 + c3 + c4.

Each c_n is the concentration of the nth complex.

We can express each c_n as c0 * βn * [SCN^-]^n / (β_total?).

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to consider the ratio of each complex to the free ion, then find the fraction.

The fraction f_n of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

But perhaps it's easier to model this using the distribution equations. Let me try to write expressions for each c_n in terms of c0 and [SCN^-].

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is relatively high, and the cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, which is lower.

So, for each complex:

c1 = β1 * c0 * [SCN^-] 

c2 = β2 * c0 * [SCN^-]^2 

c3 = β3 * c0 * [SCN^-]^3 

c4 = β4 * c0 * [SCN^-]^4 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the overall formation constant for each complex is given. So, for the first complex: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co^2+][SCN^-].

For the second complex: [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Similarly:

[Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

So the total cobalt is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

= [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

Factor out [Co^2+]:

c_total = [Co^2+] [1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ].

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

x = c_total / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4 )

where s is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So s = 0.1.

Let me compute each term:

β1 s =9 * 0.1=0.9

β2 s²=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

β3 s³=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

β4 s^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So summing all the terms inside the denominator:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's calculate:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016≈2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646. So x = [Co^2+] = (0.01 M) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, c_total is 0.01 M. So x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, no: the expression is x = c_total / denominator, yes. So [Co^2+] is about 0.004225 M.

Now, we can compute each c_n:

c1 = β1 x s =9 *0.004225 *0.1 = 9 *0.0004225=0.0038025 M.

c2 = β2 x s²=40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01 =40 *0.00004225=0.00169 M.

c3= β3 x s^3=63 *0.004225 * (0.1)^3 =63 *0.004225 *0.001=63 *0.000004225≈0.000266475 M.

c4=β4 x s^4=16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16*0.0000004225≈0.00000676 M.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate some of these.

For c1:

9 *0.004225 = 0.038025, multiplied by 0.1 gives 0.0038025 M.

c2: 40 *0.004225 = 0.169, multiply by 0.01 (s²=0.01) → 0.00169 M.

c3: 63 *0.004225 = 0.266475, multiply by 0.001 (s³=0.001) → 0.000266475 M.

c4: 16 *0.004225 = 0.0676, multiply by 0.0001 (s^4=0.0001) → 0.00000676 M.

Now, let's sum all the c_n's:

c0 = x = 0.004225 M

c1=0.0038025 M

c2=0.00169 M

c3=0.000266475 M

c4=0.00000676 M

Adding them up:

0.004225 +0.0038025 = 0.0080275

+0.00169 → 0.0097175

+0.000266475 → 0.009983975

+0.00000676 → 0.009990735 M.

Wait, but the total c_total is 0.01 M, and the sum is about 0.00999 M, which is close but not exactly 0.01. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding errors in the calculations. But it's close enough.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Assuming that's c2 (Co(SCN)_2), which is 0.00169 M.

So the fraction is (c2) / (c_total) * 100%.

c2 is 0.00169 M, c_total is 0.01 M.

So 0.00169 / 0.01 =0.169 → 16.9% → which is option D.

Wait, but wait, the question says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So the dithiocyanato is two SCN ligands, which is c2.

But wait, in the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches this calculation. So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when I calculated the denominator, I added 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646. Let me recheck the individual terms:

β1 s=9 *0.1=0.9 → correct.

β2 s^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4 → correct.

β3 s^3=63*(0.001)=0.063 → correct.

β4 s^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016 → correct.

Sum is indeed 2.3646.

So x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004225.

Then c2 is 40 *0.004225 *0.01 → 40 *0.00004225 → 0.00169.

So 0.00169 /0.01 =0.169 →16.9% → D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16), the total cobalt concentration ([Co] = 10⁻² M), and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Step 1: Express the concentrations of all cobalt species
The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the free cobalt ion ([Co²⁺]) and its complexes:
\[
[Co] = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].
\]
Using the stability constants, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻]:
\[
[Co(SCN)] = \beta_1 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻],
\]
\[
[Co(SCN)_2] = \beta_2 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^2,
\]
\[
[Co(SCN)_3] = \beta_3 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^3,
\]
\[
[Co(SCN)_4] = \beta_4 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^4.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for [Co²⁺]
The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
[Co] = [Co²⁺] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [SCN⁻] + \beta_2 [SCN⁻]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN⁻]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN⁻]^4 \right).
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\beta_1 [SCN⁻] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9,
\]
\[
\beta_2 [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4,
\]
\[
\beta_3 [SCN⁻]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063,
\]
\[
\beta_4 [SCN⁻]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]
Thus:
\[
[Co²⁺] = \frac{[Co]}{2.3646} = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]
The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
[Co(SCN)_2] = \beta_2 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.01 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]
The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[Co(SCN)_2]}{[Co]} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
