Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is saying.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, not sure if the mass comes into play here but okay, maybe it's a red herring.

The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's the peak wavelength, right? I remember from my notes that the peak wavelength of a black body is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. So both stars have the same temperature, T.

Then there's the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, since we're talking about the peak wavelength as observed, would that mean that the actual emitted wavelength is different from the observed one?

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same for both. But the actual emitted lambda_max depends on their temperatures. So if there's a Doppler shift due to their velocities, that would affect the observed wavelength.

Hmm, so I think we need to correct for the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths get shifted. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is pretty high, that could cause a noticeable shift.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So the emitted wavelengths might be different because of their velocities, but the observed ones are same.

So, let me think. The actual emitted peak wavelength (lambda_emit) of each star is given by Wien's law: lambda_emit = b / T. But since the stars are moving, the observed wavelength (lambda_obs) would be different.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, no. The Doppler effect for light depends on the relative velocity between the source and the observer. If the star is moving away, the wavelength is stretched (redshifted), and if moving towards, it's shortened (blueshifted).

The formula I remember is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, that's a linear approximation. For small velocities, that's okay, but 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So 700 is 700/3e5 ≈ 0.00233 or 0.233% of c. So the linear approximation might be okay, but maybe using the exact relativistic formula would be better.

Wait, the exact formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ). But wait, no, that's the transverse Doppler effect. For radial motion, the formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r/c) when moving away (v_r positive). But actually, I might be mixing up the relativistic and non-relativistic cases.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about this: the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) if the source is moving away, and shorter (blueshifted) if moving towards. So in this problem, Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted. Star_2 is moving away with 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted.

But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

Since Star_1 has v_r =0, lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emit_1.

Star_2 has v_r = +700 km/s (assuming away from us), so lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But wait, the problem says the observed are the same, so:

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)

So,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law, lambda_emit = b / T. So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Simplify: T1 / T2 = (1 + v_r2/c )

Because (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c) => T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )^(-1)

Wait, no, let's see:

lambda_emit_1 = (b / T1 )

lambda_emit_2 = (b / T2 )

So,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2/c

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the star is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying that the emitted wavelength is shorter (so higher temperature) compared to the observed. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the Doppler effect correctly.

When a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So,

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r / c )

Assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

So, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Star_1 has v_r1 = 0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

Given that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2,

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law, lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

lambda_emit1 = b / T1,

lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

Substituting,

b/T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2/c

=> T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but that would mean that T2 is higher than T1? But in our case, Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer, implying that its emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed. So, T2 is higher than T1?

Wait, if Star_2's observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's, but Star_2 is moving away, that would mean that Star_2's emitted wavelength is shorter (since moving away makes observed longer). Shorter emitted wavelength implies higher temperature.

So, T2 > T1.

So from the equation, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

But wait, v_r2 is positive when moving away, so 1 + v_r2/c is greater than 1, so T2 is higher than T1.

But the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, so their observed lambda_max is the same. Therefore, the emitted lambda_emit2 must be shorter than lambda_emit1 because Star_2 is moving away.

Wait, but considering that Star_1's v_r is zero, lambda_emit1 equals lambda_obs1. Star_2's lambda_obs2 is same as Star_1's, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

But lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But lambda_emit1 = b / T1,

lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2/c

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 is larger than T1.

So, the temperatures are not the same. That's contrary to my initial thought when I thought they had same T. But wait, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, the problem says they appear brightest at the same wavelength. Which is the observed lambda_max. So the actual emitted lambda_emit is different for each star because of their velocities.

Wait, but if that's the case, then their temperatures are different.

So, the initial assumption that they have the same temperature is incorrect. That's an error. Because their temperatures would be different.

Wait, but how? Because the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed lambda_max is same. But the emitted lambda_emit depends on T.

Wait, so from the Doppler effect, the observed lambda_max is lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

So, for Star_1, lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1,

for Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Given that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2,

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But lambda_emit is b/T, so,

lambda_emit1 = (b / T1 )

lambda_emit2 = (b / T2 )

So,

(b / T1 ) = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1 / T1 = (1 / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r2/c

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

Which implies T2 > T1.

So, now we know the temperatures are different. So, what's the next part of the problem?

The question is about the luminosity. The problem states that astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, what is the ratio L1 / L2?

Luminosity of a star (assuming black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

Ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

So,

L1/L2 = [ (1.5 R2 )² * (T1^4) ] / [ R2² * (T2^4) ]

Simplify:

= (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 / ( R2² T2^4 )

R2² cancels,

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4

But we have T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Therefore,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ]^4

Now, plug in the numbers.

v_r2 is 700 km/s. c is about 299,792 km/s ≈ 3e5 km/s.

So, v_r2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333...

So,

(1 + v_r2/c ) = 1.0023333.

So,

1/(1.0023333 ) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

[1/(1.0023333)]^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that. Let's calculate 0.99768^4.

First, let's compute the natural log.

ln(0.99768) ≈ -0.00232 (since ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x. Here x is about 0.00232.)

So, ln(0.99768^4 ) = 4 * (-0.00232 ) = -0.00928.

e^(-0.00928 ) ≈ 1 - 0.00928 + (0.00928^2)/2 ≈ 1 -0.00928 + 0.000043 ≈ 0.99076.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.99768^4 step by step.

Compute 0.99768 * 0.99768 = (approx 0.99768)^2.

0.99768 * 0.99768:

= (1 - 0.00232 )^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.995365.

Then, square that to get (0.99768)^4 = (0.995365 )^2.

Again,

(0.995365 )^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004635 )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 *0.004635 + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00927 + 0.0000215 ≈ 0.99075.

So, [1/(1.0023333)]^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But 0.99075 is 0.99 + 0.00075.

So,

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275,

2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.0016875 ≈ 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c ), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c ).

But in the luminosity ratio, it's (T1/T2 )^4.

So, (T1/T2 )^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23.

So, the factor is about 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Because L1 is (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1^2 / R2^2 is 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 is (T1/T2 )^4 = [1/(1.00233)]^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So, 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.229.

So, L1 is about 2.23 times L2.

The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and relevant astrophysical relationships.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{r,1} = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **Relevant Laws**:
   - **Wien's Law**: \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \) is the emitted peak wavelength and \( T \) is the temperature.
   - **Doppler Effect for Wavelength**: \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c) \), where \( v_r \) is the radial velocity and \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( L \) is the luminosity, \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

### Analysis:
1. **Observed Wavelengths**:
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), and \( v_{r,1} = 0 \), the emitted wavelengths must satisfy:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_{r,2}/c)
   \]
   Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = b/T \)), this implies:
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_{r,2}}{c}
   \]
   Substituting \( v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 1.00233
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99768
   \]

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1/T_2 \approx 0.99768 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99768)^4
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
   - \( (0.99768)^4 \approx 0.99075 \) (using approximations for small \( v_r/c \))

   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99075 \approx 2.229
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**Options**:
- A) ~2.25
- B) ~2.32
- C) ~2.35
- D) ~2.23

The correct answer is **D) ~2.23**.
