Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate, that's PO₄^3- right? 

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters). It contains 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, but maybe it affects the pH or Ka values? The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. 

Wait, so the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are phosphate buffer components. KH2PO4 is the diprotic acid (H2PO4^-), and Na2HPO4 is the dihydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-), right? So when these two are mixed, they should form a buffer solution. 

The first thing I need to do is find out the concentrations of each of these salts in the solution. Then, maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and from there, find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me calculate the moles of each. 

For KH2PO4: moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by about 136 is around 0.00735 moles. Let me be precise: 1 / 136.09 = approximately 0.007338 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 divided by 178 is about 0.005618 mol. So approximately 0.005618 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Na2HPO4·2H2O—so the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water, which probably doesn't affect the ions in solution. So the moles of HPO4^2- would be the same as the moles of the salt, which is 0.005618 mol.

Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-; so each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Since these are a conjugate acid-base pair (H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base), the buffer system is between them. The pKa for this pair would be the second dissociation step, right? Because H3PO4 loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- loses a proton to become HPO4^2- (Ka2). So the relevant pKa here is Ka2.

So pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208. Wait, let me calculate that accurately. The log of 6.2e-8 is log(6.2) + log(1e-8). Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 0.792 -8 = -7.208? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka), so that would be -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute it using a calculator approach.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) = 0.7923, plus log(1e-8) = -8. So total is -7.2077. So pKa2 is 7.2077, approximately 7.21.

Now, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-. So the ratio is the moles of HPO4^2- divided by the moles of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but wait, I have 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2- and 0.007338 mol of H2PO4^-. So the ratio [base]/[acid] is (0.005618)/(0.007338) ≈ 0.7657.

So log(0.7657) is about -0.115. So pH = 7.21 + (-0.115) ≈ 7.095.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the concentrations in the solution, not the moles. Because the buffer solution's pH depends on the concentration ratio, which is moles divided by the same volume, so the volume cancels out. So yes, the ratio of moles is sufficient for the Henderson equation.

So the pH would be around 7.095. But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. Hmm, how do I get that?

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-. H3PO4 is triprotic. First, it loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (Ka1), then HPO4^2- (Ka2), then PO4^3- (Ka3). So the third dissociation is very weak, since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than the others. 

At pH 7.1, which is just below the pKa2 (7.21), the solution is slightly acidic, so H2PO4^- would be the dominant species, with some HPO4^2- present. But PO4^3- would be minimal, because the pH is much higher than pKa3 (which is around 12), so in this solution, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. 

Wait, but the problem is to find [PO4^3-]. How do I approach that?

Hmm, perhaps I can consider the third dissociation step. Since PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. But given that the pH is 7.1, which is much lower than pKa3 (which is around 12), so the concentration of PO4^3- would be very small.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution uses the buffer equation to find the pH, then apply the third dissociation to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, perhaps I should model the phosphate species distribution. Let me think. The species present in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in the solution, we have added H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4), so the primary species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The H3PO4 is negligible because the pH is around 7, which is higher than pKa1 (7.2), so H2PO4^- is the dominant species. Wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-; pKa1 is around 2.12 (since Ka1 is 7.5e-3, pKa1 is about 2.12). Wait, wait, no. Wait, I thought pKa2 is 7.21, but earlier I calculated pKa2 as 7.21. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me recalibrate. The Ka1 is for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-: Ka1 =7.5e-3 → pKa1 = 2.12.

Ka2 is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-: Ka2=6.2e-8 → pKa2≈7.21.

Ka3 is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-: Ka3=1.8e-12 → pKa3≈11.74.

So the solution's pH is around 7.095. So for the HPO4^2-/PO4^3- system (pKa3=11.74), the pH is much lower, so PO4^3- concentration would be very small.

But wait, perhaps we can calculate [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.

At pH 7.095, the concentration of H+ is 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So, using the expression for Ka3:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] from the solution, which is 0.005618 mol in 0.2 L → 0.02809 M.

Wait, no. Wait, the concentration of HPO4^2- is (moles)/(volume in L). So 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M.

[H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

So plugging into the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02809) / (8.23e-8)

Let me compute that.

First, 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0562e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0562 / 8.23) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.614 * 1e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. This seems a bit high. Because at pH 7, which is much lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, let me compute step by step:

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[H+]=8.23e-8.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] 

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.23e-8)

= (5.0562e-14) / (8.23e-8)

= (5.0562 / 8.23) * 1e-6

5.0562 ÷ 8.23 is approximately 0.614.

So 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the HPO4^2- concentration.

Wait, the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol.

Let me calculate that again: 1.00 / 177.99 = approximately 0.005618 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the activity coefficients or something else, but I think the problem expects us to proceed with this approach.

So according to this, [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.14e-7 M, which would correspond to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, the options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

Hmm, 6.14e-7 is close to option A's 6.24e-7. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the pH. Let me double-check the pH calculation.

We have:

n(H2PO4^-) = 0.007338 mol

n(HPO4^2-) = 0.005618 mol

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is (0.005618) / (0.007338) ≈ 0.7657.

Taking log(0.7657):

Hmm, log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.75)= -0.1249, log(0.7657) is between -0.11 and -0.12.

Let me calculate it accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

We can use the log(0.7657) ≈ log(7.657e-1) = log(7.657) + log(1e-1).

Log(7.657) is about 0.8847 (since 10^0.88 is 7.6), so log(7.657) is about 0.8847.

So log(0.7657) = 0.8847 -1 = -0.1153.

So pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.21 + (-0.1153) ≈ 7.0947.

So pH≈7.095.

Wait, but when using the Henderson equation, if the pH is below pKa2, the solution is acidic relative to the HPO4^2- / H2PO4^- system. So H2PO4^- is the major species.

Now, for the third dissociation, HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

[H+] is 10^-pH = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So substituting:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.23e-8) 

= (5.0562e-14) / (8.23e-8) 

= 6.14e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.14e-7 M. The option closest is A) 6.24e-7.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recompute the division.

5.0562e-14 divided by 8.23e-8:

5.0562e-14 /8.23e-8 = (5.0562 /8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0562 /8.23 = approximately 0.614.

So 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7.

Hmm, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 0.624e-6, a little higher. Maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value of (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.23e-8).

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 1.8 * 0.02809 = 0.050562 → 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So 5.0562e-14 /8.23e-8 = (5.0562 / 8.23) * 1e-6.

Calculate 5.0562 /8.23:

8.23 * 0.614 ≈ 5.0562? Let me compute 8.23 * 0.614:

8 * 0.614 = 4.912.

0.23 * 0.614 ≈ 0.141.

So total ≈ 4.912 +0.141=5.053, which is very close to 5.0562.

So 5.0562 /8.23 = 0.614.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

So the answer should be approximately 6.14e-7, which is not exactly one of the options. The closest is option A) 6.24e-7, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer and that the pH is determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations. Then, using that pH, calculate the [PO4^3-] from HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the small amount of PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation. But given that the pH is 7.095, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.74), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, approximately (Ka3 / [H+]) * [HPO4^2-].

Wait, another approach: the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

Rearranged:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is what I did earlier.

But perhaps I should calculate [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.095 → [H+] = 10^(-7.095) = ?

Let me compute 10^(-7.095) exactly.

10^7 = 10,000,000.

So 10^0.095 is approximately 1.2457 (since 10^0.1 ≈1.2589, 0.095 is a bit less). Let's compute:

10^0.095 = e^(0.095 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.095 * 2.302585) ≈ e^(0.218745) ≈ 1.244.

So 10^(-7.095) = 1 / (10^7.095) = 1/(10^7 *10^0.095) )= 1/(10^7 *1.244) )= 1/(12,440,000) ≈ 8.046e-8.

Wait, I think earlier I used 8.23e-8. Hmmm, perhaps I should redo this accurately.

Wait, 7.095 is the pH, which is 7 + 0.095.

So 10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095) = 1e-7 * (1 / 10^0.095).

10^0.095 ≈ 1.244 (as above), so 1/1.244 ≈ 0.8046.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8046 ≈ 8.046e-8 M.

So [H+] = 8.046e-8 M.

Now, substituting into [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.046e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.046e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (5.0562e-14) / (8.046e-8) → 5.0562 /8.046 = approx 0.6285 → 0.6285e-6 → 6.285e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.285e-7 M. Which is very close to option A) 6.24e-7.

Ah, so perhaps earlier calculation had a slight error in [H+], and the precise calculation brings it to 6.28e-7. So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Considering possible rounding during calculations, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option D or another.

Wait, let me check the problem again. The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution considers both the contributions from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- dissociating further. But no, because in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; the amount of PO4^3- comes only from the HPO4^2- dissociation.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that some of the H2PO4^- could also dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+. But no, because the pH is lower than pKa2, so H2PO4^- is the major species, and HPO4^2- is minor. So the [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M, as calculated.

I think my calculations are correct, leading to approximately 6.28e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7) but slightly higher. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's option D.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, for KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007338 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99= approx 0.005618 mol.

Volume is 0.2 liters.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 /0.2 = 0.03669 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 /0.2 = 0.02809 M.

So when calculating the pH, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used the ratio of the moles but their concentrations. But since both are in the same volume, the ratio remains the same. So the pH calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is more complex. Because when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution might shift to reach equilibrium, but I think the Henderson equation accounts for that.

Another alternative approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact H+ concentration, then find [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of [H+] and recalculate [PO4^3-].

[H+] = 8.046e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.046e-8 → (5.0562e-14) /8.046e-8 → 6.285e-7 M.

So that's about 6.285e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7.

But wait, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half. Did I make a mistake in the volume? Let me double-check.

Wait, the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2000 liters. So when converting grams to concentrations, it's moles per 0.2 liters.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution's ionic strength affects the activity, but I think the problem doesn't expect that level of detail. So I'll proceed.

So the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.28e-7 M, which would correspond to option A.

But looking at the options again, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, with molecular weights 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2000 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Determine concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- [H₂PO₄⁻] = \( \frac{0.007338 \, \text{mol}}{0.2000 \, \text{L}} = 0.03669 \, \text{M} \)
- [HPO₄²⁻] = \( \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.2000 \, \text{L}} = 0.02809 \, \text{M} \)

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21\). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02809}{0.03669}\right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.7657) \approx 7.21 - 0.1153 = 7.095
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \, \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Using the expression for Ka₃:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

The concentration of H⁺ is calculated from the pH:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.046 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.046 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0562 \times 10^{-14}}{8.046 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.285 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of [PO₄³⁻] is approximately \( 6.285 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

ANSWER: A
