Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem says that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the standard lithium-7 isotope has 3 neutrons, right? Because lithium has atomic number 3, so normally it's 3 protons and 4 neutrons for Li-7. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has atomic number 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6. Oh, right, because Li-6 is a common isotope. So the mass we need is that of Li-6.

So I need to find the energy for this nucleus when it's moving at v=0.96c. Since it's a heavy ion collider, I think we're dealing with relativistic speeds, so I should use the relativistic energy equations.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to find gamma first.

Wait, v is 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma. So plugging in the numbers, v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.571428... So that's gamma.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. For a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the mass defect (binding energy), but since we're looking for the rest mass, I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass in u (atomic mass units). So I should find the mass of Li-6 in kg, then multiply by c² to get the rest energy.

But wait, I don't remember the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. The mass of a proton is about 1.67262e-27 kg, neutron is about 1.67493e-27 kg, but for precise calculations, perhaps using the atomic mass is better.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is roughly... I think it's about 6.940938 u. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Actually, looking it up, but since I can't look it up, I'll approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the problem might expect me to use a standard approach, but I need to get the numbers right.

Wait, maybe the problem will give me the mass of the nucleus? Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the general formula.

So, the rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the mass of the nucleus. Let's denote m as the mass of Li-6.

So E_total = gamma * m c².

But wait, I need to compute the total energy, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. However, in particle accelerators, the energy given is often the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, but the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think in this case, they're referring to the kinetic energy because the total energy would be much higher than just the kinetic.

Wait no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. The energy of the collider is usually the kinetic energy imparted to the particles, but sometimes it refers to the total energy. I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says, "What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So perhaps they are asking for the total energy, because the speed is a function of the gamma factor, which is based on total energy.

Alternatively, sometimes when people talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, they refer to the kinetic energy. So perhaps I need to calculate the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) * m c².

Wait, but the options are in GeV. So I need to compute the rest mass in GeV/c², multiply by (gamma - 1) c² to get the kinetic energy in GeV.

So let me proceed step by step.

Compute gamma: v = 0.96c, so beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, find the rest mass energy of Li-6 in GeV.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.940938 u (I think I've seen this number before; Li-6 has a mass of about 6.941 u). Each u is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c².

Wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 0.9315 GeV/c².

So m = 6.940938 u * 0.9315 GeV/c² per u = let's compute that.

6.940938 * 0.9315 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589
0.940938 * 0.9315 ≈ approximately 0.875 (since 0.94 * 0.93 is about 0.8742)
So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.875 ≈ 6.464 GeV/c².

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6.941 * 0.9315.

Wait, 6.941 * 0.9315.

Let me compute it more accurately:

6.941 * 0.9315.

Multiply 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.941 * 0.9315.

Compute 0.9 * 0.9315 = 0.83835.

0.04 * 0.9315 = 0.03726.

0.001 * 0.9315 = 0.0009315.

Adding up: 0.83835 + 0.03726 = 0.87561; plus 0.0009315 gives 0.8765415.

So total is 5.589 + 0.8765415 = 6.4655415 GeV/c².

So m c² is about 6.4655 GeV.

Wait, but wait: 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c², which is 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.940938 u * 0.931494 GeV/c²/u = let's compute.

6.940938 * 0.931494.

Hmm, perhaps better to compute as:

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964

0.940938 * 0.931494:

Let me compute that.

0.940938 × 0.931494.

Approximating:

0.94 * 0.93 = 0.8742.

But more accurately:

0.940938 × 0.931494 ≈ let's compute using more precise steps.

Let me compute 0.940938 × 0.931494.

Approximate:

0.94 * 0.93 = (0.9 * 0.9) + (0.9 * 0.03) + (0.04 * 0.9) + (0.04 * 0.03) ) → wait, perhaps another method.

Alternatively, multiply 940938 × 931494, but that's too tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps use calculator-like steps.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, an approximate value is acceptable, but given the options, I might need to be precise.

Wait, if I compute 6.940938 × 0.931494:

Compute:

6.940938 × 0.931494.

Break it down:

= (6 + 0.940938) × 0.931494

= 6 × 0.931494 + 0.940938 × 0.931494

6 × 0.931494 = 5.588964

Now, 0.940938 × 0.931494.

Let me compute this as 0.940938 × 0.931494.

Compute 0.94 × 0.93 = 0.8742.

But more accurately:

= (0.94 × 0.93) + (0.000938 × 0.93) + (0.94 × 0.001494) + (0.000938 × 0.001494)

Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can use a linear approximation.

Wait, but for precise calculation, perhaps it's better to use an accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

m c² = (number of nucleons) × (mass of a nucleon) - binding energy.

But that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the mass of Li-6 as approximately 6.941 u.

So, 6.941 u × 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute this: 6 × 0.931494 = 5.588964 GeV.

0.941 × 0.931494 = ?

Compute 0.9 * 0.931494 = 0.8383446.

0.04 * 0.931494 = 0.03725976.

0.001 * 0.931494 = 0.000931494.

Adding: 0.8383446 + 0.03725976 = 0.87560436; + 0.000931494 gives 0.876535854.

So total is 5.588964 + 0.876535854 ≈ 6.4655 GeV.

Wait, but wait. 6 × 0.931494 is 5.588964.

0.941 × 0.931494: let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.941 × 0.931494.

Let me compute:

0.941 × 0.931494.

Compute 0.9 × 0.931494 = 0.8383446.

0.04 × 0.931494 = 0.03725976.

0.001 × 0.931494 = 0.000931494.

Adding them: 0.8383446 + 0.03725976 = 0.87560436 + 0.000931494 = 0.876535854.

So, the total m c² is 5.588964 + 0.876535854 ≈ 6.4655 GeV.

So m c² ≈ 6.4655 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy (K.E.) is (gamma - 1) × m c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So K.E. = (3.5714 - 1) × 6.4655 ≈ 2.5714 × 6.4655.

Compute 2.5714 × 6.4655.

Let me compute 2 ×6.4655 =12.931.

0.5714 ×6.4655.

Wait, 0.5 ×6.4655 =3.23275.

0.0714 ×6.4655 ≈ approx 0.0714 ×6=0.4284, 0.0714×0.4655≈0.0332. So total ≈0.4284+0.0332=0.4616.

So 0.5714 ×6.4655 ≈ 3.23275 + 0.4616 ≈3.69435.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.5714 ×6.4655.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 6.4655 × 0.5714.

= 6.4655 × (0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0014)

= 6.4655 × 0.5 = 3.23275

6.4655 × 0.07 = 0.452585.

6.4655 ×0.0014 ≈0.0090517.

Adding them: 3.23275 +0.452585=3.685335 +0.0090517=3.6943867.

So K.E. ≈12.931 (from 2×6.4655) +3.6943867 ≈16.625 GeV.

But wait, that can't be right because the options are around 18-23 GeV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Because I think I might have confused whether to use kinetic energy or total energy.

Wait, the problem asks for the energy of the RHIC. So, does the RHIC's energy refer to the kinetic energy (K.E.) or the total energy (gamma m c²)?

I think in particle physics, when people talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially for heavy ions, it's given as the total energy. So I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again.

Gamma is 3.5714, so the total energy is gamma * m c^2 = 3.5714 * 6.4655 GeV ≈?

3.5714 ×6.4655.

Calculate it step by step.

3 ×6.4655 = 19.3965.

0.5714 ×6.4655 ≈ as before 3.6944.

Adding together: 19.3965 +3.6944≈23.0909 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 23.09 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the total energy is 23.09 GeV, but the options have 23.069 GeV. So perhaps the precise calculation gives 23.069.

But where might I have made a mistake?

Wait, perhaps my approximation for the mass was off. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact mass is about 6.940938 u. Let me compute 6.940938 × 0.931494 GeV/c².

Let me compute 6 ×0.931494=5.588964.

0.940938 ×0.931494.

So compute 0.940938 ×0.931494.

I can compute this as:

= (0.94 + 0.000938) ×0.931494

= 0.94×0.931494 + 0.000938×0.931494.

Compute 0.94 ×0.931494:

0.94 × 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute 0.9 ×0.931494 = 0.8383446.

0.04 ×0.931494=0.03725976.

Sum: 0.8383446 +0.03725976=0.87560436.

Now, 0.000938 ×0.931494= approx 0.000938 ×0.931494≈0.000878.

So total is 0.87560436 + 0.000878 = 0.87648236 GeV.

So the total m c^2 is 5.588964 +0.87648236 =6.465446 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714286.

So, gamma × m c^2 = 3.5714286 ×6.465446 GeV.

Calculate 3 ×6.465446 =19.396338.

0.5714286 ×6.465446.

Compute 0.5 ×6.465446=3.232723.

0.0714286 ×6.465446.

Hmm, 0.07 ×6.465446=0.45258122.

0.0014286 ×6.465446≈0.0092305.

So 0.45258122 +0.0092305=0.4618117.

So 3.232723 +0.4618117=3.6945347.

So total energy is 19.396338 +3.6945347 =23.0908727 GeV.

Which is approximately 23.0909 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, perhaps my approximations have a slight error.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is more precise. Let me recalculate gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857.

So that's exact.

What about the exact value of 6.940938 u ×0.931494 GeV/u.

Let me compute 6.940938 ×0.931494.

Breaking it down:

=6 ×0.931494 +0.940938 ×0.931494.

6 ×0.931494=5.588964.

Now, 0.940938 ×0.931494.

Let me compute this exactly. 0.940938 ×0.931494.

= (0.94 ×0.93) + (0.94 ×0.001494) + (0.000938 ×0.93) + (0.000938 ×0.001494)

Wait, perhaps better to do it as:

0.940938 ×0.931494 = ?

Let me compute 0.940938 * 0.931494.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach.

0.940938 × 0.931494:

Multiply 940938 × 931494, then adjust the decimal.

Wait, but that's too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps use a binomial approximation or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps use the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps the exact product is:

0.940938 * 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute more accurately:

= (0.94 + 0.000938) × (0.93 + 0.001494)

= 0.94 ×0.93 + 0.94×0.001494 + 0.000938×0.93 + 0.000938×0.001494

= (0.8742) + (0.00140856) + (0.00087334) + (0.000001399)

Adding these together:

0.8742 + 0.00140856 = 0.87560856.

+0.00087334 = 0.8764819.

+0.000001399 ≈0.8764833.

So the mass term is 0.8764833 GeV.

Thus, m c² =5.588964 +0.8764833=6.4654473 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 ×6.4654473.

Let me compute 3 ×6.4654473 =19.396342.

0.57142857 ×6.4654473.

Let me compute 0.5 ×6.4654473=3.23272365.

0.07142857 ×6.4654473 ≈?

0.07 ×6.4654473=0.45258131.

0.00142857 ×6.4654473≈0.0092303.

So 0.45258131 + 0.0092303 =0.4618116.

So 3.23272365 +0.4618116 =3.69453525.

Adding to 19.396342 gives 19.396342 +3.69453525 =23.09087725 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps I made a minor approximation error. Maybe the exact value, when computed precisely, would give 23.069 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the m c² calculation.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of Li-6 is 6.940938 u, so 6.940938 ×0.931494 GeV.

Let me compute 6.940938 ×0.931494:

=6.940938 × 0.931494.

Hmm, perhaps using more accurate multiplication:

6.940938 × 0.931494.

Let me compute this:

6.940938
×0.931494
= ?

Wait, perhaps use the exact method. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the precise calculation yields approximately 23.09 GeV, but the option B is 23.069 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which is gamma × m c². So 3.5714 ×6.4655 GeV is approximately 23.09 GeV, which is close to option B (23.069 GeV), but not exact. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise terms.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation involves more precise handling of the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as exact, and the precise calculation gives 23.069 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using the precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute gamma again.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/ sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

Now, 6.940938 u × 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

6.940938 × 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute this exact step.

6 × 0.931494 =5.588964.

0.940938 ×0.931494.

Let me compute 0.940938 × 0.931494.

Use the formula (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd.

Let a=0.94, b=0.000938.

c=0.93, d=0.001494.

So (0.94)(0.93) = 0.8742.

(0.94)(0.001494) = 0.00140856.

(0.000938)(0.93) = 0.00087334.

(0.000938)(0.001494) = 0.000001399.

Adding all together: 0.8742 + 0.00140856 = 0.87560856.

+ 0.00087334 = 0.8764819.

+ 0.000001399 ≈0.8764833.

So 0.940938 ×0.931494 =0.8764833.

Thus, m c² =5.588964 + 0.8764833 =6.4654473 GeV.

Now, gamma × m c² =3.57142857 ×6.4654473.

Compute 3 ×6.4654473=19.3963419.

0.57142857 ×6.4654473.

Compute 0.5 ×6.4654473=3.23272365.

0.07142857 ×6.4654473.

Compute 0.07 ×6.4654473=0.452581311.

0.00142857 ×6.4654473=0.009230308.

So 0.452581311 +0.009230308 =0.461811619.

So 3.23272365 +0.461811619 =3.694535269.

Adding the 19.3963419 gives 19.3963419 +3.694535269 =23.09087717 GeV.

Now, considering the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because the exact value of the mass is different. Maybe I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps checking the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking it up, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.940938 u. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rest mass is considered in terms of the actual nucleus, which includes the binding energy.

Wait, but the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. So the mass is 6.940938 u, which already accounts for the binding energy.

So perhaps I'm correct with the calculation, but the options are off by a bit. Then why is option B 23.069 GeV?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

beta = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

Compute beta squared: 0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass and the conversion factor.

Wait, 1 u is exactly 931.494062 MeV/c², which is 0.931494062 GeV/c².

So let's compute 6.940938 u ×0.931494062 GeV/c²/u.

6 ×0.931494062 =5.588964372 GeV.

0.940938 ×0.931494062.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.940938 ×0.931494062.

We'll compute this as:

= (0.94 ×0.93) + (0.94 ×0.001494062) + (0.000938 ×0.93) + (0.000938 ×0.001494062)

= 0.8742 + (0.94 ×0.001494062) + (0.000938 ×0.93) + (0.000938 ×0.001494062)

Compute each term:

0.94 ×0.001494062 = 0.00140850028.

0.000938 ×0.93 = 0.00087334.

0.000938 ×0.001494062 = approx 0.000001399.

So sum all terms:

0.8742 + 0.00140850028 =0.87560850028.

+0.00087334 =0.87648184028.

+0.000001399 =0.87648323928.

So m c² =5.588964372 +0.87648323928 =6.465447611 GeV.

Now, gamma × m c² =3.57142857 ×6.465447611.

Compute:

3 ×6.465447611=19.396342833.

0.57142857 ×6.465447611.

= 0.5 ×6.465447611=3.2327238055.

+ 0.07142857 ×6.465447611.

Compute 0.07142857 ×6.465447611.

= 0.07 ×6.465447611 = 0.45258133277.

+ 0.00142857 ×6.465447611 = 0.0092303102.

So total=0.45258133277 +0.0092303102 ≈0.461811643.

So 3.2327238055 +0.461811643=3.6945354485.

Adding to 19.396342833 gives 19.396342833 +3.6945354485 =23.09087828 GeV.

Hmm, so 23.09087828 GeV. Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. So perhaps due to more precise calculation, it's a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the m c² calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma-1=2.57142857.

Multiply by m c²=6.465447611 GeV.

So 2.57142857 ×6.465447611.

Compute:

2 ×6.465447611=12.93089522.

0.57142857 ×6.465447611.

=0.5 ×6.465447611=3.2327238055.

0.07142857 ×6.465447611=0.461811643.

Adding them: 3.2327238055 +0.461811643=3.6945354485.

So K.E. =12.93089522 +3.6945354485 =16.6254306685 GeV.

So that's approx 16.625 GeV.

But none of the options are close to that. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. So the correct answer would be about 23.09 GeV, but the closest option is B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps using precise values, the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 6.940938 ×0.931494062.

Let me compute this more accurately.

6.940938 ×0.931494062.

Compute:

6.940938 × 0.931494062.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator:

6.940938 × 0.931494062.

Let me compute 6.940938 × 0.931494062.

I'll compute this step by step.

Multiply 6.940938 by 0.931494062.

= 6 ×0.931494062 =5.588964372.

0.940938 ×0.931494062.

Now, let me compute 0.940938 ×0.931494062.

Compute as:

0.940938 × 0.931494062 = ?

Let me compute 0.940938 × 0.931494062.

= (0.94 + 0.000938) × (0.93 + 0.001494062)

= 0.94 ×0.93 + 0.94×0.001494062 + 0.000938 ×0.93 + 0.000938 ×0.001494062.

Compute each term:

0.94 ×0.93 =0.8742.

0.94 ×0.001494062=0.00140850028.

0.000938 ×0.93 =0.00087334.

0.000938 ×0.001494062≈0.000001399.

Adding together: 0.8742 + 0.00140850028 =0.87560850028.

+0.00087334 =0.87648184028.

+0.000001399=0.87648323928.

So, 0.940938 ×0.931494062=0.87648323928.

Thus, m c²=5.588964372 +0.87648323928=6.465447611 GeV.

Now, gamma=3.57142857.

So E_total =3.57142857 ×6.465447611.

Compute this:

3.57142857 ×6.465447611.

Let me compute this as:

3 ×6.465447611=19.396342833.

0.57142857 ×6.465447611.

0.5 ×6.465447611=3.2327238055.

0.07142857 ×6.465447611.

Compute 0.07 ×6.465447611=0.45258133277.

0.00142857 ×6.465447611=0.0092303102.

Total for 0.07142857 ×6.465447611=0.45258133277 +0.0092303102=0.46181164297.

So 3.2327238055 +0.46181164297=3.69453544847.

Adding to 19.396342833 gives 19.396342833 +3.69453544847=23.090878281 GeV.

So, 23.09087828 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. So the closest is B, but perhaps the precise calculation is slightly lower.

Wait, perhaps I should consider more precise values for gamma.

Wait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

We can compute this more precisely.

Compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

So that's exact.

Hmm, perhaps the error comes from the initial mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is a bit different. For example, if the mass is 6.940942 u, the calculation would be a bit higher.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to proceed with the given options, and the correct answer is B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the correct calculation leads to 23.09 GeV, but the option B is 23.069 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in MeV and then converting to GeV, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the kinetic energy.

Wait, if K.E. is (gamma-1) m c^2.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So (gamma-1)=2.57142857.

Then, K.E.=2.57142857 *6.465447611 GeV.

Compute 2 ×6.465447611=12.93089522.

0.57142857 ×6.465447611.

As before, 0.57142857 ×6.465447611=approx 3.694535.

So K.E. is 12.930895 +3.694535=16.62543 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So I think the problem refers to the total energy.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 23.09 GeV, but the closest option is B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the entire process using more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation using more decimal places.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the lithium nucleus as 6.94094 u, and then gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m * c².

So E =3.57142857 ×6.94094 ×0.931494.

Wait, 6.94094 u ×0.931494 GeV/u=6.94094 ×0.931494= let me compute this precisely.

6.94094 ×0.931494 = ?

Hmm, perhaps use a calculator-like approach.

Let me compute 6.94094 ×0.931494.

6 ×0.931494 =5.588964.

0.94094 ×0.931494.

Compute 0.94094 ×0.931494.

Again, break it down:

0.94094 ×0.931494 = ?

= (0.94 ×0.93) + (0.94 ×0.001494) + (0.00094 ×0.93) + (0.00094 ×0.001494)

= 0.8742 + 0.00140856 + 0.0008742 + 0.000001399.

Adding these:

0.8742 +0.00140856=0.87560856.

+0.0008742=0.87648276.

+0.000001399=0.876484159.

So, 6.94094 ×0.931494 =5.588964 +0.876484159=6.465448159 GeV.

Then, E=3.57142857 ×6.465448159.

Compute this:

3 ×6.465448159=19.396344477.

0.57142857 ×6.465448159.

As before, 0.57142857 ×6.465448159=3.69453546.

So, E=19.396344477 +3.69453546=23.090879937 GeV.

Which is approximately 23.09088 GeV.

Hmm, the options are B)23.069 GeV, which is roughly 23.069.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects the relativistic energy in terms of the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for relativistic energy when beta is given.

E=gamma m c², and gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta²).

beta=0.96.

So, E= m c² / sqrt(1 - 0.96²).

Which is m c² / sqrt(0.0784) = m c² /0.28.

Which is m c² ×3.57142857.

So, if m c² is 6.465447 GeV, then E=6.465447 ×3.57142857=23.090878 GeV.

So, the precise calculation leads to 23.090878 GeV, which is approximately 23.09 GeV.

But option B is 23.069 GeV, which is 23.069, so that's 0.021 GeV less.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the mass of Li-6 is slightly less than 6.940938 u.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is 6.940938 u, but let's think about the binding energy.

Wait, the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is indeed 6.940938 u. So perhaps the problem expects me to use that value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the rest mass in MeV and then converting. But I think I did it correctly.

Another possibility is that the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but that leads to 16 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy of each nucleus, which would be 23.09 GeV, and the closest option is B)23.069 GeV. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed, and I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is slightly different.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no mistake there.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the kinetic energy in the center-of-momentum frame, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as 6.465 GeV, and then multiplied by gamma as 3.5714, leading to 23.09 GeV. But the options only go to four decimal places, perhaps the problem rounds it to 23.07 GeV.

In that case, the correct answer is B)23.069 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.940938 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.940938 \times 0.931494 \, \text{GeV} \approx 6.4655 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 6.4655 \, \text{GeV} \approx 23.0909 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The closest option to the calculated value of \( 23.0909 \, \text{GeV} \) is **B) 23.069 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight variations in the input values.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC is approximately **23.069 GeV**.

Answer: B
