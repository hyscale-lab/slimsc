Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw that structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. The substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3. Wait, benzene numbering can be tricky. So if the substituents are at 1,2,3, they're meta to each other, but let me confirm.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me number the positions. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are adjacent, but wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent. So they are all in a row? Or maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, another approach: the IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So they're adjacent to each other in a row. So the substituents are in positions 1,2,3 of the ring.

Now, starting from benzene, I need to figure out the reaction sequence to get all these substituents in the correct positions with high yield.

So the substituents are ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2) groups. Each of these is introduced via electrophilic substitution, but the order matters because each substitution directs the next.

First, think about the directing effects of each group:

- Ethoxy (OEt): It's an activating group, ortho/para directing.
- tert-Butyl: It's a bulky, activating group, but since it's a tertiary butyl, it's also ortho/para directing. However, bulky groups can make para substitution more favorable sometimes because of steric hindrance.
- Nitro (NO2): A deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so any substitution after nitro would be difficult because nitro deactivates the ring. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, or earlier but in a position that allows the other groups to come in.

Wait, but looking at the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3. Let's think about the order of addition. Since nitro is a meta director, maybe it's better to introduce it after the other substituents because if it's introduced too early, it might complicate the positions where other groups can go.

Wait, but ethoxy and tert-butyl are both activating; nitro is deactivating. So if we introduce nitro after the other groups, it might be easier because the ring is still activated. Hmm, but nitro is meta-directing. Alternatively, if we add nitro first, then the subsequent substituents would be directed meta or para to it.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group last. Because if we add it first, then the next substituents would be added in positions relative to nitro, which is meta-directing. But let's think about the desired positions.

The target has substituents at 1,2,3. So ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Looking at their relative positions, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3, which are meta to each other. So maybe the nitro was introduced in such a way that it ends up at position 3 relative to the ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are to first introduce ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But let me think about the directing.

Wait, let's outline possible steps.

Option 1: Introduce ethoxy first.

Benzene → introduce ethoxy. Ethoxy is OEt, so it's an activating group. Then, when adding the next group (tert-butyl), since ethoxy is ortho/para-directing, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to it.

But wait, the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, which is adjacent (ortho). So if we add tert-butyl after ethoxy, it would go ortho to ethoxy.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so when you add substituents, their positions are relative. Let me imagine the ring: benzene with ethoxy at position 1. Then, when adding tert-butyl, the positions ortho to ethoxy are 2 and 6. But the target has tert-butyl at position 2. So perhaps after ethoxy, tert-butyl is introduced in the ortho position.

But wait, when you have a meta director, it complicates things. So, if I add tert-butyl second, after ethoxy, it would be ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, adding nitro third would be more challenging because nitro is deactivating, but perhaps the positions are set.

Wait, but the target structure is 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro. So, the nitro is at position 3. How to get there?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced via a nitration after another substituent. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the nitro group is introduced via the nitration reaction, which is a meta-directing electrophile. So, if we first have benzene with ethoxy, then nitrate, the nitro would go meta to ethoxy. But that would be position 3 if ethoxy is at 1. Wait, benzene positions are such that the meta positions are two away, so if ethoxy is at 1, nitro would go at 3 or 5 (meta). But if you have another substituent, like t-Bu, which is at 2, would that affect the nitration?

Wait, perhaps the reaction sequence is:

1. Ethylation: benzene → ethoxybenzene (anisole).

2. Nitration: nitro group is added meta to ethoxy, so at position 3.

3. Alkylation: introduce tert-butyl group.

Wait, but wait, after nitration, the ring is deactivating. So introducing another substituent via electrophilic substitution would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. So perhaps the nitro group should be introduced last.

So another possible sequence: first introduce ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, introducing ethoxy and t-Bu first, then nitro.

But wait, the t-Bu group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. So we can do ethoxylation first because ethoxy is activating.

So let's outline:

Step 1: Benzene → ethoxybenzene (using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 as catalyst).

Step 2: Ethoxybenzene → introduce tert-butyl group. Since ethoxy is ortho/para directing, t-Bu would go into ortho or para. But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1). So after adding ethoxy, t-Bu is added in the ortho position.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation can be tricky because tertiary alkyl chlorides are bulky and may not easily undergo electrophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the t-Bu group is introduced via a different method, like using t-Bu chloride and AlCl3. But AlCl3 is a Lewis catalyst for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can lead to carbocation rearrangements. For t-Bu, the carbocation is already very stable, so that's okay. So ethoxybenzene (step 1) is treated with t-BuCl and AlCl3. The t-Bu group would be added at the ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy.

But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2 (ortho) to ethoxy (position 1). So the alkylation would add t-Bu at ortho, making 2-(t-Bu)-ethoxybenzene. But wait, the ethoxy could be at position 1, and after alkylation, t-Bu is at 2.

But wait, benzene is symmetric. So, when you have ethoxy at position 1, the possible positions for t-Bu would be 2 or 6 (ortho) and 4 (para). So if the alkylation is directed to ortho, t-Bu could go to 2 or 6. But the target has t-Bu at 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy.

But wait, perhaps the nitration has to be done after alkylation. Let me see:

After alkylation, the ring has ethoxy (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2). Now, the next step is nitration. But the ring is activated because ethoxy is activating, but t-Bu is bulky. So where would the nitro group go?

The substituents are ethoxy (activating, OEt) at 1 and t-Bu (activating, but bulky) at 2. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution. The activating groups would direct incoming electrophiles.

But OEt is ortho/para directing, t-Bu is ortho/para. But where would the nitro go?

The ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. So possible positions for nitration are:

- Position 3: meta to ethoxy (but ethoxy is OEt, which is ortho/para, so meta isn't the main direction. Wait, but actually, the existing substituents will direct the incoming group.

Wait, the ring now has ethoxy (OEt) at 1 and t-Bu at 2. So the possible positions for nitration would be influenced by both groups. The ethoxy directs incoming groups to ortho (2 and 6) and para (4), and the t-Bu at 2 would also direct to ortho (1 and 3) and para (5). But positions 1 and 2 are already occupied.

Wait, maybe the nitro group goes into position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1). So the nitro would be at position 3. That would give the desired structure.

So the sequence would be:

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene (using ethyl chloride and AlCl3).

2. Ethoxybenzene → introduce t-Bu at position 2 via Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl and AlCl3.

3. Then, nitration would introduce the nitro group at position 3.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the ring is more activated, making nitration easier. But nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution; it's usually done under strongly acidic conditions (H2SO4, HNO3).

Wait, but in the presence of multiple substituents, the directing effect is a combination of their effects. So, in our case, ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. So the available positions are 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The ethoxy at 1 would prefer incoming groups at 2 (ortho), 4 (para), and 6 (ortho). The t-Bu at 2 would prefer 1 (ortho), 3 (ortho), and 5 (para).

Looking for overlapping preferred positions, position 3 is ortho to t-Bu and para to where? Wait, position 3 is meta to ethoxy. So ethoxy would direct to 2 (but occupied by t-Bu), 4 (para), and 6. But the t-Bu directs to 3 (ortho) and 5 (para).

So the most activated position would be where both substituents direct. But if position 3 is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy, perhaps it's not the most active. Alternatively, maybe the t-Bu's ortho (position 3) is more activating than the ethoxy's para (position 4).

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: each substituent has its own activating effect. The ethoxy is a strong activating group, so the positions it directs to are more activated. The t-Bu is also activating but less so than ethoxy? Or maybe not. Since both are activating, the combined effect would be to activate certain positions more than others.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So perhaps the nitration occurs after adding the ethoxy and t-Bu groups, and it goes into position 3 due to t-Bu directing.

Wait, but ethoxy is a stronger activating group than t-Bu? Maybe. So the ethoxy would have a greater influence on where the nitro group goes. If the nitro comes in meta to the ethoxy, that would be position 3 and 5. But position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu at 2. So nitration could go into position 3 because it's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added before the t-Bu.

Wait, let me think of another approach. The target has three substituents: OEt (1), t-Bu (2), and NO2 (3). So OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2 (ortho), and NO2 at 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to OEt).

So, making this step by step:

1. Introduce OEt.

2. Introduce t-Bu, ortho to OEt (position 2).

3. Introduce NO2, ortho to t-Bu (position 3).

But how would the substituents influence the direction of the nitration in step 3.

Wait, after having OEt (1) and t-Bu (2), the next substitution (nitration) could be directed by both groups.

OEt is ortho/para directing, t-Bu is ortho/para directing.

The available positions are 3,4,5,6.

t-Bu at 2 directs to 1 (taken), 3 (ortho), and 5 (para).

OEt at 1 directs to 2 (taken), 4 (para), and 6 (ortho).

So, position 3 is ortho to t-Bu and meta to OEt.

Position 4 is para to OEt and meta to t-Bu.

Position 5 is para to t-Bu and meta to OEt.

Position 6 is ortho to OEt and meta to t-Bu.

Which position is more activated? OEt is activating, so positions ortho and para to it are more reactive. Similarly, t-Bu is activating, so its ortho and para are reactive.

So, position 3 is ortho to t-Bu (activating) and meta to OEt (which is deactivating, but OEt is activating, so meta might not be as favored). Wait, no, OEt is activating, so its directing is ortho and para. So position 3 is not ortho or para to OEt; OEt is at 1, so position 3 is meta to it. So OEt would not direct to 3. But t-Bu is at 2, so position 3 is ortho to t-Bu.

So, the nitro group would be directed by t-Bu to position 3.

Alternatively, OEt is a stronger activating group, so maybe the nitration is more influenced by OEt, but OEt doesn't direct to position 3.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would end up at position 3 because it's the most activated position, given both substituents.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible reaction steps.

Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced in a position that's meta to one substituent and ortho to another. So maybe the order is to introduce OEt first, then nitro, then t-Bu. Let's see:

1. Benzene → OEt (ethoxy) at position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to OEt).

3. Alkylation (t-Bu) → can it go to position 2, which is ortho to OEt and adjacent to nitro?

But after nitration, the ring has OEt (1) and NO2 (3). Now, the OEt is activating (ortho/para), and NO2 is deactivating (meta).

So the next substitution (t-Bu) would be directed by the activating groups. OEt is activating, so the t-Bu would go ortho or para to OEt.

OEt is at 1: ortho positions are 2 and 6; para is 4.

But the nitro group is at 3, which is adjacent to position 4. So, t-Bu would prefer position 2 (ortho to OEt) because it's less hindered, perhaps.

Thus, after nitration, t-Bu is added at position 2, ortho to OEt (1). That would give the desired structure.

Wait, but in this scenario, the nitration is done before alkylation. Let me think about that.

In this approach:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene (step 1: nitro at position 1, but wait, no: benzene is symmetric, so the position of nitro would be arbitrary, but let's say position 1.

2. Then alkylation with ethoxy to add OEt. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so alkylation would be difficult. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. So maybe this approach is not feasible. Because after nitration, the ring is deactivated. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation would not proceed easily.

So that's a problem. So, nitration after Friedel-Crafts is better, because then the ring is still activated.

So let's go back to the earlier idea: OEt first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

After OEt and t-Bu are added, nitration would be possible.

Wait, but when you have OEt and t-Bu in the ring, introducing nitro as the last step would be possible because the ring remains activated (since both OEt and t-Bu are activating groups). Although, in reality, the presence of multiple substituents can complicate the direction.

So, let's outline the steps again.

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene (OEt at position 1) via Friedel-Crafts (ethyl chloride, AlCl3).

2. Ethoxybenzene → introduce t-Bu. Since OEt is ortho/para, t-Bu can go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Let's assume it goes to position 2.

3. Now, the ring has OEt (1) and t-Bu (2). Next, nitration.

The nitration would be directed by both substituents. OEt directs to ortho (2,6) and para (4), but 2 and 6 are near t-Bu. t-Bu directs to ortho (1,3) and para (5). So possible nitration positions are 3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2). So in the presence of both OEt and t-Bu, the nitro would go to position 3.

So that would give the desired structure: OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

But how do I get the nitro at position 3? Because OEt is at 1, which is a strong activating group. So the nitration would be more influenced by OEt. Wait, no: OEt is at 1, and nitro group is added meta to OEt, which would be position 3 and 5. But t-Bu is at 2, so position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu and meta to OEt. So perhaps the nitration occurs at position 3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the directing effects again.

Another point: the presence of multiple substituents can lead to competition in directing the incoming electrophile. The most activating group will have a stronger influence. So, OEt is more activating than t-Bu (since OEt is an electron-donating group via resonance, while t-Bu is an electron-donating via induction but not resonance). So OEt is a stronger activating group.

So, in the presence of both OEt and t-Bu, the nitration would be more influenced by OEt.

Wait, but OEt is in position 1, so the para position is 4, and the meta positions are 3 and 5. So the nitro group could go to 3 or 5.

But the target has nitro at 3. So perhaps the nitro is introduced into position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. OEt is added first.

2. Nitro is added next, meta to OEt, at position 3.

3. Then t-Bu is added, ortho to OEt, at position 2.

But wait, after nitro is added, the ring has OEt (1) and NO2 (3). Now, adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating group. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation would not proceed easily. So maybe this approach is not feasible.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct order is:

OEt → t-Bu → nitro.

But I'm not sure about the positions. Let me think about the steps in the options.

Looking at the options, each option has a sequence of reactions. Let me look at option D:

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction or something else. Wait, Fe and HCl is for something else. Wait, Fe in HCl is often for converting nitro groups to amino groups, but I'm not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation?

vii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a Williamson ether synthesis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has ethoxy (OEt), so maybe that's introduced via an ether formation. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, like using NaOH and an ethyl bromide, but that would require a leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe a nucleophilic substitution after some activation.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should analyze each option step by step.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → alkylation (Friedel-Crafts). So benzene → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxylation via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Wait, this seems like a lot of steps. Let me see: after step i, benzene becomes t-Bu benzene. Then nitration would add nitro at meta to t-Bu, which is positions 3,5, etc. Then sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating group. But then step iv is diazotization, which requires an amine. So perhaps step iii is not possible because the ring is deactivated, making further substitution difficult.

This seems messy. Maybe option A is not the right path.

Option B:

i) t-Bu chloride/AlCl3 → alkylation.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe converts nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

This also seems complicated. After step i, t-Bu benzene. Step ii, nitrate → nitro at meta to t-Bu, say position 3. Then Fe/HCl would reduce nitro to amine. Then nitrate again? That might not make sense. Then diazotization, which would require amine.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

t-Bu benzene → nitration → nitro at 3 → reduce nitro to amine at 3 → then diazotization → introduce something else. But I'm not sure.

Option C:

i) t-Bu chloride → alkylation.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration again.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

This also seems complicated. Sulfonation would add a strong deactivating group early on, which might prevent further substitution.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-Bu chloride → alkylation.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

Wait, this seems to involve multiple nitrations and reductions. Let's think through it.

Step i: benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1, but actually any position since benzene is symmetric).

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So now, aniline.

Step iii: alkylation with t-BuCl/AlCl3. Aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would go ortho/para to amine.

But after that, step iv: nitration again. Amine is a strong activating group, so nitro would go ortho/para to amine.

But this seems like it's adding multiple groups, but I'm not sure how it would end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different mechanism, like a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, looking back, the target molecule has an ethoxy group. How is that introduced? It could be introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using ethyl chloride and AlCl3), but if the ring is already deactivated, that won't work. Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, using a nitration step followed by a diazotization, then a substitution with ethanol.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. For example, after introducing a nitro group and a leaving group, then substituting with ethanol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using NaOH and ethyl bromide, but this usually requires a good leaving group already attached to the ring, such as a nitro group being converted into a diazonium salt and then replaced.

Wait, but in that case, the steps would involve:

1. Introduce nitro group.

2. Convert nitro to diazonium salt.

3. Replace with ethoxy group via diazonium salt substitution.

But let me think about the target molecule. It has an ethoxy group at position 1, nitro at 3, t-Bu at 2.

So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is in place. So:

- Nitro group is at 3.

- Then, ethoxy is introduced via substitution at position 1.

But that would require the nitro group to be at 3, and then position 1 would be adjacent to nitro? How would that substitution happen?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation after some substituents are present.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis, which involves an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide. But for that, the ring would need a leaving group, which is generally not present unless activated.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct order of reactions in the options.

Looking at the options again:

The correct target has OEt, t-Bu, and NO2 in positions 1, 2, and 3.

Which of the options' steps would lead to that?

Looking for steps that introduce OEt, t-Bu, and NO2 in the correct order and positions.

Option D: steps i to ix.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at some position.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu would add to ring, directed by amine (which is activating, ortho/para).

iv) Nitrate again → nitro would add directed by amine and t-Bu.

Wait, this seems like it's adding multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

But the target has only one nitro group. So Option D probably isn't correct.

Option B:

i) Alkylation with t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitrate again.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Acid workup.

vii) Ethoxylation.

viii) Sulfonate.

ix) Dilute H2SO4.

Not sure.

Option C:

i) Alkylation with t-Bu.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Nitrate again.

vii) Acid.

viii) Dilute H2SO4.

ix) Ethoxylation.

Hmm, again, not seeing the correct steps.

Option A:

i) Alkylation with t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) Sulfonate.

iv) Diazotize.

v) Dilute H2SO4.

vi) Acid.

vii) Ethoxylation.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) Nitrate.

This seems like a lot of sulfonating, which might deactivate the ring, making further substitution difficult.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, let me think about each option's steps more carefully.

Looking at Option B:

i) Alkylation with t-Bu → benzene → t-Bu-benzene.

ii) Nitrate → adds nitro at meta to t-Bu (positions 3 and 5).

Assuming nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So now, we have t-Bu at 2 and amine at 3.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro group would be added where? The amine is activating, so nitro would go ortho/para to amine. The ring already has t-Bu at 2 and amine at 3.

So, possible positions for nitration are ortho (2 and 4) and para (6) to amine.

But position 2 is already occupied by t-Bu, so nitro could go to 4 or 6.

But the target has nitro at 3, which is impossible since it's already replaced by amine.

Wait, no, in step iii, the nitro was reduced to amine, so in step iv, another nitration occurs. But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is another one.

Alternatively, perhaps Option C:

i) Alkylation with t-Bu → t-Bu at position 2 (assuming OEt is at 1, but OEt is introduced later).

Wait, perhaps the correct order is OEt, t-Bu, nitro.

Which option introduces OEt, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Looking for that.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce to amine.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu would go to ortho or para of amine.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro group? Not sure.

Not the right approach.

Option B's step vii is NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxylation via SN2, but that would require a good leaving group.

So, if after some steps, the ring has a bromine which can be replaced by ethoxide.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution.

Looking at the options, the only options with NaOH and EtBr are options A (vii), B (vii), C (ix), D (ix).

So, perhaps in one of these options, after a nitro group is introduced, it's converted to a diazonium salt, then replaced with ethoxy.

Wait, that's a possibility.

The general steps for introducing an ethoxy group via diazonium salt substitution would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize (NaNO2/HCl) → diazonium chloride.

4. Replace diazonium group with ethoxy (using EtBr and NaOH).

So perhaps that's part of the reaction steps.

But let's see if any of the options follow that.

Looking at option B's steps:

i) Alkylation → t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (3-amino-t-Bu benzene).

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro group somewhere else, which we don't want.

Hmm, not matching.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro.

Not helpful.

Option C:

i) Alkylation → t-Bu.

ii) Sulfonate → adds SO3H group.

iii) Nitrate → nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → amine.

v) Diazotize → diazonium.

vi) Nitrate → another nitro.

Not helpful.

Option A:

i) Alkylation → t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro.

iii) Sulfonate.

iv) Diazotize → requires amine, but step iii added sulfonate, which is deactivating, so probably not.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro.

v) Diazotize → requires amine.

vi) Sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4 → ?

viii) Acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation via SN2.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced in step ix.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the desired structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is in place.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction.

Let me think: the target has OEt, t-Bu, and NO2.

If the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, then perhaps the nitro group is already present. Then, the ethoxy replaces a nitro group.

Wait, let me think of a possible sequence.

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Alkylation → introduce t-Bu. Aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu will go ortho or para to amine.

4. Diazotization → convert amine to diazonium salt.

5. Replace diazonium with ethoxy group (using ethanol or ethoxide).

6. Then, another nitration to add a nitro group in the correct position.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation after the nitro group is in place. But that would require the ring to be activated, which it isn't if there's a nitro group.

So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced before the nitro.

But then, the nitro would have to be added after, but the ring would still be activated.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 3, which is meta to ethoxy at 1. So nitration after ethoxy introduction would add nitro at meta.

But wait, if ethoxy is at 1, and t-Bu at 2, then nitro would be at 3.

So the steps would be:

1. Benzene → OEt (ethoxy) via Friedel-Crafts.

2. OEt benzene → t-Bu (ortho to OEt) via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Now, with OEt (1) and t-Bu (2), nitrate → nitro goes to position 3.

Which would give the desired structure.

But do any of the options follow this sequence?

Looking at the options, which ones have OEt and t-Bu introduced before nitration.

The options don't directly show this. Let me look again.

Looking for steps where OEt is introduced first, then t-Bu, then nitration.

Looking at the options, none of them explicitly include OEt introduction before t-Bu. Wait, perhaps OEt is introduced via a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps OEt is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. For example, after a nitro is present, then replaced with OEt.

Alternatively, OEt could be introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which is step i in some options.

Looking at option D, step iii is alkylation (t-BuCl), but before that, nitro and amine steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the target has three substituents. Let's think about the order in which they are added.

The ethoxy group is an activating group, so it's better to add it early. The nitro group is deactivating, so better to add it later. The t-Bu group is also activating but bulky, so perhaps added after ethoxy.

So the correct sequence is OEt → t-Bu → nitro.

Now, finding which option has OEt introduced before t-Bu and nitro.

Looking at the options:

Option C: steps i) t-Bu, ii) SO3, iii) nitrate, iv) Fe, etc. No OEt.

Option D: steps i) nitrate, ii) Fe, iii) t-Bu, iv) nitrate. Not OEt first.

Option B: steps i) t-Bu, ii) nitrate, iii) Fe, etc. No OEt.

Option A: steps i) t-Bu, ii) nitrate, iii) SO3, etc. No OEt.

Hmm, none of the options seem to have OEt introduced before t-Bu and nitro.

Wait, perhaps OEt is introduced via a different method, like a substitution reaction after nitration.

Wait, but for substitution, the ring needs a good leaving group. That is usually achieved by having a nitro group, which can be reduced to an amine, then diazotized to a diazonium salt, and then replaced with another group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitro group.

2. Reduce nitro to amine.

3. Diazotize → form diazonium salt.

4. Replace with ethoxy group.

5. Then, introduce t-Bu and another nitro group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but after other substituents are in place. But then, the ring might be deactivated, making FC difficult.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group and a leaving group, such as a nitro group which is then converted to a diazonium salt.

So:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitro group (position 1).

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline (position 1).

3. Diazotize → form diazonium salt.

4. Substitute with ethoxide → OEt at position 1.

5. Now, introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts (since ring is activated by OEt).

6. Then, nitrate to add NO2 at position 3.

But wait, this would require nitration after OEt is in place.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if any of the options follow this.

Perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro?

v) Diazotize → amine again.

vi) Sulfonate.

vii) H2SO4.

viii) Acid.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the correct structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B's steps:

i) Alkylation with t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro somewhere else.

v) Diazotize → amine.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) Dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the nitro group is introduced via a different position based on the directing effects of the substituents already present. So, perhaps the order is OEt → nitro → t-Bu.

Let me think about that.

1. Benzene → OEt (position 1) via FC.

2. OEt benzene → nitrate → nitro at position 3 (meta to OEt).

3. Now, the ring has OEt (1) and nitro (3). Introducing t-Bu would be challenging because the ring is deactivated by nitro.

So, maybe this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: the ethoxy group is introduced after nitration and alkylation. But nitro deactivates the ring, making FC alkylation difficult.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about each option's steps in detail.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu adds to ring, ortho/para to amine.

iv) Nitrate → another nitro group.

v) Diazotize → form diazonium.

vi) Sulfonate → add SO3H.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) Acid → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via SN2 in step ix, replacing a bromide. But how would bromide be present?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is converted to a leaving group.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B's steps:

i) Alkylation → t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro at position 5.

v) Diazotize → amine at 5.

vi) Acid → hydrolysis of diazo?

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

viii) Sulfonate.

ix) Dilute H2SO4.

Not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about the possible substituents and their introduction.

The target is 2-(t-Bu)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at 1,2,3 in a row.

So, OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the order of introduction could be OEt → t-Bu → nitro.

Which would mean the steps are:

1. FC alkylation with ethyl chloride → OEt at 1.

2. FC alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu at 2 (ortho to OEt).

3. Nitration → nitro at 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to OEt).

Looking for an option where OEt is introduced first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But looking at the options, none of them have OEt introduced before t-Bu. All options' first steps are either nitration or alkylation with t-Bu.

Wait, perhaps the OEt is introduced via a different reaction, like a substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps OEt is introduced via a substitution using a diazonium salt.

So:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitro (position 1).

2. Reduce nitro to amine → amine at 1.

3. Diazotize → diazonium at 1.

4. Substitute with ethoxide → OEt at 1.

Now, the ring has OEt at 1.

5. FC alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu at 2 (ortho to OEt).

6. Nitration → nitro at 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to OEt).

So the steps would be: nitrate → reduce → diazo → substitute → alkylation → nitrate.

Looking at the options, which one follows this order.

Looking at option B:

i) Alkylation → t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe → reduce.

iv) Nitrate → nitro.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Acid.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

Hmm, not matching.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe → reduce.

iii) Alkylation → t-Bu.

iv) Nitrate → nitro.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Sulfonate.

vii) Dilute H2SO4.

viii) Acid.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

So, step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: alkylation → t-Bu at ortho or para to amine. Suppose t-Bu at 2.

Step iv: nitrate → nitro where? The ring has OEt (from step ix?), no. Wait, step ix is ethoxylation.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxylation is done after step v.

Step v: diazotize.

Step vi: sulfonate → adds SO3H.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis?

Step viii: acid → ?

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

This is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Because after step iii, the ring has t-Bu and amine. Then step iv nitrate would add nitro in a position directed by amine and t-Bu.

But I'm not confident.

Another approach: the correct option should have the ethoxy group introduced via a substitution reaction, perhaps via NaOH and EtBr, which is step vii or ix in some options.

So, let's look for an option where NaOH/EtBr is used after a nitro group is present.

Looking at option B:

step vii: NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

So, if step vii is ethoxylation, then before that, the ring must have a nitro group which is then converted.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option B are:

i) Alkylation → t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe → reduce nitro to amine at 3.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro at 5.

v) Diazotize → amine at 5.

vi) Acid → hydrolysis to something.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation at position 1.

viii) Sulfonate → adds SO3H.

ix) Dilute H2SO4 → ?

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Alternatively, perhaps option B's steps are:

i) t-BuCl → alkylation.

ii) nitration → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe → amine at 3.

iv) nitrate → nitro at another position.

v) diazotize → amine.

vi) acid → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

viii) sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should guess that the correct option is B.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, another plan: the target molecule has an ethoxy group. How is that introduced?

In option D, step ix is NaOH/EtBr, which is likely a nucleophilic substitution. So, perhaps the ring has a bromine that is replaced by OEt.

So, in option D's steps:

After step viii: H3O+ and heat, perhaps a substitution occurs.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how the steps lead to the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the possible steps. The correct sequence likely involves introducing OEt first, then t-Bu, then nitro. But none of the options directly show this. Alternatively, perhaps OEt is introduced via substitution after nitro is present.

Given the confusion, I'll go with option D as the correct answer, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, has three substituents: an ethoxy group (OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (t-Bu) at position 2, and a nitro group (NO₂) at position 3. The substituents are positioned in a row (1, 2, 3) on the benzene ring. The synthesis must account for the directing effects of each group and ensure high yield.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Directing Effects**:
   - Ethoxy (OEt): Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - tert-Butyl (t-Bu): Activating, ortho/para-directing, but bulky.
   - Nitro (NO₂): Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Order of Introduction**:
   - Ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating groups, so they are better introduced early when the ring is still reactive.
   - Nitro is deactivating, so it is better introduced later when the desired positions are already occupied by activating groups.

3. **Target Structure**:
   - Ethoxy at position 1.
   - tert-Butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).
   - Nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl).

4. **Reaction Sequence**:
   - **Step 1**: Introduce ethoxy (OEt) via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   - **Step 2**: Introduce tert-butyl (t-Bu) via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, directed ortho to ethoxy.
   - **Step 3**: Introduce nitro (NO₂) via nitration, directed meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, sulfonation, and other steps. This sequence does not align with the desired positions of the substituents.
   - **Option B**: Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, reduction, and other steps. This sequence does not clearly establish the ethoxy group in the correct position.
   - **Option C**: Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by sulfonation, nitration, and other steps. Sulfonation introduces a strong deactivating group early, complicating subsequent reactions.
   - **Option D**: Begins with nitration, followed by reduction, tert-butyl alkylation, and other steps. This sequence does not clearly establish the ethoxy group in the correct position.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions should prioritize the introduction of ethoxy and tert-butyl groups early, followed by nitration. However, none of the options explicitly follow this ideal sequence. Based on the analysis, **Option D** is the most plausible, as it aligns closer with the required transformations, even though the reasoning is not fully clear.
