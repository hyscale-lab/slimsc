Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what I know.

The problem says: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm. So, I remember that when dealing with electrostatic potential energy, the formula is something like U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But wait, this is for the potential energy between two point charges. But in this case, I have multiple charges. How does that work?

Wait, right, for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But calculating that for 13 charges would be a lot. Oh, wait, but the setup here is specific. Twelve charges are at a fixed distance from point P, and the 13th is at P. So, maybe I can break it down.

Let me think. The charge at point P is fixed, so it doesn't move. The other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge at P. So, the potential energy contributions are between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and also between the 12 moving charges themselves.

But wait, the problem says to find the minimum energy. So, perhaps I should think about how the system's potential energy can be minimized. Since all the moving charges are identical and have the same charge, and since like charges repel, maybe their configuration would tend to spread out as much as possible to minimize the potential energy? Or wait, no, wait—wait, wait. Wait, for potential energy, the system's minimum would be when the charges are as far apart as possible because the potential energy between like charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the total potential energy.

But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So perhaps they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters centered at P? But if they are constrained, maybe they can't move closer to each other. Hmm, but regardless, for the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, that's straightforward. The fixed charge is 2e, each of the 12 is also 2e, and the distance is 2 meters. So each of those 12 contributes a certain amount to the potential energy.

But wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps I should calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, no. The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So, each pair contributes, and I have to account for all possible pairs.

Let me think. The total potential energy U is given by the sum over all pairs of (k * q1 * q2) / r. So, in this case, we have two types of pairs: those between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12, and those between each pair of the 12 charges.

So, the first part is 12 pairs (since there are 12 charges at 2m from P), each with charges 2e and 2e, and distance 2m.

The second part is the combinations of the 12 charges taken two at a time. Since all 12 are identical and at the same distance from each other? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if all 12 charges are constrained to be at 2m from P, their arrangement could be on the surface of a sphere. But the distance between any two of them depends on their positions on the sphere. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible, which would be when they are equally spaced on the sphere. But wait, how does that affect the distance between them? Hmm. But wait, the potential energy for each pair of the 12 would then depend on the actual distance between them, which isn't fixed because it depends on their arrangement. But in the problem, are the 12 charges fixed at 2m from P, but are they free to move on the sphere? Or are they fixed in some way that their mutual distances are fixed?

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So, their distance from P is fixed, but their positions relative to each other can vary as long as they remain 2m from P. So, to find the minimum potential energy, the 12 charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Since all have the same charge, which is positive (since it's 2e, e being the elementary charge), the charges would repel each other, so to minimize the potential energy, they should be placed as far apart as possible. That would mean they form a regular dodecahedron or something on the sphere, but the exact arrangement isn't given. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is fixed because their positions are constrained, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps their positions are fixed on the sphere, so their mutual distances are fixed as well. But that's not necessarily the case. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem wants me to assume that all 12 are at a single point, but that can't be because they are identical charges and would repel each other. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same, but that's only possible if they form a regular polyhedron on the sphere, but the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the situation by considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge. Maybe it's considering that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is negligible or is not contributing to the minimum. Or perhaps the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, but their positions are such that their mutual distances are something else, but the problem isn't giving me that information, so maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the mutual potential between the 12 charges is zero or not part of the calculation. Hmm.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem states it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered. So, I must include the potential energy between the 12 charges as well. But without knowing their exact positions relative to each other, perhaps the problem assumes that their mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. But that can't be right because if all 12 charges were on a sphere of radius 2m, each pair's distance would be larger than 2m, depending on their positions. Alternatively, maybe the mutual distances can be considered as the same as the distance from P, but that would only be the case if all the charges are at the same point, which isn't possible because they repel each other.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and then considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered to be zero because their arrangement is such that they're equally spaced and the potential energy is symmetric, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, the potential energy for a system of charges in a symmetric arrangement can sometimes be calculated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges and only calculate the potential energy between each of them and the fixed charge. That would make the calculation straightforward.

Wait, but let's see. Let me think: the potential energy between two charges is k * q1 q2 / r.

In this case, the fixed charge is 2e. Each of the 12 is 2e, and the distance is 2m.

So, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m).

So, for one charge: U1 = k * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution from the fixed charge and all 12 is 12 * U1.

Wait, but wait, potential energy is a scalar quantity, and when you have multiple pairs, each pair contributes their own U. So, the fixed charge and each of the 12: that's 12 pairs.

Each pair contributes k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e² / m.

So 12 pairs: 12 * (2k e² / m) = 24 k e² / m.

But wait, then what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since each of the 12 has a charge of 2e and are at some distance apart, I think I can't ignore that. But if I don't know the distances between them, how can I calculate that?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all placed on the surface of a sphere at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are 2m as well. That can't be the case unless all 12 are at the same point, which they can't be because of their repulsion. So that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is approximated as 2m, making the potential energy between each pair U = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = same as before. But how many such pairs are there?

Wait, but wait, the 12 charges are on the sphere, so the number of pairs among them is C(12,2) = (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs.

If each pair has a distance of 2m, then each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = same as before.

So, the mutual energy between the 12 charges would be 66 * (2k e²)/(2m) = 66 * (2k e²)/(2m) = 66 * (k e²/m).

Wait, but wait, each mutual pair is 2e and 2e, so U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(r), where r is the distance between them. If I take r as 2m, then U for each pair is 4k e²/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So, for 66 pairs, that's 66 * 2k e²/m = 132 k e²/m.

But wait, but I'm not sure if the mutual distances are 2m. Because if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between two charges on the sphere's surface would be more than 2m. For example, if two charges are on opposite ends of a diameter, their distance is 4m. So, the average distance would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. But that seems unlikely because the problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are arranged in a way that their repulsions balance each other, but that doesn't make sense because they're all identical and repel each other. So, that would require a specific arrangement, but the problem doesn't state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's minimum energy is achieved when the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they repel each other. So, the minimal energy would actually be when they are as far apart as possible, but without knowing their exact arrangement, the problem must be making some assumption.

Wait, maybe the question only considers the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and ignores the mutual potential among the 12. Because if you don't have any information about their arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore that part. Let me see what the options are. The options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, but let's calculate the energy as if only the fixed charge and the 12 contribute, and the mutual energy of the 12 is zero. So, the total energy would be 12 pairs each contributing k*(2e)^2/(2m).

Let me compute that. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct, but let's proceed and see.

First, let's compute the value.

Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs.

So, each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

The distance r is 2 meters.

So for one pair (fixed and one of the 12), U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m).

Compute that:

= (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2 * 2)
Wait, no, wait, 2e is the charge of each, so it's (2e) * (2e) = 4e². And the denominator is 2m (since r is 2m).

So, U per pair = (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (2 * 2).

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So, 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.026e-37 C².

Then, multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = (8.988 * 1.026) * 1e9-37 = approximately (9.23) * 1e-28 = 9.23e-28.

Then, divide by (2 * 2) =4: 9.23e-28 / 4 = 2.3075e-28 J.

So each pair contributes about 2.3075e-28 J.

Since there are 12 such pairs (the fixed charge and each of the 12), total U1 = 12 * 2.3075e-28 = approx 2.769e-27 J.

But wait, that's only considering the fixed charge and the 12. However, if the mutual energy between the 12 charges isn't zero, that would add more to the total energy.

But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So, perhaps I should also consider the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore that part, or perhaps there's a simplification.

Wait, maybe the mutual potential energy is not considered because the problem states that the 12 charges are "constrained to stay" at 2m from P, which might imply that their positions are fixed relative to P, so their mutual distances are fixed as well, but then the problem would have to give more information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual potential energy because it's either considered negligible or it's not part of the problem's scope.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's compute what I have so far: 2.769e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 5.645e-26 J, which is about 22.5 times larger than my current 2.769e-27.

Option B: 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10.2 times larger than my current value.

Option C: 7.056e-27 J, which is a little higher than my 2.769e-27.

Option D is about 122.33, which is way larger, so probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the per-pair energy.

Wait, each pair is U = k * (2e)^2 / (2m). Let me compute that again.

So, k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19 C)^2 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-38) = approx 10.266e-38 C².

Then, U = (8.988e9) * (10.266e-38) / (2*2).

Wait, 8.988e9 * 10.266e-38 = 8.988 * 10.266 * 1e-28.

8.988 * 10.266 is approximately 92.3. So, 92.3e-28 J.

Divide by 4 (since denominator is 4): 92.3e-28 /4 = 23.075e-28 J, which is 2.3075e-27 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.3075e-27 = 2.769e-26 J?

Wait, wait no, 2.3075e-27 J per pair, times 12 is 27.69e-27 J = 2.769e-26 J. Oh, I think I messed up the exponent.

Wait, 2.3075e-27 J per pair, times 12 is (2.3075 * 12) = 27.69, so 27.69e-27 J = 2.769e-26 J.

Wait, so this would be 2.769e-26 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is close to this. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But wait, I'm not considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. If I include that, it would add more energy, making the total higher. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energy is zero, which can't be right because like charges repel, so the potential energy between them should be positive.

Wait, no, wait: the potential energy between two like charges is positive. So, if I have 12 charges, all positive, the sum of their mutual potential energies would be positive, adding to the total. So, the total potential energy would be U = U_fixed_12 + U_12_mutual.

But the problem asks for the minimum energy. So, the system's minimum energy would be the sum of the fixed charge interactions and the mutual interactions. But if I don't consider the mutual interactions, then the energy is lower, but that's not physically correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero because the charges are constrained in such a way that their mutual distances don't contribute. Or perhaps the problem says that the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual arrangement is such that their mutual potential energy is zero, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy, considering only the potential between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge. So, the total energy is 12 * U_pair, where U_pair is k*(2e)^2/(2m).

Wait, but I computed that as approximately 2.769e-26 J, which is close to option B: 2.822e-26 J.

But let me compute the exact value more precisely.

Let me compute (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602176634e-19)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = 10.2648e-38 C².

So, U per pair:

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So, U = (8.98755e9) * (10.2648e-38) / (4) [since r=2m, denominator is 2 * 2 =4].

Compute numerator: 8.98755e9 * 10.2648e-38 = let's compute 8.98755e9 * 10.2648e-38.

First, multiply 8.98755 * 10.2648 ≈ 92.3.

So, 92.3e-28. Then divide by 4: 92.3e-28 /4 = 23.075e-28 = 2.3075e-27 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.3075e-27 = 2.769e-26 J.

Wait, but option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit higher. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is minimized, which would be when they are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the fixed charge and the 12 charges' contributions, but ignores the mutual parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero because all the 12 charges are moving freely and have zero potential energy among themselves. But that can't be correct because like charges repel each other, so the potential energy should be positive.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the problem statement, considering only the potential between the fixed charge and the 12, and see what the answer is.

In that case, the total energy is 12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)).

Wait, but let me recalculate that more accurately.

Let me compute each step precisely.

Compute (2e)^2:

2e = 2 * 1.602176634e-19 C = 3.204353268e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = ?

3.204353268 squared is approximately 10.2648. So,

(3.204353268e-19)^2 = 10.2648e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So, U for one pair:

U = (8.9875517879e9) * (10.2648e-38) / (2 * 2)

= (8.9875517879e9 * 10.2648e-38) /4.

Compute numerator:

8.9875517879e9 = 8.9875517879 * 1e9.

10.2648e-38 = 1.02648e-37.

So, 8.9875517879e9 * 1.02648e-37 = 8.9875517879 * 1.02648 * 1e-28.

8.98755 * 1.02648 ≈ 9.23.

So, 9.23e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.23e-28 /4 = 2.3075e-28 J.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.3075e-28 = 2.769e-27 J.

Wait, that's 2.769e-27 J, which is option C: 7.056e-27? No, that's way higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy with the fixed charge, but it's a system of 13 charges. So, the total number of pairs is 13 * 12 / 2? No, no, no. Wait, no, because the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are moving. So, the pairs are between the 13th and each of the 12, so 12 pairs. So, the per-pair calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 8.98755e9 * 10.2648e-38.

Compute 8.98755e9 = 8.98755 * 1e9.

10.2648e-38 = 1.02648 * 1e-37.

Multiply 8.98755 * 1.02648:

8 * 1.02648 = 8.21184.

0.98755 * 1.02648 ≈ approx 1.014.

So, total approx 8.21184 + 1.014 = 9.22584.

So, 9.22584 * 1e9 * 1e-37 = 9.22584e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.22584e-28 /4 = 2.30646e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.30646e-28 = 27.6775e-28 J = 2.76775e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times larger than this.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that all 13 charges are contributing to the potential energy, including the mutual interactions between all pairs, including the fixed charge and the 12, and all pairs among the 12.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed, so it doesn't move, but the others are moving. So, the total potential energy is:

U = sum of all pairs between the fixed charge and the 12, plus sum of all pairs among the 12.

So, U = U1 + U2.

U1 is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (k*(4e²))/(2m) = 12 * (2k e²/m) = 24k e²/m.

U2 is the sum of all pairs among the 12. The number of pairs is C(12,2) =66. Each pair contributes k*(2e)^2/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute r_ij for each pair. So, perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as from the fixed charge, i.e., 2m. That would make each mutual pair contribute the same as the fixed and each moving pair.

So, U2 = 66 * k*(2e)^2/(2m) = 66 * (k *4e²)/(2m) = 66 * (2k e²/m) = 132 k e²/m.

So, total U = U1 + U2 = (24 + 132)*k e²/m = 156 k e²/m.

Let me compute this.

Compute k e²:

k = 8.98755e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.566969934e-38 C².

k e² = 8.98755e9 * 2.566969934e-38 = let's compute that.

8.98755e9 * 2.566969934e-38 = 8.98755 * 2.566969934 * 1e-28.

8.98755 * 2.56697 ≈ 23.07.

So, 23.07e-28 = 2.307e-27 J·m.

Now, 156 * (2.307e-27 / m) * (1/m) ? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the denominator is m (since r=2m), but in the calculation of U, it's 2m. So, each term is (k e²) / (2m), but when we computed U1 and U2, we included 2m in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

U = 156 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

Which is:

156 * (8.98755e9 * (3.204353268e-19)^2) / (2 * 2).

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

(2e)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 ≈ 1.02648e-37 C².

So, 8.98755e9 * 1.02648e-37 = 8.98755 * 1.02648e-28 ≈ 9.225e-28 J·m.

Divide by (2*2 m) → 4 m.

So, each term is 9.225e-28 /4 = 2.306e-28 J.

Multiply by 156: 156 * 2.306e-28 = 359.83e-28 = 3.5983e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26 J, which is higher than this. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is lower than 3.598e-26.

Hmm, that's not matching. So, perhaps the mutual potential is not considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense, but let's see.

If only U1 is considered, U = 2.769e-26 J, which is close to option B: 2.822e-26 J.

But why the discrepancy? Let me think about the exact calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything more accurately.

Compute (2e)^2:

(2e) = 2 * 1.602176634e-19 C = 3.204353268e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = 10.26481181e-38 C².

So, U per pair (fixed and each of the 12):

U = k * (2e)^2 / (2m) = (8.9875517879e9) * 10.26481181e-38 / (4).

Compute numerator: 8.9875517879e9 * 10.26481181e-38 = ?

Compute 8.9875517879e9 = 8.9875517879 * 1e9.

10.26481181e-38 = 1.026481181e-37.

Multiply together: 8.9875517879 * 1.026481181 = ?

Let me compute:

8 * 1.02648 = 8.21184.

0.98755 * 1.02648 = approx 1.014.

So total approx 8.21184 + 1.014 = 9.22584.

So, 9.22584e-28 J·m.

Divide by 4 (m): 9.22584e-28 /4 = 2.30646e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.30646e-28 = 2.76775e-27 J.

Wait, but that's 2.76775e-27 J, which is option C: 7.056e-27? No, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute 8.98755e9 multiplied by 10.26481181e-38.

8.98755e9 = 8.98755 * 1e9.

10.2648e-38 = 1.02648 * 1e-37.

(8.98755 * 1e9) * (1.02648 * 1e-37) = 8.98755 * 1.02648 * 1e9 * 1e-37.

Which is 8.98755 * 1.02648 * 1e-28.

Compute 8.98755 * 1.02648 ≈ 9.2258.

So, 9.2258e-28 J·m.

Divide by 4 m: 9.2258e-28 /4 = 2.30645e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.30645e-28 *12 = 2.76774e-27 J.

So, 2.76774e-27 J. None of the options match this exactly. The closest option is B: 2.822e-26 J, but that's an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, 2.7677e-27 J is 0.27677e-26 J, which is approximately 0.277e-26 J. So, none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each charge is 2e, so 2 times the elementary charge, but perhaps I'm using the wrong value. Let me check.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C. So 2e is 3.204e-19 C, correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the distance as 2 meters, but I used 2m as 2 meters, which is correct.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9 instead of the precise 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k = 9e9 N·m²/C².

Then, U per pair:

(9e9) * (10.2648e-38) /4.

= (9e9 *1.02648e-37) /4.

9e9 *1.02648e-37 = 9 *1.02648e-28 = 9.2383e-28.

Divide by 4: 2.3096e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.3096e-28 = 2.7715e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all 13 charges contribute to the potential energy, including the mutual pairs between the moving charges. But in that case, as I calculated earlier, the total would be around 3.598e-26 J, which is higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, but using a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system is the work required to assemble the charges, bringing each charge from infinity to its position. So, for the fixed charge at P, bringing it from infinity to P requires no work because it's fixed. Then, bringing each of the 12 charges from infinity to their positions would contribute U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) for each, as computed.

But then, what about the mutual potential energy among the 12 charges? When you bring each charge to its position, you have to consider the potential due to the other charges already present.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong earlier. Let me think about this.

The correct way to compute the potential energy of the system is to bring each charge one by one, calculating the work done against the electric field created by the already placed charges.

So, for the first charge (moving charge 1), there's no existing charge at P, so the work done is zero.

Wait, no, wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so when you bring the first moving charge to 2m from P, the only existing charge is the fixed one. So the work done is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

For the second moving charge, you bring it to 2m from P, and now there's one moving charge already at 2m. So the potential at the new charge's position is due to the fixed charge and the first moving charge.

Wait, but the moving charges are identical and are being brought to the same point, but if they are identical and repel, arranging them all at the same point isn't possible. So the problem must be assuming that they are placed at points where their mutual distances are 2m, but that's impossible for 12 charges. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at 2m from P and equally spaced, making their mutual potential energy zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero because the charges are constrained to a fixed distance, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the formula for the potential energy of a configuration of n identical charges placed on the surface of a sphere of radius r: U = (n * k * q^2) / (4πε0 r), but that's not a standard formula I recall. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy for n point charges on a sphere is (n^2 * k q^2) / (4 r), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy between all pairs of the 12 charges can be calculated as U = (12 * 11 / 2) * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m), assuming each pair is at a mutual distance of 2m. But that's only valid if all pairs are at 2m apart, which isn't possible for 12 charges on a sphere. So maybe the problem is making that assumption, leading to U = 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So, U1 = 12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)) = 12 * (2k e²/m) = 24k e²/m.

U2 = 66 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)) = 66 * (2k e²/m) = 132 k e²/m.

Total U = U1 + U2 = 156 k e²/m.

Let me compute that.

k e² = 8.98755e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.307e-28 J·m.

Now, 156 * 2.307e-28 / m.

Wait, no, because denominator is 2m, so each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4k e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So U = 156 * 2k e²/m.

Wait, but wait, 2e is the charge, so (2e)^2 is 4e².

So, 2e)^2 =4e².

So, each term is k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So, U = 156 * 2k e²/m = 312 k e²/m.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused with the factors. Let me compute it step by step.

Each mutual pair contributes k*(2e)^2/(2m) = k*4e²/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

Number of mutual pairs: 66.

So, U2 = 66 * 2k e²/m = 132 k e²/m.

U1 is the fixed charge and 12 moving charges: 12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)) = 12 * (2k e²/m) = 24 k e²/m.

Total U = U1 + U2 = (24 + 132) k e²/m = 156 k e²/m.

Now, compute 156 * (8.98755e9) * (e)^2 / (2 * 2).

Wait, no, wait: since each term is 2k e²/m, multiply by 156.

So, 156 * 2 = 312.

So, U = 312 * (k e²) / m.

k e² = 8.98755e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.307e-28 J·m.

So, U = 312 * (2.307e-28) / 2.

Wait, no, because the denominator is m, which is 2 meters.

Wait, no: because U = 312 * (k e²) / (2m) ?

Wait, no, each pair's U is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So, for 156 pairs (U1 is 12 pairs, U2 is 66 pairs, total 78 pairs?), wait no, no: U1 is 12 pairs (each of the 12 with P), U2 is 66 pairs (each pair of the 12). So, 12 + 66 = 78 pairs.

Each pair's U is 2k e²/m. So, U = 78 * 2k e²/m = 156 k e²/m.

Now, substitute the numbers:

k = 8.98755e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 meters.

So, U = 156 * 8.98755e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So,

U = 156 * 8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 / 2.

Compute numerator:

8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 156: 156 * 2.307e-28 = 3.598e-26.

Divide by 2: 3.598e-26 / 2 = 1.799e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is larger. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 1.57 times larger than 1.799e-26.

Hmm, this isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate:

Compute numerator: 8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 156: 2.307e-28 * 156 = 359.3e-28 = 3.593e-26.

Divide by 2: 3.593e-26 /2 = 1.7965e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that all mutual pairs are at 2m is incorrect, and the problem expects us to compute only U1 (the fixed charge and the 12), and that's why the closest option is B: 2.822e-26 J.

But earlier calculation of U1 was 2.7677e-27 J, which is about 0.277e-26 J, but option B is 2.822e-26, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each mutual pair contributes twice as much because of some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each moving charge contributes to the potential energy twice, once for each direction. But that shouldn't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9, which would change the result.

Let me try that.

k = 9e9.

So, U per pair (fixed and moving) is:

k*(2e)^2/(2m) =9e9 * (3.204e-19)^2/(4).

(3.204e-19)^2 = 10.264e-38.

So, 9e9 * 10.264e-38 = 9.2376e-28.

Divide by 4: 2.3094e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 2.7713e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair is counted twice, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express everything in terms of elementary charge and see if that helps.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Given the options, the only one close to my calculation for U1 is option B: 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times higher than my U1 calculation. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of e? Because sometimes e is 1.602e-19 C, but sometimes people might use e as 1.602e-19 J·s/(C·m) or something else. No, no, e is the elementary charge in coulombs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2. Let me compute it again.

(2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19 C)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 C².

3.204 squared is approximately 10.264.

So, 10.264e-38 C².

So that part is correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of n charges placed at the same point, which would be U = (n^2 * k * q^2)/(r), but that's incorrect because you can't have multiple charges at the same point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B, 2.822e-26 J, but my calculation is 2.7677e-27 J, which is about 1/10th of that. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, wait, let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 8.98755e9 * 10.2648e-38 = let's compute 8.98755e9 = 8.98755 * 1e9.

10.2648e-38 = 1.02648e-37.

So, 8.98755 * 1e9 * 1.02648e-37 = 8.98755 * 1.02648 * 1e-28.

Which is 9.225e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.225e-28 /4 = 2.306e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 2.306e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

So, 2.767e-27 J, which is 0.2767e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy not once but twice, but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the electric potential at point P due to the 12 charges, then multiplying by the charge at P to find the potential energy.

The electric potential V at P due to each of the 12 charges is k*(2e)/(2m), since each is at 2m. So, V = k*(2e)/(2m) = k e/m.

The total potential at P from all 12 charges is 12 * V = 12 * (k e/m).

The potential energy U is then the charge at P multiplied by this potential: U = (2e) * (12 k e/m).

So, U = 24 k e²/m.

Let me compute this:

k =8.98755e9 N·m²/C².

e =1.602e-19 C.

m =2 m.

So,

U =24 * 8.98755e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So,

24 *8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 /2.

24/2=12.

So,

12 *8.98755e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.98755e9 *2.566e-38 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by12: 2.307e-28 *12 =2.768e-27 J.

Which is same as before.

So, 2.768e-27 J, which is 0.2768e-26 J.

But option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed at a distance of 2 meters from each other, not from the fixed charge. But that wouldn't make sense because the fixed charge is at point P, so the 12 are at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a dipole or something else, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents. Let me recheck.

Wait, 8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.053e-28.

0.98755e9 *2.566e-38= approx 2.536e-28.

Total: 2.053e-28 +2.536e-28= 4.589e-28.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 8.98755e9 is 8.98755 *1e9.

So, 8.98755 *2.566 = approx 23.07.

So, 23.07e9 *1e-38 = 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Wait, that's correct.

So, 2.307e-28 *12=2.768e-27.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Given that none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all possible pairs, including the fixed charge. So, the fixed charge contributes to the potential energy with each of the 12, and each of the 12 contributes to the potential energy with each other. But without their exact positions, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and the mutual potential energy is zero. So the answer would be around 2.767e-27 J, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for e, such as e=1.6e-19 C.

Let me try that. e=1.6e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

U per pair:

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 /4 = (8.988 *10.24e-28) /4.

8.988 *10.24 ≈ 92.18.

So, 92.18e-28 /4 =23.045e-28 =2.3045e-27 J.

12 pairs: 2.765e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair contributes twice, once for each charge. But no, each pair is counted once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy in a different unit, but the options are in Joules, so that's correct.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Given that option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times higher than my calculation, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 10.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have multiplied by 2e for the fixed charge. Wait, no, the fixed charge is 2e, and each moving charge is also 2e. So, the potential energy between them is correctly calculated as k*(2e)^2/(2m).

Wait, but wait: perhaps the fixed charge is 2e, and each moving charge is 2e, so each pair contributes k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) =4k e²/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So, 12 pairs: 12 * 2k e²/m =24k e²/m.

Using k=8.988e9, e=1.6e-19.

So, 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 /2.

Wait, let's compute 1.6e-19 squared: 2.56e-38.

So,

24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38 /2.

Compute denominator: 2.

24/2=12.

So,

12 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by12: 2.768e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J, but based on my calculations, I'm getting approximately 2.767e-27 J, which is an order of magnitude lower. Perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check once more.

Wait, 8.98755e9 *10.2648e-38 =9.225e-28.

Divide by4:2.306e-28.

Multiply by12:2.767e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9, which would change the result.

Using k=9e9:

9e9 *10.2648e-38 =9.238e-28.

Divide by4:2.3095e-28.

Multiply by12:2.7714e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-18 C, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy in a different unit, but no, the options are in Joules.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the calculations, the closest option is B: 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of an isolated system consisting of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).

2. **Fixed Charge and 12 Moving Charges**:  
   The fixed charge at \( P \) interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 meters. Each pair contributes:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2m} = k \frac{4e^2}{2m} = \frac{2k e^2}{m}
   \]  
   There are 12 such pairs, so the total contribution is:  
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot \frac{2k e^2}{m} = \frac{24k e^2}{m}
   \]

3. **Mutual Potential Energy of the 12 Charges**:  
   The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not explicitly given. Assuming they are arranged on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters, the number of unique pairs among the 12 charges is \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \). If the mutual distance between any two charges is also assumed to be 2 meters, each pair contributes:  
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2m} = \frac{2k e^2}{m}
   \]  
   The total mutual potential energy is:  
   \[
   U_2 = 66 \cdot \frac{2k e^2}{m} = \frac{132k e^2}{m}
   \]

4. **Total Potential Energy**:  
   The total potential energy of the system is the sum of \( U_1 \) and \( U_2 \):  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_1 + U_2 = \frac{24k e^2}{m} + \frac{132k e^2}{m} = \frac{156k e^2}{m}
   \]

5. **Substitute Values**:  
   - \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)  
   - \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)  
   - \( m = 2 \, \text{m} \)  

   Compute \( k e^2 \):  
   \[
   k e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9)(1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.307 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J·m}
   \]  
   Total potential energy:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = \frac{156 \cdot 2.307 \times 10^{-28}}{2} = 1.799 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - Option A: \( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)  
   - Option B: \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)  
   - Option C: \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)  
   - Option D: \( 122.330 \, \text{J} \)  

   The calculated value \( 1.799 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) is closest to **Option B: \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, though slightly lower. This discrepancy may arise from rounding or assumptions about the mutual distances of the 12 charges.

### Conclusion:
The minimum energy of the system, based on the calculations and the given options, is best represented by **Option B**.  
Answer: B
