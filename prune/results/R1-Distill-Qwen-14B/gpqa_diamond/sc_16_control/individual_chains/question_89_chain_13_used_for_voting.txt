Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectra. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives product 1, a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I recall is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. The ¹H NMR of product 1 has some specific peaks: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Let me think about what reaction KOH would cause here.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So when treated with a strong base like KOH, it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction. Dehydrohalogenation, maybe. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons (1 and 3, which are probably adjacent in the adamantane structure), removing two HBr molecules would form a double bond. Wait, but the product is a ketone? Hmm, how does that happen?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe another reaction? Alternatively, considering that KOH can cause elimination, but maybe the structure of adamantane allows for ring expansion or contraction. Oh wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which are adjacent) react with strong bases, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone. So maybe the first product is an alkene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, KOH is a base. If there's an elimination, it forms a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the structure isn't just an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, I don't think so because the IR for an epoxide's carbonyl (if any) might be different, and the NMR doesn't show the typical epoxide protons. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps the reaction isn't straightforward elimination. Maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination, but that requires vicinal diols. No, wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so perhaps it's a dihalide undergoing a double elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a ketone if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Let me think about that. For example, in the case of vicinal dihalides where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons, elimination can form a double bond. But if the structure is such that upon elimination, the carbons lose the halides and form a carbonyl, maybe via a keto-enol tautomer or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an olefin and then undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. Let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet integrating for two hydrogens. Maybe that's an -OCH₂O- group, like in an epoxide? But wait, the IR doesn't show a peak around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹ which is typical for epoxide C-O-C stretching. Instead, the IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait, another approach. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH could lead to a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with four cyclohexane rings fused together. If elimination occurs, perhaps the structure forms a diketone or a single ketone. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkane with two double bonds? But that seems less likely because KOH is a base, not a radical initiator.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product. The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be an -OCH₂O- group, but in that case, the IR would have the epoxide peak. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a ketone. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group near an oxygen. Wait, but ketones don't have protons directly attached. Wait, in the case of a ketone, the adjacent groups would be CH₂. Hmm.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, the IR would show around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹, but in the given data, the IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an epoxide. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination forming a ketone. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps the structure rearranges to form a ketone. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, when two HBr molecules are eliminated, you get an alkene. But if the structure is such that the elimination leads to a carbonyl group, perhaps via a conjugated diene or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, I think I remember that when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a carbonyl through a conjugate elimination. For instance, in bicyclic systems, elimination can lead to a ketone if there's a bridgehead position.

Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So, if the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, eliminating two HBr molecules could form a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are usually not allowed (due to Bredt's rule). So that can't be. So, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. If two HBr molecules are lost, perhaps the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and an H, leading to a carbonyl formation. So, the two adjacent carbons each lose Br and H, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose H and Br, forming a double bond O, but that would require more than just elimination. Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination but with X groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amides.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but that seems a stretch.

Wait, another approach: the initial product's NMR. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group next to an electronegative atom. Let's say it's a carbonyl group. For example, if the structure is a diketone, but that might have more than two H in that region. Alternatively, it could be an ester group or an ether.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm peak is a singlet, which means the two H are equivalent and not split much. If it's an OCH₂O group, like in an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, a carbonyl adjacent to a CH₂. Let me think: perhaps a ketone where the ketone is flanked by a CH₂ group, but the NMR would show that as a triplet due to coupling with adjacent CH groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is 2H as a singlet. Singlet implies no neighboring H. So, if it's a CH₂ group next to an O, maybe like a carbonyl-O-CH₂-O- scenario, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but that would show up as different peaks.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether, but that doesn't align with the IR peak.

Wait, another angle: the 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH leads to the formation of a ketone. Let me think about the structure. So, if two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, upon elimination, maybe the two carbons form a carbonyl group each, but that would require more than elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination to form an alkene, and then another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple elimination but a substitution. But KOH is a base, so substitution is less likely unless it's an SN2, but with adamantane's structure, it's a rigid molecule, so SN2 is probably not feasible for vicinal dihalides.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH causes a ring-opening elimination, creating a ketone. For example, imagine that the bridgehead carbons each lose a Br and an H, leading to a ketone group in the center.

Wait, I'm not getting it yet. Let me try to think about the possible product. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH₂ group next to an oxygen, perhaps in a carbonyl group. Then, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so likely a ketone or ester.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like (CH₂)₂CO. But in that case, the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl would typically be a triplet, unless it's next to another CH₂. But in this case, the peak is a singlet, which suggests no neighboring H. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two H in 4.79 ppm are from a group where they have no neighboring H. For example, if it's a carbonyl group flanked by two CH₂ groups, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe via some kind of substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. Let's say, after elimination, two ketone groups are formed. But then the NMR would have a different pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring attached to a carbonyl. No, that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about the next step. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts reaction. But I'm not sure what the substrate would be here.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone (from IR and NMR), so perhaps product 2 is an acylated product. But if product 1 is 1,3-diketone, maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but I don't think so because the IR doesn't show the broad O-H stretch. Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a diol, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹, which is typical for O-H groups, so probably not a diol.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on the first reaction. Let me think about the possibility of dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form a diene or a more substituted alkene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a double bond (which is usually around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹). Wait, the IR here is at 1720, which is higher, so more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a cyclohexenone. So, heating with KOH could cause the formation of a ketone via an elimination reaction. For example, in some bicyclic systems, elimination can form a ketone. So, perhaps in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a bridgehead ketone.

Wait, bridgehead ketones are possible, but how? Let me imagine the structure: if each of the two bridgehead carbons has a Br, when KOH removes HBr from both, perhaps a carbonyl group forms between them. So, the two bridgehead carbons each lose Br and an H, and form a carbonyl group. That would leave a central carbonyl, and perhaps the rest of the structure becomes a ring with that carbonyl.

If product 1 is a bridgehead ketone, then the NMR would show certain features. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group next to the ketone. But if that's the case, why would it be a singlet? Because the CH₂ is adjacent to the carbonyl, but perhaps in a symmetric environment, so the two H are equivalent and not split by neighboring H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups, making it a singlet. Or maybe it's a bridge structure where the CH₂ is not adjacent to any H on either side.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is part of a ring where the neighboring groups are symmetric. For example, if the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone, but that would have more H in the NMR.

I'm not entirely confident about product 1, but perhaps I can proceed with what I have.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, which often catalyzes Friedel-Crafts reactions. So, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's undergoing acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ether with an adjacent carbonyl. For example, perhaps it's a lactone, which is an ester. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone that undergoes some kind of alkylation via Friedel-Crafts, but without an aromatic ring, I don't think that's feasible.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction isn't Friedel-Crafts. Another possibility is that aluminum isopropoxide is used as a catalyst for some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in forming an enol ether or an acetal.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone and it's treated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation. But without a carbonyl that can act as a nucleophile, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but as discussed earlier, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, maybe the second reaction is a Williamson-type ether synthesis, where an alkoxide attacks an alkyl halide. But product 1 doesn't seem to have an alkyl halide group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on product 1. Let me try to think of another approach.

The IR of product 1 shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with a ketone. The NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe this is a CH₂ group next to the ketone, and the rest of the structure is symmetric, making the CH₂ a singlet.

So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone where the carbonyl is flanked by two identical CH₂ groups. Or perhaps the CH₂ is part of a bridge structure where the neighboring groups don't have H, making it a singlet.

Moving on to product 2: it's formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetal. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex ring structure.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diketone. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could cause a rearrangement, such as a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol losing water to form a carbonyl. But product 1 isn't a diol.

Alternatively, the pinacol-like rearrangement of a 1,2-diketone? No, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via a retro-aldol reaction or some kind of dehydration, leading to a diene. Then, ozone would react with the diene.

Wait, product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would break the double bonds and form carbonyl groups. So, product 3 is the result of ozonolysis followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup, not oxidative, so it would form aldehydes and ketones instead of carboxylic acids or ketones).

So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. Specifically, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to piece this together.

If product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, which in turn is formed from product 1, which is from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (a ketone, maybe)
2. product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (possibly a diene)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (with carbonyl groups)

Now, thinking about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl group, perhaps in an aldehyde or ketone.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, which is usually a triplet due to coupling with adjacent CH₂ groups. Alternatively, it could be a CH group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the reductive workup (with dimethyl sulfide) would break the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as aldehydes or ketones.

Let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. For example, a 1,3-diene would break into two carbonyls, each with two adjacent CH₂ groups. Wait, but the exact structure would depend on where the double bonds are.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a triene, leading to multiple carbonyl groups in product 3.

Wait, but I'm not getting enough info about product 1 and 2. Maybe I should proceed with the information I have.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring H.

Let me think about possible structures. Suppose product 3 is an aldehyde. The aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because there are no neighboring H. But wait, if the aldehyde is part of a chain with adjacent CH₂ groups, the aldehyde H would couple with the adjacent CH₂. For example, RCHO, where R is CH₂CH₂..., the aldehyde H would couple with the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet if coupled with two H, but wait, in that case, the aldehyde H is at the end, so it might have a coupling with the next CH₂'s H.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is CH₂CH₂CO, then the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would have two H, each coupling with the neighboring CH₂.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So, if there's a CH₂ next to a carbonyl, the H's on that CH₂ would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But the question is about the coupling pattern. Let's say the CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two H on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H in the CH₂ group would see two neighboring H, so each would be a triplet. Alternatively, if each H couples with two H on one side and two H on the other, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but the question specifies the most deshielded H. So, perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For instance, in a structure like RCOCH₂CH₂X, the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would have H that are split by adjacent H. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that's adjacent to two other CH groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or another complex splitting.

Wait, another angle: when ozonolysis is performed on a diene, it breaks the double bonds and forms carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, each end would have a carbonyl group. If product 3 is, say, two aldehydes, then the aldehyde protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But aldehyde protons are typically singlets because they don't have neighboring H. But wait, if the aldehyde is part of a longer chain, the H could be coupled with adjacent H.

Wait, let's take a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two fragments, each with a carbonyl group. For example, if the diene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes (CHO) if the diene is at the ends. But that's a simple case.

Alternatively, if the diene is part of a ring, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But in adamantane derivatives, the structure is more complex.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic diene, and ozonolysis would form two ketone groups. Then, product 3 would have two ketone groups, each with adjacent CH groups. The H on those CH groups would be deshielded and show coupling.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded H. So, maybe it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like (CH₂)₂CO. Then, the CH₂ next to the CO would have H that are split by the adjacent CH₂.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

A triplet would mean each H is coupled with two H on one neighboring group. A triplet of triplets would be coupling with two groups, each with two H. A doublet of triplets would be coupling with two different sets, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to two different sets of H. For example, if the H is next to a CH₂ group and also next to another CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, maybe the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH₂ group. So, the H would couple with the two H from the CH₂, giving a triplet, and perhaps also couple with another H from an adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, the H could be part of a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, leading to a quartet (if each H is coupled with two H), but that's not one of the options.

Wait, in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl and also next to a CH₂ group. So, the H would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet. But if it's also coupled with another H from a neighboring group, perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is next to a CH₂ group and another CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another approach: when you ozonolyze a diene, you get carbonyl groups. If the diene is symmetric, the resulting product would have equivalent groups on both ends, so the H would be in a symmetrical environment. But if the diene is part of a ring, the product would have a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the diene is part of a six-membered ring, and ozonolysis would break it into two ketones. Then, each ketone would be adjacent to a CH₂ group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the coupling patterns. If a H is adjacent to a CH₂ group, each H would couple with the two H in the CH₂, leading to a triplet. If that H is also adjacent to another H (like from a CH group), it would split into a doublet, making a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the H is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each H in the first CH₂ would see two H in the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. But that's just a CH₂ next to another CH₂, so each H would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group next to a CH₂, then each H in the CH would couple with the two H in the CH₂, leading to a triplet. If there's another adjacent H, say from a CH group on the other side, then perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, maybe it's a situation where the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH₂ and also to another CH group. So, the H would be split by both sets. For example, if there are two neighboring H on one side and two on the other, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH group. So, each H in the CH₂ would couple with the single H in the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but the options don't include a doublet; they have a triplet, etc.

Wait, maybe the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH₂ group, and the CH₂ is adjacent to another CH group. So, the H would couple with two H from the CH₂ and perhaps one H from the other CH, leading to a triplet of doublets, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group that is next to two different CH₂ groups, leading to coupling with four H, resulting in a pentet. But that's option D.

Wait, but that would require the H to be adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two H. So, the splitting would be multiplet with (2+2+1)=5 lines, but that's a pentet.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a CH group next to a CH₂ group, which is itself next to another CH group. So, the H would couple with two H from the adjacent CH₂ and one H from the next CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, that could be. So, each H would be a triplet due to the CH₂, and then each of those would be further split by another H, making a triplet of triplets.

So, in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two H from one group and two H from another, that would be a triplet of triplets. Or if it's coupled with three H, that would be a quartet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two H from one group and one H from another, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option either.

Wait, going back, perhaps the most deshielded H is a methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, the CH₂ would be next to another CH₂ group, leading each H to be a triplet. But that's a simple triplet, which is option A.

But why would it be the most deshielded? Because it's next to the carbonyl, the CH₂ would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, deshielded implies downfield, so higher ppm. So, perhaps the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is an aldehyde proton, which is typically around 9-10 ppm and a singlet. But the options don't include a singlet.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde proton is split. For example, if the aldehyde is part of a CH₂CHO group, then the aldehyde H would be a triplet due to coupling with the two H from the adjacent CH₂. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But I'm not sure about the structure leading to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH₂ group. So, the H would couple with the two H from the CH₂, making a triplet, and perhaps also couple with another H from the carbonyl-adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when ozonolysis is performed on a diene, the product is typically two carbonyl groups. If the diene was part of a ring, the ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain with carbonyls at both ends.

Suppose product 2 is a bicyclic diene, and ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups. If the product 3 is a diketone, then the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and show a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, but in a diketone, the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be part of a CH group. For example, (CH3)2CO would have the CH3 as a singlet, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, if product 3 is a diketone with a structure like CH₂(CO)CH₂CO, then the CH₂ groups next to the carbonyls would have H that are deshielded. Each H in those CH₂ groups would be adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps coupled with each other.

Wait, but in that case, each H in the CH₂ would be adjacent to two H on the same CH₂ and possibly another H from the neighboring group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too vague.

Another possibility: perhaps product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH₂ group. So, the H would couple with the two H from the CH₂, giving a triplet, and perhaps also with another H from the adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two H from one group and two H from another, that would create a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, the initial product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H, singlet). Maybe that's an OCH₂O group in an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, product 3 after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. The options are triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), pentet (D).

If the H is adjacent to a CH₂ group (two H), it would be a triplet. If it's also adjacent to another CH group (one H), it would split into a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if it's adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two H, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the H is part of a CH group that's between two CH₂ groups. So, each H would see two H from each CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, that would be option B: triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group next to a CH₂, which is next to another CH group. So, the H would couple with two H from the adjacent CH₂ and one H from the next CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

In that case, the answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (product 1) is formed, which exhibits a strong IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen. This aligns with the formation of a ketone, where the CH₂ group is flanked by symmetric environments, making it a singlet.

When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, product 2 is formed. Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, likely facilitates a rearrangement or elimination reaction. Given the carbonyl group in product 1, product 2 could involve the formation of a diene or a related structure.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break the double bonds, resulting in aldehydes or ketones in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby hydrogens.

The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen depends on its neighboring groups. If the hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH₂ group and another CH group, it would couple with the two hydrogens from the CH₂ group, forming a triplet. Additionally, coupling with the single hydrogen from the adjacent CH group would further split the signal, resulting in a triplet of triplets. This matches the description of the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.
