Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down step by step. So, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation and how temperature affects the population of energy levels.

Alright, the star's parameters are given when it's not covered by spots: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh right, the spots are cooler, so the average temperature of the entire star goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels: level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots (lower temperature), the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't (higher temperature). We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2. Under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio should follow the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations is proportional to the ratio of their statistical weights multiplied by an exponential term involving the energy difference and temperature.

Let me write it down. The ratio of N2 to N1 is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, if E2 > E1, then higher temperature would make the exponential term larger, meaning more population in the higher energy level. So when the temperature goes down, the exponential term becomes smaller, so N2/N1 decreases. Since the observed ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present, that makes sense because N2 would be lower relative to N1 when T is lower.

Wait, the observed ratio is N1/N2. So when the star has spots (lower Teff), N1/N2 increases. But the question says the ratio decreases. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me think again. Oh, the question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So N1/N2 is lower when spots are present. So when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because according to the Boltzmann equation, let's think: when T decreases, the exponential term is smaller, so N2/N1 is smaller. So N1/N2 would be higher when T is lower. But the question says when the star has spots, the ratio (N1/N2) decreases. That seems contradictory. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check. The ratio is N1/N2. Without spots, the Teff is 6000 K. With spots, Teff is 5500 K. So when the star is cooler, the ratio N1/N2 is observed to be lower. But according to Boltzmann, when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 should be higher because N2 is less populated relative to N1. So the observed decrease in the ratio when the star has spots suggests that in reality, the situation might be different. Maybe I got the ratio backwards in the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the Boltzmann equation setup. Let me write the correct formula. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming E2 > E1, so the exponent is negative. So as T increases, exp term increases, so N2/N1 increases. So when T is higher (no spots), N2 is more populated relative to N1. So N1/N2 would be lower when T is higher. Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Suppose when there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When there are spots, Teff is 5500 K. Without spots, N1/N2 = N1/N2_6000. With spots, N1/N2 = N1/N2_5500.

If the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots, that means N1/N2_5500 < N1/N2_6000. Wait, but according to the equation, when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, so N1/N2 increases. That's opposite to what the problem states. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards.

Wait, maybe in the problem, the ratio is N2/N1, not N1/N2. Let me check the question again. The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" â€” so does that mean N1/N2 or N2/N1? Hmm, the wording isn't entirely clear, but usually, the ratio is presented as the higher level over the lower. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the ratio N2/N1. So when the star has spots (lower T), N2/N1 decreases. That would make sense because when the temperature is lower, the higher energy level (2) is less populated. So if the ratio N2/N1 is observed to decrease when the star has spots, then the factor by which it changes is (N2/N1)_6000 divided by (N2/N1)_5500.

But the problem states that the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So let me think again. Let me clarify the ratio.

If the ratio is N1/N2, then when T is lower (with spots), N1/N2 would be higher. Because N2 is lower. So the observed ratio would be higher, not lower. But the problem says it's lower. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the ratio is N2/N1. Because if N2/N1 is lower when T is lower, then the observed ratio is lower. So perhaps the question meant the ratio N2/N1, but the wording says N1/N2. Or maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, the question states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So that ratio is (N1/N2)_hot divided by (N1/N2)_cool, but no, they're comparing the same star before and after. Wait, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So (N1/N2)_spots < (N1/N2)_no_spots. So the ratio N1/N2 is lower when T is lower. But according to Boltzmann, N1/N2 is inversely proportional to the exponential term. Let me recast the equation.

From the Boltzmann equation:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp[ -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ]

So N1/N2 = [ (g1/g2) ] * exp[ (E2 - E1)/(k T) ]

Wait, that's correct. So N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by g1/g2.

So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases because T is in the denominator. So the exponential term gets bigger, meaning N1/N2 increases as T decreases.

So if the observed ratio N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots, that would imply that N1/N2 is lower when T is lower. But according to the equation, that's not the case. So this suggests that perhaps the ratio being referred to is N2/N1. Because in that case, when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, which matches the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, but the way the question is worded, it's N1/N2. So maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not referring to the ratio as the usual N2/N1 but the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio in the wrong order. Let me think: If the observed ratio (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots, that would imply that (N1/N2)_spots < (N1/N2)_no_spots.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), N1/N2 increases because the exponential term (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive and increases as T decreases.

So this would mean that (N1/N2)_5500 > (N1/N2)_6000, which would mean the ratio increases when the star has spots. But the problem says the ratio decreases when it has spots. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Wait, maybe in the problem, the effective temperature that matters is not the overall Teff of the star, but the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti lines form. Because starspots are cooler regions, perhaps the radiation field is different in spots. But the question says the photosphere is in LTE, so probably the effective temperature is the same as the photospheric temperature for the purpose of the Boltzmann factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the ratio of the populations. Let's proceed with the assumption that the ratio being referred to is N2/N1, which does decrease when T decreases. Because the problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. Maybe the problem statement actually refers to N2/N1 as the ratio, but the wording is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which is N2/N1.

Wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. So N1/N2. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases, which would mean the ratio becomes larger. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1. Because when T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease, which would match the problem statement. Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So perhaps there was a mix-up in the wording. Let's proceed with that assumption, that the ratio is N2/N1.

So, problem statement:

When the star is spotless, Teff is 6000 K.

When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

The ratio of N2/N1 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So (N2/N1)_5500 < (N2/N1)_6000.

We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes, i.e., (N2/N1)_6000 / (N2/N1)_5500.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) * (g2/g1).

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same (perhaps for simplicity, or maybe the problem expects us to ignore them since they're the same for the ratio?), but the problem statement doesn't specify. Hmm, but wait, the problem gives a specific wavelength for the transitionâ€”1448 Ã…. That's in the near UV or far UV. So, the energy difference E2-E1 corresponds to the photon energy of that wavelength.

So, E2 - E1 = hc / Î».

Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and Î» is 1448 Ã… = 1448e-10 m.

Let me compute E2 - E1.

h = 6.626e-34 JÂ·s

c = 3e8 m/s

Î» = 1448e-10 m.

So E = hc/Î» = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 JÂ·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, but that's in joules. To convert to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV â‰ˆ 8.57 eV.

So E2-E1 â‰ˆ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, but Ti has transitions in the UV, so maybe that's correct.

Now, putting this into the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T )

Compute this for T = 6000 K and T = 5500 K.

For T = 6000 K:

(8.57) / (8.617e-5 * 6000) = 8.57 / (0.517) â‰ˆ 16.58.

So the exponent is -16.58.

exp(-16.58) is a very small number. Let me compute that. exp(16) is about 8.89e6, so exp(-16) is ~1.127e-7. exp(-16.58) is exp(-16) * exp(-0.58) â‰ˆ 1.127e-7 * 0.56 â‰ˆ 6.3e-8.

Similarly, for T=5500 K:

(8.57)/(8.617e-5 *5500) = 8.57 / (0.4739) â‰ˆ 18.09.

Exponent is -18.09.

exp(-18.09) is even smaller. exp(-18) is ~1.5e-8, so exp(-18.09) is about 1.3e-8.

So now, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) * (g2/g1).

Assuming that g2 and g1 are the same (maybe they're neglected or considered equal, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can ignore them for this calculation), the ratio N2/N1 at 6000 K is proportional to ~6.3e-8, and at 5500 K, it's ~1.3e-8.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (6.3e-8) / (1.3e-8) â‰ˆ 4.846.

So the factor is approximately 4.85. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, and option D is ~2.9. So 4.85 is closest to option C (~4.5).

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (N2/N1)_6000 / (N2/N1)_5500 = (6.3e-8) / (1.3e-8) â‰ˆ 4.85.

So the factor is approximately 4.85, which is about 4.5 when rounded. So the answer is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was N2/N1. Let me make sure. Because the problem statement says the observed ratio (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. But according to the calculation, if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, which matches the problem's observation.

Wait, no. Wait, if N2/N1 decreases when T decreases, then when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N2/N1 is lower. So the observed ratio (N2/N1) decreases when spots are present. So the factor by which this ratio changes is (N2/N1)_6000 divided by (N2/N1)_5500, which is approximately 4.85. So the factor is about 4.85, which is approximately 4.5, so option C is correct.

Alternatively, if the ratio being referred to is N1/N2, which would have the opposite behavior, but the problem states that this ratio decreases when there are spots, which would not fit with the calculation. So I think the correct assumption is that the ratio being discussed is N2/N1, leading to an increase in the factor of about 4.85.

So the closest option is C) ~4.5.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the assumption of Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of levels 2 and 1, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Ã…, which allows us to calculate the energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\) using the relation:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Ã…} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting the values:

\[
h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{JÂ·s}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s},
\]

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E_2 - E_1 \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, we calculate the Boltzmann factor \(\exp(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT})\) for the two temperatures: \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots). The Boltzmann constant is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). For \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)} \approx 16.58,
\]

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right) = \exp(-16.58) \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

For \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)} \approx 18.09,
\]

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right) = \exp(-18.09) \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

The ratio \(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\) is proportional to \(\exp(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT})\), so the factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{6.3 \times 10^{-8}}{1.3 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 4.85.
\]

This factor is approximately 4.5 when rounded to one decimal place. The problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, which aligns with the calculation since \(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\) decreases as \(T\) decreases.

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is closest to **4.5**.
