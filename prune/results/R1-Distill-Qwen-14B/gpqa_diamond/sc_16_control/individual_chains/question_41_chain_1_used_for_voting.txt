Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. Okay, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to a lab observer. Interesting.

Let me read the problem again. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. 

Wait, okay. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. The observer is in the lab, so their frame is where the glass is moving. I think this involves some relativity concepts because velocities are involved, especially when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But wait, the index of refraction is n, so the speed of light in the glass without any motion would be v_light = c/n, right? So normally, when the glass is stationary, the light's speed is 1/n.

But now the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light? Hmm. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. There's that velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in different frames is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, that's when you're transforming from one frame to another moving at velocity v relative to the first.

Wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving through the glass. So the light's speed in the glass's rest frame is v_light = c/n, which is 1/n since c=1. So from the lab's perspective, how do we calculate the speed?

Wait, no, wait a second. Let's think about this. The glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the light. Oh, wait, no, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So if the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer, that means the beam is moving towards the observer as well?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. Let's imagine the setup. The lab observer sees the glass moving towards them. The light beam is going through the glass and is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving towards the observer because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Hmm. So maybe the light is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction, so perhaps the light's speed relative to the lab is affected by both the glass's motion and the refractive index.

Wait, but the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So perhaps I should first find the speed of light in the glass's frame, then apply the velocity addition formula to find it in the lab's frame.

In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n = 1/n. So from the glass's perspective, the light is moving at 1/n towards it (since the glass is moving towards the observer, the light is moving towards the observer as well, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion in the lab frame).

Wait, no. The light is moving through the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n, but in which direction? Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer (same direction as the glass). In the glass's own frame, the light's speed is 1/n towards the observer. So when we transform from the glass frame to the lab frame (which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass), we can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the lab frame sees the glass moving at velocity v. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at (1/n) in the same direction. So the light's velocity in the lab frame u is given by the velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²), but since c=1, that's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

Wait, but wait: in the glass's frame (u'), the light is moving at speed u' = 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab frame is moving at v relative to the glass, right? Or wait, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So the lab is moving at -v relative to the glass.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the glass's frame is moving at v relative to the lab. So to find the lab's measurement of the light's speed, we can use the Lorentz velocity transformation.

In the glass frame (S'), the light's speed is u' = 1/n. We need to find u in the lab frame (S), which is moving at velocity v relative to S'. So the formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v) / c²]. Since c=1, it's u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

So substituting u' = 1/n, we get u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v) = [ (v + 1/n) ] / [ 1 + v/n ].

Wait, let me compute that. Let's write it as ( (v + (1/n)) ) / (1 + v/n ). Let's factor out 1/n in the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: v + (1/n) = (n v + 1)/n.

Denominator: 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n.

So u = [ (n v +1)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ].

The n denominators cancel out, so u = (n v +1 )/(n + v).

Hmm, that's (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me look at the options.

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that would be the answer. But wait, what if the direction is considered? Because the velocity u is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the formula would apply as is.

Wait, but let's think about units. The speed has to be less than c=1, right? Because even when the glass is moving, the light can't exceed c in the lab frame.

Wait, let's test some edge cases. Suppose v is zero. Then u = (1 + 0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which is correct. Because if the glass isn't moving, the light's speed is 1/n.

Another case: Suppose n=1, which is vacuum, so the speed of light in vacuum is 1. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. Then, applying the formula, u = (1 + v)/(1 +v) =1. Which is correct because in vacuum, light's speed can't change.

Wait, but in this scenario, if the glass is vacuum, then the light would just be moving at speed 1 regardless of the glass's velocity. So the formula gives 1, which matches option B, but also option A gives the same when n=1. Hmmm.

Wait, because when n=1, option A becomes (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1. So both A and B would give 1. But option B is 1, which is correct regardless of velocity. So perhaps when v is not zero, the correct formula is A, but when it's n=1, you get 1 either way.

Wait, but let me think about another case. Suppose n=2, v=0. Then the speed is (1+0)/(2+0)=1/2, which is correct for n=2.

Another case: n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(1+2*0.5)/(2+0.5)= (1+1)/(2.5)= 2/2.5=0.8. So 0.8, which is less than 1, which makes sense.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. So the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well.

So the velocity transformation would be as I did earlier, leading to option A.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the laboratory observer, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and its velocity relative to the lab is \( v \). The light beam propagates through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, toward the observer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass (Rest Frame):**  
   In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), since the speed of light in a medium is \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), and \( c = 1 \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition:**  
   The lab frame observes the glass moving at velocity \( v \). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
   \]  
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \):  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification:**  
   Factor out \( \frac{1}{n} \) in the numerator and denominator:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
   \]  
   The \( n \) terms cancel out, leaving:  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Edge Cases:**  
   - If \( v = 0 \), the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.  
   - If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light is always \( 1 \), consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in a vacuum.  
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \), the formula gives \( u = \frac{1 + 2(0.5)}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is less than \( 1 \), as expected.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the lab observer is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which matches **Option A**.
