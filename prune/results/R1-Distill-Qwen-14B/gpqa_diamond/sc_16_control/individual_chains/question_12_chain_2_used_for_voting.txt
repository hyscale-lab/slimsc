Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino's mass? Oh right, neutrinos are considered massless in these kinds of problems, so its rest mass is zero.

So, the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the mu and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction so that their vector sum is zero. That makes sense because momentum is conserved.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the mu and the neutrino.

The mu has rest mass, so its energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest energy. The neutrino, being massless, has energy equal to its momentum times c squared, but since we're working in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), the neutrino's energy is just |p|, the magnitude of its momentum.

Let me denote the momentum of the mu as p. Then the neutrino's momentum must be -p to conserve momentum, so their magnitudes are the same. So the neutrino's energy is p (since E=pc for massless particles).

The mu's energy is sqrt(p²c^4 + m_mu²c^4) / c^2, but again in these units, it's sqrt(p² + m_mu²). Wait, actually, in natural units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). So the mu's energy is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2), and the neutrino's energy is p.

So the total energy after decay is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p. This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So the equation is:

p + sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let me rearrange this equation. Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right-hand side:

(139.6 - p)^2 = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p + p²

So the equation becomes:

p² + (105.7)^2 = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p²

I can cancel p² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p

Now, rearrange to solve for p:

2*139.6 p = 139.6² - (105.7)^2

Let me calculate the right-hand side first. Compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6 squared: Let's see, 140 squared is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7 squared: 105^2 is 11025, and 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross terms are 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7² = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So,

139.6² - 105.7² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

So,

2 * 139.6 * p = 8315.67

Calculate 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So,

p = 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that:

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ Let's see.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 is 8376-279.2=8096.8. That's less than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps 29.7? Let's compute 279.2 *29.7.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8

279.2 *0.7= 195.44

So 29.7 is 29 + 0.7, so sum is 8096.8 + 195.44 = 8292.24.

Hmm, 8292.24 is close to 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8292.24 ≈23.43.

So, 279.2 * x =23.43 → x≈23.43/279.2 ≈0.08397.

So p is approximately 29.7 + 0.08397 ≈29.78397 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me see:

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87

So, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, that's about 29.78 MeV/c.

But let me double-check the exact division.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.783 equals approximately 279.2 * 29.783.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 ÷279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is more than 8315.67. So it's 30 - (8376-8315.67)/279.2.

The difference is 8376 -8315.67 =60.33.

So, 60.33 /279.2 ≈0.216.

So, p ≈30 -0.216 ≈29.784 MeV/c.

So, p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the mu's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²). Let me compute that.

m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so m_mu squared is 11172.49 (as computed earlier).

p squared is (29.78)^2 ≈ 887.0 (since 30²=900, so 29.78²≈ 887).

So, p² + m_mu² ≈887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

sqrt(12059.49)= approximately 109.8 MeV.

Wait, wait, 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is close to 12059.49. So approximately 109.8 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

Now, the total energy after is 109.8 +29.78 ≈139.58 MeV, which is close to 139.6, so the calculation seems correct.

But wait, the question is about the kinetic energy of the products. The kinetic energy (KE) is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

For the mu: KE_mu = (E_mu) - m_mu.

E_mu is 109.8 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu =109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is its total energy, since it has no rest mass. So KE_nu =29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, my approximate calculation gives 4.1 and 29.78, which is very close to option D.

Let me think again: perhaps I should do the calculation more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute p more precisely.

So, 8315.67 ÷279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.78.

Wait, 279.2 *29 =8096.8.

279.2 *0.7=195.44

279.2 *0.08=22.336

So 29.78 is 29 +0.7 +0.08.

So 279.2*29.78=8096.8 +195.44 +22.336= 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24; +22.336=8314.576.

Which is almost exactly 8315.67.

So the difference is 8315.67-8314.576=1.094.

So, 279.2 * x =1.094 → x=1.094/279.2 ≈0.00392.

So, p=29.78 +0.00392 ≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So, p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, calculating E_mu: sqrt(29.784^2 +105.7^2).

29.784^2: let's compute 29.78^2.

29.78 *29.78: let's compute it as (30 -0.22)^2 =30² -2*30*0.22 +0.22²=900-13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

So p^2=886.8484 MeV².

m_mu squared:11172.49 MeV².

So E_mu squared is 886.8484 +11172.49 =12059.3384 MeV².

E_mu = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈109.81 MeV.

So, KE_mu =E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is p=29.784 MeV.

Wait, the options have in option D) 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close to what I have.

So option D is the correct one.

Wait, but let me double-check the equations because I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another approach. Let me think about the invariant mass.

Wait, another approach: the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. After decay, the mu and neutrino's momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the mu's momentum as p, so the neutrino's is -p, so |p| is same.

The total energy is sum of E_mu and E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4)/c^2 → in natural units, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

E_nu = |p|, since it's massless.

So, sum of energies is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

We have to solve for p.

Which is the same equation as before.

Hmm, but perhaps I can express KE in terms of the available energy.

Wait, another approach: the pion's rest mass is M = m_mu + m_nu + Q, but since m_nu is zero, and Q is the total kinetic energy.

Wait, no, the pion is initially at rest, so its energy is M_pi c^2. After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the mu and neutrino.

So, M_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = m_mu c^2 + KE_mu,

E_nu = p c = |p| c.

But in natural units, E_nu = |p|.

So,

M_pi = m_mu + KE_mu + |p|.

But |p| = E_nu.

And from momentum conservation, |p| is same for both.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the kinetic energy of the mu is given by (M_pi^2 - (m_mu + m_nu)^2 )/(2 M_pi).

Wait, but m_nu is zero.

So, KE_mu = (M_pi^2 - m_mu^2 )/(2 M_pi )

Wait, is that a correct formula? Let me think.

Wait, in a decay where a particle at rest decays into two particles, the kinetic energy of each can be found using the formula.

For two-body decay, the kinetic energy of each particle is given by:

KE = [ (M^2 - m1^2 - m2^2 )^2 ]^(1/2) / (2 M (M + m1 + m2)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm thinking of a different formula. Alternatively, in the rest frame, the kinetic energy can be found via:

KE = (M^2 - (m1 + m2)^2 )/(2 M )

But wait, no, that can't be. Because if the particles are moving, their energies are higher.

Wait, another approach: the total energy after decay is M_pi. The rest energy of the mu is m_mu, and the neutrino's rest energy is zero.

So, the sum of their energies is M_pi.

But the mu's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p.

So,

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = M_pi.

Which is the same equation as before.

So, solving for p.

Wait, perhaps simplifying the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = M_pi - p.

Squaring both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = M_pi^2 - 2 M_pi p + p^2.

Cancel p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = M_pi^2 - 2 M_pi p.

So,

2 M_pi p = M_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

So,

p = [ M_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ] / (2 M_pi )

Ah, that's a much simpler formula.

So,

p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 *139.6 )

So compute numerator first:

139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 =140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2=19600 - 112 +0.16=19488.16.

105.7^2=11172.49.

Subtract: 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

So,

p = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6 ) =8315.67/(279.2 ) ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Which is the same as before.

Then, KE_mu is the kinetic energy of the muon, which is E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2 ) ≈sqrt( 887.0 +11172.49 )= sqrt(12059.49 ) ≈109.81 MeV.

So, KE_mu=109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So, that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, **π⁺**, into a muon, **μ⁺**, and a neutrino, **ν**. The rest masses are given as:

- Rest mass of **π⁺**: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Rest mass of **μ⁺**: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Rest mass of **ν**: \( m_{\nu} = 0 \, \text{MeV} \) (massless).

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]
   In natural units (\( c = 1 \)), \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = |p| \), where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum shared between the muon and neutrino.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \)
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Calculating Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:
   The muon's total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:
   The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option B**: \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Correct.
