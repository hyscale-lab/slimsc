Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.

So, there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, okay, the key here is probably the Boltzmann equation because it relates the population of energy levels in thermal equilibrium. The Boltzmann factor, right? The probability of a particle being in an excited state is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy levels have a difference ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. For star_1, the excitation level is twice that of star_2. So, the ratio of the populations (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, I think the ratio n1_upper/n1_lower is twice the ratio n2_upper/n2_lower. So, (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2*(n2_upper/n2_lower).

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars because it's the same transition, the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If the two energy levels have the same g values for both stars, then the ratio simplifies to just exp(-ΔE/(kT)) for each star. So, for star_1, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, according to the problem, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). Which translates to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, let me write that equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Hmm, I can rearrange this to find a relation between T1 and T2. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

ln [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] = ln [ 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Simplify the left side: -ΔE/(k T1)

Right side: ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

So, putting them together:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Hmm, let's rearrange terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Let's write this as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So, equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, the question asks for the equation that relates T1 and T2. Looking at the options, none of them have ΔE or k. So, probably, the equation must have the ratio involving ln(2) on one side and the temperatures on the other. So, perhaps I can solve for (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but according to our equation, ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Ah, but wait, we know the value of ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute what ΔE/(k) is. Oh wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, around 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait a minute! Because ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, ΔE/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, substituting that into our equation, we get:

1 * ( (T1-T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, that's option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So, option D is the correct equation.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of energy levels in thermal equilibrium. For two stars, star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the populations of energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1, the excitation level is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.
