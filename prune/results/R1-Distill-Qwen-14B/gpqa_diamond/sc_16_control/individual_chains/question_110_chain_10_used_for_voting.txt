Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—actually, the question says it can observe stars that are brighter than 17 mag. So V magnitude less than or equal to 17? Because, wait, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. Oh wait, no, I think I got that backwards. Oh right, the lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter the star. So if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17, that means apparent magnitude less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitude <=17 can be observed.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent magnitude <=16.

So the goal is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes <=17 (for ESPRESSO) AND <=16 (for HIRES). Because both can detect them.

Wait, but wait—no. Because both instruments can observe the same star only if the star's apparent magnitude is bright enough for both. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can see it, and since 16 is less than 17, ESPRESSO can also see it. So the star must have V ≤16 to be observable by both.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me clarify. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, which means up to 17. So any star with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars up to V ≤16. So a star that's V ≤16 can be observed by both. But a star that's V=16.5 can't be observed by HIRES, but can be by ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have V ≤16.

Wait, but the question says "can be detected with both". So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16 to be picked by HIRES. Because if a star is brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it? Wait no, if the apparent V is 16.5, that's fainter than 16. So HIRES can't observe it because it's too faint. So to be detected by both, the star must have apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16.

So I need to calculate the apparent V mag for each star. Let's see each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.
Apparent mag (m) = M - 5 +5 log10(d) ? Wait, no. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So M is 15.5, d=10.

So m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 5*0 =15.5. So m=15.5. Both instruments can see it? Because 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can. And less than 17, so ESPRESSO can. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=16.5. That's above both ESPRESSO's 17 and HIRES's 16. So ESPRESSO can see it (16.5<17?), wait, no—wait, wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So if a star's V is 17 or brighter (lower number), can it be observed? Wait, I think I might have misread it.

Wait the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's V is 17 or less (brighter, including 17), they can observe it. So for ESPRESSO, m <=17.

Wait, but Star2's m is 16.5. So 16.5 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES requires m <=16. So Star2's m is 16.5 >16. So HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: m is given as 15.5. But wait, the note says E(B-V)=0.6, and the total absorption in V is 3.1*(B-V). Oh wait, I think I need to compute the extinction (extinction causes stars to appear dimmer, so m_intrinsic = m_observed + extinction).

Wait, the E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed B-V and the intrinsic B-V. The total absorption in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, what is the real m?

Wait, no. Wait, the star's actual apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. So the given m is already corrected? Or not?

Wait, the problem says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So the total absorption A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.6 = 1.86. So the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V. So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64. Wait, no, wait. Because extinction makes stars appear fainter. So when you observe a star with extinction, its apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, no, the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if the star's m_observed is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64. So the actual apparent magnitude is 13.64, which is brighter. So the star is actually brighter than what's observed, but for the purpose of detection, it's the observed m that matters. Because the observatories detect the observed magnitude.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about whether the instrument can detect the star. So the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, it's dimmed. So without extinction, it would be brighter, but with extinction, it's 15.5. So the instrument detects the star as m=15.5. So for the instrument, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So for Star3, m=15.5. That's less than 16, so HIRES can see it. And less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Star4: Star4 has M=15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So m (apparent) is M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(1) =20.5? Wait, wait, no, because d=10, so log(10/10)=0. So m =15.5. But then, extinction: A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed m would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V? No, wait, the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Because when there's extinction, the star appears dimmer, so m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. But wait, the intrinsic apparent magnitude is calculated without extinction. So in reality, the star's observed m is m_intrinsic + A_V. So wait, in Star4's case, what's the apparent magnitude?

Wait, the star's absolute magnitude is given as 15.5. The distance is 10 pc, so m would be 15.5 (because M +5 log (d/10) =15.5 + 0 =15.5). But with extinction, the observed m is 15.5 + A_V. So A_V is 1.24, so m_observed=16.74.

But wait, the problem says "apparent V magnitude of 16.5" for Star2, but for Star4, the given information is a bit different. Let me check the question again.

Wait, Star4: "absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us." So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m = M +5 log10(10/10) =15.5. Then, the observed m = m_intrinsic + A_V? Or is the given m already accounting for extinction? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question for Star3 says that the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So the apparent magnitude given is after extinction, or before? Because that affects how we compute. Hmm, I think the question states that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, so perhaps the apparent magnitude is after extinction. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the star's brightness is affected by extinction. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the given apparent magnitude is the observed (i.e., with extinction). So in that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is already considering the extinction. So for Star4, perhaps the given absolute magnitude is the intrinsic, and then we have to compute the apparent magnitude, including extinction.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is: for Star4, calculate the apparent magnitude (without considering extinction) and then add the extinction to get the observed m.

So for Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m = 15.5 + 5 log10(10/10) =15.5 + 0=15.5. Then, the extinction A_V=3.1 * E(B-V)=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed m is m =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent V magnitude is 16.74. Now, can both instruments detect it? ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so 16.74 is less than 17, so yes. HIRES can detect up to 16. So 16.74 is greater than 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 can't be observed by both.

Wait, no—wait, the given Star3's m is 15.5, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So does that mean the m is 15.5, which is the observed (after extinction) or is it the intrinsic (without extinction)? If it's the observed, then we don't need to adjust. But I think the way the problem is structured, the apparent magnitude given is the observed (i.e., after extinction). So for Star3, m=15.5, and since it's less than 16, both can detect it.

Wait, but for Star4, the absolute magnitude is 15.5, d=10, so m=15.5 (intrinsic). Then with extinction, observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So Star4's m is16.74, which is above HIRES's 16 limit, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: Absolute V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 * (-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approximately 15.0.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 5/10 is 0.5. log10(0.5) is approximately -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So about 15.0.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0. So for HIRES, which can detect up to 16, 15.0 is acceptable. For ESPRESSO, which can detect up to 17, that's also acceptable. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Now let's go back to Star3. Its given m is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, but considering extinction, the intrinsic m would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me clarify.

The apparent magnitude (m) is a measure of how bright the star appears. Extinction (due to dust in the interstellar medium) makes stars appear dimmer, so their observed m is higher than their intrinsic m. So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

In the case of Star3, the given m is 15.5, but that's probably the observed (with extinction) m. So to get the intrinsic m, we subtract A_V. But that's not necessary for this problem because the question is about the observed m. Because the instruments detect the observed m. So for the purpose of whether they can be detected, it's the observed m that matters.

So for Star3, m=15.5, which is less than 16, so both can detect it.

Wait, but what about Star3's distance? The question says it's located at 15 pc. So I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me correct that.

Star3: M=15.5, d=15 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5 log10(15/10) =15.5 +5 log10(1.5).

Log10(1.5) is approximately 0.1761.

So 5 * 0.1761 =0.8805.

So m=15.5 +0.8805=16.3805.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction is 16.38.

Then, the extinction A_V is 3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So observed m =16.38 +1.86=18.24.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the observed m is 18.24, then it's brighter than 17 (for ESPRESSO can't see it)? Wait no, wait: if m is 18.24, that's fainter than 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with m <=17, so 18.24 is beyond that. So it can't be observed by ESPRESSO. HIRES requires m <=16, so 18.24 is way beyond.

Wait, so this suggests Star3's observed m is 18.24, which is not detectable by either. But that can't be right, because Star3's given data is different. Oh wait, perhaps I misunderstood Star3's given data. Let me reread the question.

Star3: RA = 11h, DEC=48deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6 mag, located at 15 pc.

Wait, so wait. The apparent magnitude is 15.5. So that's the observed m, which already includes extinction, right? Because if the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6, then we can calculate the intrinsic m.

Wait, perhaps the way it's structured, the apparent magnitude is the observed (m_observed =15.5), and the E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So the intrinsic m would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But then, the absolute magnitude M is 15.5, and the distance is 15 pc. So the m_intrinsic (without extinction) should be M +5 log10(15/10) =15.5 +5 *0.1761=15.5 +0.88=16.38.

Wait, but according to the observed m, m_observed=15.5, which is m_intrinsic +A_V=13.64+1.86=15.5. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the apparent magnitude without considering extinction is 13.64, which is way brighter. But the observed m is 15.5.

Wait, but wait. Because when you have a star at 15 pc, its apparent magnitude without extinction would be 16.38, and with extinction A_V=1.86, the observed m is 18.24. But according to the problem statement, the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. That can't be right. So perhaps I misunderstood which magnitude is given.

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given in the problem is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the E(B-V) is provided to calculate the observed m. Let me think again.

If the star's absolute magnitude is 15.5, located at 15 pc, then the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_intrinsic =15.5 +5 log10(15/10) =16.38.

Then, with extinction A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86, the observed m =16.38 +1.86=18.24.

But in the problem description, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. So that's conflicting. That suggests that the given apparent magnitude is after extinction. So perhaps in this case, the observed m is 15.5, and the E(B-V)=0.6.

So the intrinsic m would be m_intrinsic=15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But that can't be right because the absolute magnitude is 15.5. So perhaps the apparent magnitude is given as without extinction, and E(B-V) is given to compute the extinction.

But that would make the observed m=16.38 +1.86=18.24, which is way beyond both instruments' capabilities. So that would suggest that Star3 can't be detected by either, which seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is giving Star3's apparent magnitude as observed (including extinction), so m_observed=15.5.

In that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16 (for HIRES) and less than 17 (for ESPRESSO), so both can detect it.

But then, why is the distance and absolute magnitude given? It seems like a red herring. Because if the apparent magnitude is given, the distance and absolute magnitude don't matter for detection.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me approach each star step by step.

Star1: m=15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES can't detect (needs m<=16), ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m=15.5. Both can detect.

Star4: m=16.74. HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

So stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

So looking at the options:

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74, so no, HIRES can't see.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have m<=16 and <=17, so yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, which is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is detectable by both, Star4 only by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but Star1 is Star1: m=15.5, so both can detect. Star5: m=15.0, both can detect. So both Star1 and Star5 would be detectable by both.

But looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5, which are both detectable by both. Option D is Star1 and Star4, but Star4 is not detectable by both.

So the possible correct answers are Star3 and Star5 (option B) and Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but according to the initial analysis, Star1 has m=15.5, which is acceptable for both.

So which options include stars that have m<=16?

Looking again:

Star1: m=15.5 → both detect.

Star3: m=15.5 → both detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both detect.

So the possible correct pairs are Star1 and Star3, Star1 and Star5, Star3 and Star5, etc.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Option D is Star1 and Star4, but Star4 can't be detected by both. So option B is a possible correct.

Wait, but in the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. Star1 can be detected by both, but Star4 cannot (since its m=16.74 is >16). So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list each star's m.

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4: m=16.74 (after extinction) → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0 → detectable by both.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 no.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 no.

So the correct answer would include any pair of the three stars that are detectable by both.

Looking at the options, only option B (Star3 and Star5) is correct.

Wait, but wait. What about Star5's distance and absolute magnitude? Let me recalculate Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 * (-0.301)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m≈15.0.

E(B-V) is not given for Star5. So extinction isn't a factor here. So the observed m is 15.0. So Star5's m is 15.0, which is acceptable for both.

So Star1: m=15.5, detectable by both.

Star3: m=15.5, detectable.

Star5: m=15.0, detectable.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

The question is which pair is in the options.

Looking back:

Options are A)4 and5; B)3 and5; C)2 and3; D)1 and4.

So the correct pairs are B)3 and5, and D)1 and4 (but D is wrong because Star4 isn't detectable by both).

Wait, but option D is Star1 and Star4. Star4's m is 16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So only Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option. The options don't have a choice with Star1 and Star5.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me re-express all the m's.

Wait, another approach: for each star, can both instruments detect it?

Star1: m=15.5 → both can. Yes.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can. No.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can. Yes.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO. No.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can. Yes.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can. So yes.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → no.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it. Only ESPRESSO can detect it.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Intrinsic apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m = 16.74 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it. Only ESPRESSO can detect it.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the condition.

ANSWER: B
