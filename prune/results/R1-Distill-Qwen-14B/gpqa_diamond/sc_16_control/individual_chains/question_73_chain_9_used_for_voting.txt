Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for total energy, I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of both astronauts and sum them up.

Wait, let me think again. Relativistic velocity addition is a bit tricky. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but wait, I should make sure about the signs. Both are moving in the same direction, so I think the relative speed is the difference between their speeds divided by that factor.

Wait, no, more accurately, if object A is moving at u and object B at v relative to the same frame, then the velocity of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut 1 has a speed of 0.6c, astronaut 2 has 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, the relative speed of astronaut 2 is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the relative speed's magnitude is 0.1c, but wait the sign here is negative, which would imply direction. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed's magnitude is 0.1c. So the relative speed is 0.1c. But wait, looking at the options, B and C have 0.1c and 0.14c respectively.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c^2)). So if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c, then the relative speed of B as seen by A is (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Calculating numerator: 0.5 -0.6 = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. Oh, wait, but speed is a scalar, so magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So options C and D are possible.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by mc². So for each, calculate their gamma factors.

For astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². Wait, wait, no: the mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma_1 * (2m) c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma_2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 ≈3.4641 mc².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That matches. D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated.

Wait, but wait another thing. No, wait. The problem says "the total energy of the system." But wait, in relativity, when you're considering the total energy, you shouldn't just add the energies as measured in the same frame. Because the energy of each astronaut is already measured in the same frame, the lab frame. So adding them would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem is about the total energy of the system, so yes, each astronaut's energy in the lab frame is to be summed. So E_total = E1 + E2. As I calculated, around 5.96 mc². So option C is the one with E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c.

Wait, but wait another thing. The relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct answer would be option C. Let me check the options again.

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. Yes.

So the two calculations match. So the correct answer would be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts. The formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \(0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut 1:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For Astronaut 2:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
