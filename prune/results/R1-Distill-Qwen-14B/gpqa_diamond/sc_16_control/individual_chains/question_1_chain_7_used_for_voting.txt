Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with the lifetimes of energy states. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. Specifically, the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant.

So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes they just use ΔE * Δt ≈ h/(4π). I need to get that straight. Wait, ħ is h divided by 2π. So, h/(4π) is ħ/2. So both expressions are equivalent.

So the lifetime of a state is related to the uncertainty in energy. If a state has a short lifetime, the energy is uncertain — meaning it's spread out more. Conversely, a longer lifetime means a more precise energy measurement because the uncertainty is smaller.

In this problem, we have two states with different lifetimes. Wait, no, actually, each state has its own lifetime. So the first state's energy is uncertain by ΔE1, and the second state's energy is uncertain by ΔE2. But how does this affect the energy difference between the two?

Wait, the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So we need their energy difference to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps each uncertainty is the uncertainty for each state, and the minimal detectable difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy uncertainty for each state. Each state has a certain precision in energy. The energy levels must be separated by more than the sum of the uncertainties for us to distinguish them clearly. Otherwise, the separation might be lost in the noise, so to speak.

So the uncertainty in energy for each state is roughly given by ΔE = ħ / (2Δt), I think. Wait, wait, I might have that formula wrong. Another approach: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

So let's compute that for each state.

First state: Δt1 = 1e-9 sec
So ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9) = (h/(2π)) / (2e-9) = h/(4 π e-9)

Wait, but maybe I should just calculate it numerically.

Wait, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So for the first state:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9) = (1.055e-34) / (2e-9) = (1.055 / 2) * 1e-25 J.

Calculating 1.055 / 2 is about 0.5275. So 0.5275e-25 J. To convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

0.5275e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (0.5275 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ 0.329e-6 eV = 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, let me redo the math more carefully.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 5.272859e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602176634e-19 J) ) = approx (5.272859e-26 / 1.602e-19) eV.

Calculate that: 5.27e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (5.27 / 1.6) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) ) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.6e-19 = (5.27 / 1.6) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV for the first state and 3.29e-8 eV for the second.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the second state's lifetime is longer, so its energy uncertainty should be smaller. Let me just double-check: Yes, the first state has a shorter lifetime, so larger ΔE. The second has a longer lifetime, so smaller ΔE.

So now, to distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 (assuming E2>E1) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Wait, or is it that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in each state?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum detectable energy difference is on the order of the uncertainty of each, but since we're comparing two states, perhaps the total uncertainty in the measurement would be the sum of the uncertainties of each.

Wait, maybe the combined uncertainty is the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. So for the energy difference, ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV

ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Adding these together: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than approximately 3.619e-7 eV. So looking at the options, which one is larger than this?

Looking back at the options:

A) 10^-9 eV = 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.0001e-7 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Hmm, 0.0001 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is 1e4 times 1e-8. Wait no, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV = 1e4 * 1e-8 eV? Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is larger than 3.6e-7 (which is 0.00000036). So 1e-4 eV is 0.0001, which is bigger than 0.00000036. So this would be much larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV, which is 0.0001 times 1e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is 1e-8, which is 3.6e-7 eV is 3.6 times larger than 1e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7, meaning that the energy difference would be 1e-8 eV, which is less than the uncertainty, so not distinguishable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So the required ΔE (difference) needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties, which is ~3.6e-7 eV.

So looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV → so it would be clearly resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV → too small.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but another thought: if each state's uncertainty is ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the minimal energy difference to resolve them would be on the order of the maximum of the two uncertainties, not the sum. Or perhaps the sum? Because when you have two states each with their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty when comparing the two would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because you have to account for both.

For example, if you have two measurements, each with their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty when comparing them would be the sum.

So in this case, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

So in that case, the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. The other options are much smaller.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem statement says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So perhaps the minimal detectable ΔE is the sum of their uncertainties. So, in that case, any ΔE larger than that sum is resolvable.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Compared to 3.6e-7 eV, that's 278 times larger, which is well above the threshold.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy uncertainties for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \cdot 10^{-9}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot 10^{-8}} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \cdot 10^{-8}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy for both states:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the given options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be at least \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), and the only option that satisfies this is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
