Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit odd. So, it's a 2-dimensional metric because there are only dx and dy terms. Oh right, because the pseudosphere in 2D would have a metric like this.

Wait, but pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D, but here we're probably dealing with the intrinsic geometry, right? So, the metric represents the intrinsic geometry of the pseudosphere.

Wait, but how does this metric look? Let me see. The general form for a metric in 2D can be written as ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ² + cross terms, but this one is written in terms of x and y. Hmm, maybe it's a coordinate system where x and y are like radial coordinates or something else.

Wait, perhaps this is conformally flat because it's expressed as a function times (dx² + dy²). So, g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So, the metric is diagonal.

I remember that for a metric in conformal form, like ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula involving the Laplacian of φ. But wait, in this case, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me note that as λ: λ = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The formula for Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric is K = - (1/(2 e^{2φ})) * Laplacian(e^{2φ}) ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard formula. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the Gaussian curvature from the metric.

Alternatively, another approach: The metric is conformally flat, so the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - [ (e^φ)_{,rs} e^{-φ} ].

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think. For a 2D metric in conformal coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2φ})) [ e^{2φ} ]_{,rr} - (1/(2 e^{2φ})) [ e^{2φ} ]_{,θθ} } 

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it using the formula for curvature in 2D. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = g_{ab} dx^a dx^b can be found using the formula:

K = (1/(2g)) [ (dg_x/dy - dg_y/dx) ] 

Wait, no, that's the formula for the scalar curvature in 2D when using isothermal coordinates, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for K when the metric is conformally flat is:

K = - (1/4) (ln(g) )_{,rr} - (1/(4 g)) (g_{,θ} )^2 + ... 

Wait, maybe I should compute it using the standard formula. Another approach: The Gaussian curvature can be found using the Christoffel symbols. But maybe that's a bit involved.

Alternatively, let me think about the metric given. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space. Wait, hyperbolic space in 2D has a metric like dr² + (1/k²) dθ², but that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, when expressed in a different coordinate system, maybe it looks like this.

Wait, the standard metric for hyperbolic space can be written in the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has the metric ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Comparing this with the given metric, the given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, if we let x² + y² = r², then the denominator is 4 - r². So, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²). Let me see: 32 is 8*4, or perhaps it's 8*(4) divided by (4 - r²). Wait, 32/(4 - r²) is (32/4)/(1 - (r²)/4) ) = 8/(1 - (r²)/4 ) = 8 * (1/(1 - (r²)/4 )).

Wait, the Poincaré disk model's metric is (4/(1 - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, no, wait, I think I might have mixed something up. Let me think again. The Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk, and the curvature is -1/(a^2) where a is the radius. Or wait, perhaps the curvature is related to the parameter in the metric.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the curvature is K = -1/(a^2), and the metric is ds² = (4 a²/(4 a² (1 - r²/a²)^2 )) (dr² + r² dθ²) )? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric can be compared to the standard hyperbolic metric.

Wait, the standard hyperbolic metric in the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radius from the center. So, comparing to the given metric, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me write x² + y² = r², so the denominator is 4 - r². So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²) = 8/( (4 - r²)/4 ) = 8 * (4/(4 - r²)). So, 32/(4 - r²) = (8 * 4 ) / (4 - r²) ) = 32/(4 - r²). Alternatively, let's think in terms of scaling.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has a scale factor of (1 - r²)^(-1), but here the scale factor is (4 - r²)^(-1), which is similar but scaled. Let me factor out the 4 in the denominator: 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r²)/4 ). So, the conformal factor becomes 32/(4 (1 - (r^2)/4 )) ) = 8/(1 - (r^2)/4 ). So, ds² = 8/(1 - (r^2)/4 ) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that looks similar to the Poincaré metric but scaled.

Wait, in the Poincaré model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²). So, in our case, the conformal factor is 8/(1 - (r²)/4 ), which can be rewritten as 8 * [1/(1 - (r²)/4)] = 8 * [ (4/(4 - r^2) ) ].

Wait, but the metric in our problem is 32/(4 - r^2) (dr² + r² dθ²) if we switch to polar coordinates. Because dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So, the given metric is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - r²) ] (dr² + r² dθ²)

Wait, that's the same as (32) * [1/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Hmm, the standard Poincaré model has a metric where the conformal factor is (4/(1 - r²)^2). So to compare, let me see.

Wait, if I make a substitution: let r' = r/(2), so r = 2 r'. Then, r² = 4 r'². Then, 4 - r² =4(1 - r'²). So,

ds² = [32/(4(1 - r'²)) ] [dr² + r² dθ²] = (8/(1 - r'²)) (dr² + (4 r'²) dθ² )

Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric.

In 2D, the Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula:

K = -(1/(2√g)) [ (∂/∂x √g * g_{xx} ) - ... ] ?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the Gaussian curvature when the metric is in conformal form. The formula is:

K = - (1/(4)) [ (∂² ln f)/(∂x²) + (∂² ln f)/(∂y²) ]

Where f is the conformal factor. Wait, wait, the general formula for the Gaussian curvature in 2D when the metric is ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is given by:

K = - (1/(2 f)) [ ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² ] + (1/(4 f)) [ (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2 ].

Alternatively, another formula I found is:

K = (1/(4 f)) [ Δ(f) ] where Δ is the Laplacian.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature using the metric given.

Given f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So, ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

Compute the Laplacian of ln f.

Laplacian is the sum of second derivatives with respect to x and y.

So,

ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²).

First, compute the first derivatives:

d(ln f)/dx = [ 0 - (1/(4 - r²)) * (-2x) ) ] = (2x)/(4 - r²).

Similarly, d(ln f)/dy = (2y)/(4 - r²).

Now, compute the second derivatives.

d²(ln f)/dx² = [ 2(4 - r²) - 2x*(-2x) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let me do that step by step.

d/dx [ (2x)/(4 - r²) ) ] 

Because r² = x² + y², so dr²/dx = 2x.

So,

d/dx (2x/(4 - r²)) = [ 2 (4 - r²) - 2x ( -2x ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ (8 - 2 r²) + (4 x²) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the derivative is d/dx [2x * (4 - r²)^{-1} ].

Using the product rule:

= 2*(4 - r²)^{-1} + 2x * (-1)*(4 - r²)^{-2} * d/dx (4 - r²)

d/dx (4 - r²) = -2x.

So,

= 2/(4 - r²) + 2x * (-1) * (-2x) / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify:

= 2/(4 - r²) + (4 x²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Similarly, the second derivative with respect to y would be:

d²(ln f)/dy² = 2/(4 - r²) + (4 y²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Adding the two second derivatives together for the Laplacian:

Δ(ln f) = [2/(4 - r²) + 4x²/(4 - r²)^2 ] + [2/(4 - r²) + 4y²/(4 - r²)^2 ]

= [4/(4 - r²)] + [4(x² + y²)]/(4 - r²)^2.

But x² + y² = r², so:

= 4/(4 - r²) + 4 r²/(4 - r²)^2.

Factor out 4/(4 - r²)^2:

= 4/(4 - r²)^2 [ (4 - r²) + r² ]

Because:

4/(4 - r²) = [4 (4 - r²) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

So,

= [4 (4 - r²) + 4 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= [ 16 -4 r² +4 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= 16 / (4 - r²)^2.

So, the Laplacian of ln f is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is (1/(4 f)) * Δ(ln f), I think. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, let me recall the formula.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K for a metric f(dx² + dy²) is given by:

K = (1/(4 f)) * [ ∂² ln f/∂x² + ∂² ln f/∂y² ].

Alternatively, another source says the formula is:

K = - (1/(2 f)) [ ∂² f/∂x² + ∂² f/∂y² ] + (1/(4 f)) [ (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps using that would be better.

Let me compute that.

Compute the second derivatives of f:

f = 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Compute ∂² f/∂x² and ∂² f/∂y².

First, compute ∂f/∂x = (32)(2x)/(4 - r²)^2.

Because d/dx (1/(4 - r²)) )= (2x)/(4 - r²)^2.

So, ∂f/∂x = (64 x)/(4 - r²)^2.

Similarly, ∂f/∂y = (64 y)/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, compute the second derivatives:

∂² f/∂x² = derivative of (64 x)/(4 - r²)^2 with respect to x.

Again, r² = x² + y², so dr²/dx = 2x.

Let me compute:

d/dx [64 x (4 - r²)^(-2) ]

= 64 (4 - r²)^(-2) + 64 x * (-2) (4 - r²)^(-3) * (-2x)

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 + 64 x * 2x * 2/(4 - r²)^3

Wait, let me compute it more carefully.

Using product rule:

= 64 (4 - r²)^(-2) + 64 x * [ d/dx (4 - r²)^(-2) ]

d/dx (4 - r²)^(-2) = (-2)(4 - r²)^(-3) * (-2x) ) = (4x)/(4 - r²)^3.

Because d/dx (4 - r²) = -2x, so d/dx (4 - r²)^(-2) = (-2)(-2x) (4 - r²)^(-3) )= (4x)/(4 - r²)^3.

So,

∂² f/∂x² = 64/(4 - r²)^2 + 64 x * (4x)/(4 - r²)^3 )

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ 1 + (4 x²)/(4 - r²) ) ]

Similarly,

∂² f/∂y² = 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ 1 + (4 y²)/(4 - r²) ) ]

So, summing ∂² f/∂x² + ∂² f/∂y²:

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ 2 + (4(x² + y²))/(4 - r²) ) ]

But x² + y² = r², so:

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ 2 + (4 r²)/(4 - r²) )

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ (2 (4 - r²) ) + 4 r² ) / (4 - r²) ) ]

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ (8 - 2 r² +4 r² ) / (4 - r²) ) ]

= 64/(4 - r²)^2 [ (8 + 2 r² ) / (4 - r²) ) ]

= 64 (8 + 2 r² ) / (4 - r²)^3.

Now, compute the other part: (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2.

Each is (64 x)/(4 - r²)^2 and similar for y.

So,

(∂f/∂x)^2 = (64 x)^2/(4 - r²)^4 = (4096 x²)/(4 - r²)^4.

Similarly for y.

So, sum is [4096 (x² + y²)]/(4 - r²)^4.

Which is [4096 r² ]/(4 - r²)^4.

So, putting it all into the curvature formula:

K = (1/(4 f) ) [ (∂² f/∂x² + ∂² f/∂y² ) ] - (1/(4 f)) [ (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2 ].

Wait, no, the formula is:

K = (1/(4 f)) [ ∂² ln f/∂x² + ∂² ln f/∂y² ].

Wait, earlier I computed the Laplacian of ln f as 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So then,

K = (1/(4 f)) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= (16)/(4 f (4 - r²)^2 )

But f = 32/(4 - r²), so substituting:

= (16) / [4 * (32/(4 - r²)) ) * (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify denominator:

4 * 32/(4 - r²) * (4 - r²)^2 = 4*32*(4 - r²)

So,

K = 16 / [ 4 * 32 (4 - r²) ) ] 

= 16 / [128 (4 - r²) ]

= (1/8) / (4 - r² )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 16/(4*32*(4 - r²)) )= 16/(128 (4 - r²) )= 1/(8 (4 - r²) ).

Hmm, but that would mean the curvature depends on r, which doesn't make sense for a pseudosphere which should have constant curvature. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Since the metric is conformally flat, the scalar curvature should be constant if it's a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature). So perhaps the mistake is in the computation of K.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature in another way. Let me think about the metric.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see if this is equivalent to the metric of a pseudosphere.

Wait, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. So, perhaps the given metric has constant curvature.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is:

ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ² )

Which has Gaussian curvature K = -1.

Wait, so comparing to our given metric, which is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² )

So, in terms of the Poincaré model, this would be:

ds² = (32)/(4 (1 - (r²)/4 )) (dr² + r² dθ² ) 

= (8)/(1 - (r²)/4 ) (dr² + r² dθ² )

Comparing to the Poincaré model:

ds² = (4/(1 - r'^2)^2 ) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )

where r' is some scaled radius.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is a scaled version of the Poincaré model. So, let me let r' = r/(2), so that r = 2 r'.

Then, 1 - (r^2)/4 = 1 - ( (2 r')^2 )/4 = 1 - r'^2.

Then, the given metric becomes:

ds² = (8)/(1 - r'^2) ( (2 dr')^2 + (2 r')^2 (dθ)^2 )

Wait, because dr = 2 dr', and r = 2 r', so r² = 4 r'^2.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to see that the given metric's conformal factor is (32)/(4−r^2) = 8/(1 − r^2/4) = 8 times (1/(1 − (r^2/4))).

Which is similar to the Poincaré metric, which has a denominator (1−r^2)^2. Hmm, perhaps it's a different scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature another way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the metric in terms of isothermal coordinates. The given metric is conformally flat, so it's in isothermal form. The Gaussian curvature for a metric in the form ds² = f(dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/2) Δ(ln f ), where Δ is the Laplacian.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Let me recheck.

Yes, Gaussian curvature K = -(1/2) Δ(ln f).

Because I'm getting a bit stuck here, perhaps I should compute this.

So, K = -(1/2) Δ(ln f), where f = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So, as before, ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

So, the Laplacian of ln f is the sum of the second derivatives with respect to x and y.

Earlier, I computed that the Laplacian of ln f is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So,

K = -(1/2) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

= -8/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, that gives K as a function of r, which varies with position. That can't be, because a pseudosphere should have constant curvature everywhere.

Hmm, that suggests I've made a mistake. Because a pseudosphere must have constant curvature. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't in isothermal coordinates, but another form. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the Laplacian.

Wait, let me compute the Laplacian again.

ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y² ) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

So first derivatives:

d(ln f)/dx = (2x)/(4 - r² )

d(ln f)/dy = (2y)/(4 - r² )

Second derivatives:

d²(ln f)/dx² = [ 2 (4 - r²) - 2x*(-2x) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

d/dx [ (2x)/(4 - r²) ) ].

Because r² = x² + y², so dr²/dx = 2x.

So, using the quotient rule:

d/dx [ (2x)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [2*(4 - r²) - 2x * ( -2x ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ 8 - 2 r² +4x² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Similarly, d²(ln f)/dy² = [8 - 2 r² +4 y² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Adding them:

Δ(ln f) = [8 - 2 r² +4x² +8 - 2 r² +4 y² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= [16 -4 r² +4(x² + y²) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

But x² + y² = r², so:

= [16 -4 r² +4 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So, yes, that's correct. So, K = -(1/2) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 ) = -8/(4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, that suggests that the curvature varies with r, which contradicts the expectation of a pseudosphere with constant curvature. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic space, which has constant negative curvature. So, perhaps the area is being calculated for a hyperbolic plane, not a pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is a finite area surface with constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere is finite. For example, the tractricoid has finite area. But the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. Wait, but that depends on whether the given metric is for a compact space or not.

Wait, looking back at the metric: the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So, x² + y² must be less than 4 for the metric to be real. So, the domain is a disk of radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane. So, the 'spatial' slice is x² + y² <4. So, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2.

Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the metric would extend over a compact surface, like the tractricoid, which is a surface of revolution with finite area. But the given metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, which is compact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a hyperbolic space of radius R=2. Wait, for hyperbolic space with curvature K = -1/(R^2), where R is the radius.

So, let's compute K in terms of R.

Wait, if the metric is for a hyperbolic plane of radius R=2, then the Gaussian curvature would be K = -1/(R²) = -1/4.

But according to our earlier computation, K = -8/(4 - r²)^2, which depends on r, not a constant. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the given metric is not the standard hyperbolic metric but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere in question is a surface embedded in 3D space, but the given metric is for a 2D space, which is a different approach.

Wait, the question is: What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?

Pseudosphere in 2D (like the tractrix of revolution) has a finite area. For example, the tractricoid has area 4π. So, perhaps the given metric is the metric of a pseudosphere of radius 2, and the area would be 4π. Let's see.

Wait, the answer options are: A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, but the area can't depend on x and y; it's a global property. So options B and C can't be correct. So the area must be a constant. So options A, D, or 4π.

Wait, but the options don't have 4π as an option. Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, but the user made a typo, perhaps. Because the correct area of a pseudosphere is 4π a², where a is the 'radius' (though in the case of a pseudosphere, the concept of radius is a bit different but perhaps analogous to the sphere's radius). For a sphere, the area is 4π r². So, for a pseudosphere of radius r=2, the area would be 4π (2)^2 = 16π.

But 16π isn't an option either. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is finite but not necessarily 4π.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. The options don't have 16π. So perhaps it's 4π, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the metric given represents a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the area would be infinite, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought the domain was a disk of radius 2, which is compact. So, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic space that is compactified on a disk of radius 2, but that doesn't make sense because compactifying would imply a finite area, but hyperbolic space is non-compact and has infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is a conformally transformed metric of the hyperbolic plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the given metric has a singularity at x² + y²=4. So, the domain is x² + y² <4. So, it's a 2D surface that is topologically a disk, but with hyperbolic geometry.

In that case, it's a model of hyperbolic space on a disk of radius 2, which would have infinite area because as you approach the boundary, the geometry becomes infinitely curved.

Wait, but the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, yes. So the area would be +infty, which is option D.

But wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented on a disk, but the area is still infinite because the metric blows up at the boundary. So the area is infinite.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D) +infty.

But I'm a bit confused because the pseudosphere is a compact surface, but the given metric seems to represent an unbounded space.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the area of the surface using the given metric.

The area can be computed as the integral over the domain of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor.

In 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal, g_xy=0, so the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy ) dx dy = sqrt( [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2 ) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area is the integral over the domain x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, that integral might be tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates. So, x = r cosθ, y= r sinθ. Then, dx dy= r dr dθ.

So,

Area = ∫ (r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Pull out constants:

= 32 ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the integrals.

First, the θ integral:

∫ (0 to 2π) dθ = 2π.

Second, compute ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So,

∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ 1/u ] * (-1/2) du.

= (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

= (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

= (-1/2) (ln 0 - ln4 ) → ln 0 is -infty, so this becomes (-1/2)(-infty - ln4 ) → +infty.

So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the answer is D) +infty.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric written in conformal form, where the conformal factor is \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. The problem asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

1. **Nature of the Metric**: The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is proportional to the Euclidean metric. The conformal factor \( f(x, y) \) determines the geometry of the space. For \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), the metric is well-defined, but it diverges at the boundary \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \).

2. **Gaussian Curvature**: For a conformal metric \( ds^2 = f(dx^2 + dy^2) \), the Gaussian curvature \( K \) is given by:
   \[
   K = -\frac{1}{2} \Delta \ln f,
   \]
   where \( \Delta \) is the Laplacian operator. Computing \( \ln f = \ln(32) - \ln(4 - x^2 - y^2) \), the Laplacian of \( \ln f \) yields:
   \[
   \Delta \ln f = \frac{16}{(4 - x^2 - y^2)^2}.
   \]
   Substituting this into the formula for \( K \), the curvature becomes:
   \[
   K = -\frac{8}{(4 - x^2 - y^2)^2}.
   \]
   This shows that the curvature varies with position, which suggests the space is hyperbolic but not a pseudosphere, as a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of a 2-dimensional surface with metric \( ds^2 = f(dx^2 + dy^2) \) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \int \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy.
   \]
   For this metric, \( \det g = f^2 \), so the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]
   Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area integral becomes:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   The angular integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 64 \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
   \]
   This integral diverges as \( u \to 0 \), indicating that the area is infinite.

4. **Interpretation**: The given metric represents a hyperbolic space compactified on a disk of radius 2. While the pseudosphere is a finite-area surface with constant negative curvature, the metric here corresponds to a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area due to the divergence of the metric at the boundary.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect. The area is clearly not zero.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \))**: Incorrect. The area is a global property and cannot depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \))**: Incorrect. Similar to Option B, the area cannot depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct. The metric diverges at the boundary of the disk, leading to an infinite area.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
