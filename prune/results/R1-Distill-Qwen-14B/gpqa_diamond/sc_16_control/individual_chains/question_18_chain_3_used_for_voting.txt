Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the problem again.

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, does the mass matter here? The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is a red herring, or perhaps it's a hint for another approach, but I'm not sure. I'll focus on the given abundances.

The given data are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I'm looking for [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or maybe the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to something.

Wait, no. The question is the ratio of silicon atoms in each star's photosphere. So, perhaps we're to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) or something like that. Or maybe the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen ratios, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Let me first understand what the given abundance values mean. The notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, for example, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe to H abundance compared to the Sun.

So for Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] = log(Fe/H star) - log(Fe/H sun) = 0. So Fe/H star = Fe/H sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So this is the logarithm of (Si/Fe)_star1 divided by (Si/Fe)_sun. So [A/B] = log(n_A/n_B) - log(n_A/n_B)_sun.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So that would mean (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun. Because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y / n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) = log( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun /n_Y_sun) ) ) = log( (n_X /n_Y) ) - log( (n_X_sun /n_Y_sun) )

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

Wait, let's compute (Si/Fe)_sun for the Sun. The Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH_sun) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH_sun = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, the Sun's log(nMg/nH) is given as 12 + log(...) =7 → log(nMg/nH_sun) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH_sun = 1e-5.

Wait no, wait. The way it's written is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write it right.

Wait, the problem states:

"Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7."

So, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, for the Sun, nFe/nH_sun =1e-4.5, nMg/nH_sun=1e-5.

Then, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H = Fe/H_sun. So, nFe/nH_1 = nFe/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun. So, (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun = [log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun] = 0 for the Sun. So [Si/Fe]_sun =0, meaning that (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nFe)_sun, which they already are.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual n_Si in each star.

Let's see. For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1=0, which means that the ratio Fe/H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH_1.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is (Fe/H)_sun * nH_1. Wait, no, nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nH_sun. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me define the Sun's n as:

nFe_sun = F

nMg_sun = M

nH_sun = H.

So, from the Sun's data:

F/H = 1e-4.5.

M/H =1e-5.

So F = 1e-4.5 * H.

M = 1e-5 * H.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = F/H = 1e-4.5.

So nFe_1 = (1e-4.5) * nH_1.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) +0.3.

nSi_sun /nFe_sun = (nSi_sun) / F.

But I don't have nSi_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H], but not sure.

Wait, [Si/Fe] is the logarithm of (Si/Fe)_star / (Si/Fe)_sun. So for Star_1, (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

Since (Si/Fe)_sun = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

And for Star_1, nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (Si/Fe)_1.

But nFe_1 = (F/H_sun) * (nH_sun / nH_1) )? Wait, no, because [Fe/H]_1=0, so nFe_1 = (F/H_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, let me think again.

Because [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(F/H_sun) =0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(F/H_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 = F/H_sun → nFe_1 = (F/H_sun) *nH_1.

So, nFe_1 = (F/H_sun) *nH_1.

And for [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1: nSi_1 = (F/H_sun) *nH_1 * (nSi_sun/F) *10^0.3.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

nFe_1 = (F/H_sun) * nH_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * [ (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 ]

= (F/H_sun) * nH_1 * (nSi_sun / F) * 10^0.3

Simplify: F cancels.

= (nSi_sun / H_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3 * (1/H_sun) * H_sun ?

Wait, (F/H_sun) is (F/(H_sun)).

So, (F/H_sun) * (nSi_sun /F) = (nSi_sun)/(H_sun).

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / H_sun) * nH_1 *10^0.3.

But nSi_sun is the number of Si atoms in the Sun. So, H_sun is the number of H atoms in the Sun.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the ratio nSi_1 / nH_1.

From above, nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / H_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

So,

nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nSi_sun / H_sun) * 10^0.3.

Which is (nSi_sun / H_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log( (nSi_1/nH_1) ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) )

= log( (nSi_sun / H_sun *10^0.3 *nH_1 /nH_1 ) ) / (nSi_sun / H_sun) )

Wait, nH_1 is in the numerator and denominator, so it cancels.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

We can find the [Si/H] for Star_1.

We have [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 (Si/Fe)_sun.

So, (Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe/H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun * (Fe/H)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun * (Fe/H)_sun = (Si/H)_sun.

So, (Si/H)_1 =10^0.3 * (Si/H)_sun.

Which means that [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 dex.

So, the abundance of Si in Star_1 relative to H is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

So, (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_2.

But (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3*(Mg/Si)_sun.

So,

(Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

Thus,

(Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun = 10^0.3 * [ (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun ].

But (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2.

Since (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun,

So,

(Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

Cancel (Mg/H)_sun from both sides,

1/(Si/H)_2 = 10^0.3 / (Si/H)_sun.

So,

(Si/H)_2 = (Si/H)_sun * (1/10^0.3).

Which means,

(Si/H)_2 = (Si/H)_sun * 10^(-0.3).

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

Wait, that's interesting.

So, for Star_1, [Si/H] is +0.3, and for Star_2, it's -0.3.

Wait, but the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So, perhaps we're to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) divided by (n_H,1 / n_H,2) ?

Wait, no. The question is the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Or, perhaps the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen ratios.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, perhaps (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) divided by (n_H,1 / n_H,2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: perhaps the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 /n_H,2), which is ( [Si/H]_1 + log10 factor ) compared to ( [Si/H]_2 + log factor ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's compute [Si/H] for both stars.

Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Star_2: [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Because [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi,nH_sun). So,

Star_1: log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) +0.3.

Star_2: log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = 10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3) ) = 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98.

Wait, that would be 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98, so around 4. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would align with that.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So, does that mean (n_Si1 / n_Si2) ?

But no, because n_Si is relative to H in each star. Oh wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_Si1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Si2 / n_H2) ), which is exactly what I calculated.

Because that would be (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1), which could represent the ratio considering the different hydrogen amounts. But I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is just asking for (n_Si1 / n_Si2), but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen ratios. Let me recheck the question.

The question says: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps just the ratio of their [Si/H] values.

Wait, but if that's the case, Star_1 [Si/H] is +0.3, Star_2 is -0.3. So the ratio is 10^0.3 /10^(-0.3) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

So the answer would be A) ~3.9.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem may require the ratio of the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for each star, so (n_Si1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Si2 / n_H2) ), which is ( [Si/H]_1 + [Si/H]_sun ) / ( [Si/H]_2 + [Si/H]_sun ) ? Wait, no, [Si/H] is the difference from the Sun.

Wait, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun /nH_sun).

So, [X/H]_1 = 0.3 → log(nX1/nH1) = log(nX_sun /nH_sun) +0.3.

So, nX1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * (nX_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, nX2/nH2 = 10^(-0.3) * (nX_sun/nH_sun).

So, the ratio (nX1/nH1)/(nX2/nH2) )= (10^0.3)/(10^-0.3) )=10^0.6= ~3.98.

So, this ratio is about 3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = Fe/H_sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H = Mg/H_sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun.

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5 → nFe/nH_sun = 10^-4.5.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH)_sun = -5 → nMg/nH_sun = 10^-5.

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.
- Thus, nSi_1/nH_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 × (Fe/H)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/H)_sun.

#### Star_2:
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun.
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.
- Thus, (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2 → (Si/H)_2 = (Si/H)_sun × 10^-0.3.

#### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Star_1}}}{(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Star_2}}}.
\]

Substituting the values:
- (nSi/nH)_Star_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi/nH)_sun.
- (nSi/nH)_Star_2 = 10^-0.3 × (nSi/nH)_sun.

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
