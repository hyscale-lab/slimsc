Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and the geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But here, the matrix is a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ projectors.

Wait, I should probably write this out as a matrix to visualize it better. So |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Oh right, so ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

I remember that for single qubit states, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, called the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) is a way to represent the state. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) where the state is (x, y, z) normalized in some way.

Wait, how is the Bloch vector derived from the density matrix? Oh right, the density matrix ρ can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector.

So let's apply that. If ρ is given as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )/2, then ρ is equal to (I)/2 because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix for a single qubit. So substituting into the equation, (I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Oh wait, because both sides are multiplied by 1/2, so the identity matrix equals (I + r·σ). So subtracting I from both sides, 0 = r·σ. That implies r·σ is zero. So the only solution is r being zero? Because any non-zero r would contribute something to the matrix, right?

Alternatively, if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ is zero, so ρ becomes I/2. Which matches the given ρ. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That means the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere. But wait, isn't that the completely mixed state? Because for a pure state, the Bloch vector would have length 1, and for a mixed state, it's somewhere inside. In this case, ρ is a completely mixed state because it's ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ), which has maximum entropy and no coherence.

So looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the correct position.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For single-qubit states, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere using the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\). The general form of the density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is the vector of Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it follows that \(r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that the Bloch vector \(r\) must be \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state with no coherence.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\) represents the completely mixed state.
