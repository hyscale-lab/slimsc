Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, so apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so ≤16. So a star needs to be detectable by both, meaning it must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 because that's the stricter condition between the two.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: It has an absolute V mag of 15.5, and it's at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, its apparent mag is same as absolute, so 15.5. That's within both telescopes' limits. So ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it. Wait, but wait: is that correct? Because sometimes interstellar extinction (dust) affects apparent magnitude. But for Star1, there's no mention of E(B-V), so I think we assume no extinction, so apparent mag is 15.5. So yeah, both can detect it.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. Hmm, HIRES can go up to 16, which is brighter than 16.5. Wait, no, wait: the question says HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. Wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is 16.5 mag, which is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it. Because HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, which is up to 16 (apparent mag <=16). So Star2's 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. So it can't be detected with both. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 is ≤17).

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V)=0.6). The total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V) which is 3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude after extinction is m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction. Wait, no, the extinction makes the star appear fainter, so the apparent mag increases. Wait, the apparent magnitude is what's observed. But wait, in the question, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's before extinction? Or is that after? Hmm, wait, I think the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude would be higher (dimmer) by the extinction. So the actual apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36. Because extinction (dust) makes stars appear dimmer, which means higher magnitude. So Star3's observed V mag is around 17.36.

Wait, but wait: The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc, and E(B-V)=0.6." Oh wait, no, apparent V mag is the observed, or is it the intrinsic? Wait, no, when you have E(B-V), you can calculate the extinction in V band, which adds to the apparent magnitude. Let me clarify.

Wait, stars have an intrinsic (absolute) magnitude M, but if there is extinction, the apparent magnitude m is M + distance modulus + extinction. Alternatively, when a star's light passes through interstellar medium, it loses brightness (so appears dimmer, higher m). So the apparent magnitude observed is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where A_V is the extinction in V band, which is 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, I think the given apparent magnitude is after considering the extinction. Or wait, no. The way the problem is written: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6". Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed m, not the intrinsic. But then, we don't have any way to compute the true m without extinction. Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude in the absence of extinction is 15.5, but with extinction, it's 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36.

Wait, the question states: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So the extinction in V (A_V) is 3.1 × E(B−V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. But wait, the m_intrinsic is the apparent magnitude without extinction, or the absolute magnitude? Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is m0. But with extinction, the apparent magnitude becomes m = m0 + A_V. So for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. So if that's the m0, then the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So that is fainter than both ESPRESSO and HIRES limits. Because HIRES can go up to 16, ESPRESSO up to 17. So Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is fainter than both. So neither telescope can detect it. Or wait, no. Wait, maybe the given apparent magnitude is the observed (so already includes extinction), but then E(B-V) is given. Wait, that's unclear. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is the intrinsic (without extinction) and we have to calculate the observed magnitude. So if m0 is 15.5, then m = m0 + A_V =15.5+1.86=17.36. Then, both telescopes can't see it. Because 17.36 is fainter than both limits.

Wait, but the way Star3 is worded: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." Oh, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is without extinction, and the E(B-V) affects the actual apparent magnitude (so the star is dimmer). So in that case, m_observed is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But wait, if the star is at 15 pc, and assuming no extinction, its apparent magnitude would be M + 5 log10(15/10) = 15.5 + 5 log(1.5). Let me compute that: log(1.5) is about 0.176, so 5 * 0.176 ≈ 0.88. So apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 +0.88=16.38. Then, with extinction of 1.86, m_observed is 16.38 +1.86=18.24. Hmm, that's even fainter. But wait, that's if the absolute magnitude is 15.5. Wait, no, the way it's written: Star3's absolute magnitude is not given. Wait, no.

Wait, the question says: "Star3 - RA = 11h and DEC =48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5. So that's the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. So if I have E(B-V)=0.6, then A_V=1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = m_observed - A_V =15.5-1.86=13.64. Then, the apparent magnitude without extinction is 13.64, which is brighter than both telescopes' limits. But that's not right because the star's distance is 15 pc.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Maybe the apparent magnitude given is the observed, so including the extinction. So for Star3, m_observed =15.5. Then, without extinction, it would have been m0 =15.5 - 1.86=13.64. But the distance is 15 pc, so its absolute magnitude is M = m0 - 5 log10(15/10) =13.64 - 5 * 0.176=13.64-0.88=12.76. But that's not directly needed here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's focus on the observed apparent magnitude. For Star3, the observed m is 15.5. But wait, extinction would make it appear fainter. So if the observed m is 15.5, then without extinction, it would be m0 =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's not relevant for the telescopes because the telescopes would see it as 15.5, which is within both's limits (since 15.5 ≤16 and ≤17). So Star3 would be detectable by both. Wait, but this contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. The confusion is whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not. The problem states for Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So that implies that the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86. To find the intrinsic (unreddened) magnitude, you subtract A_V, so m0=15.5-1.86=13.64. But that's the apparent magnitude if there were no extinction. But the observed magnitude is 15.5. So in reality, the star's observed V mag is 15.5, which is within both telescopes' limits (since 15.5 ≤16 and ≤17). So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, and regardless of extinction, that's the observed value. So for detecting, the observed m must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Since 15.5 is ≤16, both can detect it. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the E(B-V) is given. So if the star's light is affected by extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the star's actual brightness. So if without extinction, the star would be at 15.5 -1.86=13.64 mag. But the observed is 15.5, which is what the telescope sees. So the telescope's detectability is based on the observed apparent magnitude. So if the observed m is 15.5, that's what matters. So for ESPRESSO and HIRES, the observed m must be ≤17 and ≤16, respectively. So 15.5 is acceptable for both. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. So I need to think about this again. The apparent magnitude is what matters for the telescope. The telescope sees the star's light after any extinction. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5. So both telescopes can detect it because 15.5 ≤16 and ≤17.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star3's apparent magnitude after considering extinction is 15.5, which comes from an intrinsic magnitude of 13.64. But that's not relevant because the telescope only sees the observed m. So if the observed m is 15.5, that's the value used.

So Star3's observed m is 15.5, so both telescopes can detect it. So Star3 is a candidate.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, located at 10 pc. So the apparent mag without extinction would be M +5 log(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5. Then, extinction adds 3.1*0.4=1.24 mag. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed m is 16.74. Now, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so it can detect it. HIRES can go up to 16, so 16.74 is too faint. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So apparent mag without extinction is M +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5(log(0.5))=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approximately 15.0.

Now, any extinction? The question says Star5 has an E(B-V) of 0.3? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, Star5's description: "absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." No mention of E(B-V). So no extinction. So apparent mag is 15.0. Then both telescopes can detect it because 15 ≤16 and ≤17. So Star5 is detectable by both.

So let me recap:

Star1: apparent mag 15.5 (no extinction), detectable by both.

Star2: apparent mag 16.5, detectable by ESPRESSO (≤17), but not HIRES (needs ≤16).

Star3: apparent mag 15.5, detectable by both.

Star4: observed m=16.74, detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star5: apparent mag 15.0, detectable by both.

So which stars can be detected by both? Stars1,3,5.

Now, looking at the options:

Options are A to D. Let's check.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. But Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO. So A not correct.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both are detectable by both. So B is a possibility.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, so C incorrect.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 is detectable by both, but Star4 is only by ESPRESSO. So D incorrect.

So the correct answer should include Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check Star3 again.

Earlier, I thought that Star3's observed m is 15.5. But wait, no. Because the problem states that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, but the calculation of extinction is 3.1 × 0.6=1.86. Therefore, the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m0=15.5 -1.86=13.64. Wait, that can't be right because the star is at 15 pc. Let me compute the absolute magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and because of extinction, the observed m is higher. So to get the observed m, you have to add the extinction. So if without extinction, the apparent mag would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's the apparent mag without extinction. But the observed m is 15.5. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is what matters for the telescopes.

So yes, Star3 is detectable by both.

Star5: no extinction, so apparent m=15.0, so detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star3 and Star5. So option B says "Star3 and Star5", which is correct.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. A star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both telescopes.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 (since absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude at 10 pc).  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Observed V magnitude = 15.5.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO (15.5 ≤ 17) and HIRES (15.5 ≤ 16).  

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 16.5.  
   - HIRES can only observe stars up to 16, so this star is too faint for HIRES.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (16.5 ≤ 17) but not HIRES.  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5, E(B-V) = 0.6.  
   - Extinction in V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - Observed V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36.  
   - This star is fainter than both detection limits (17.36 > 17 and 17.36 > 16).  
   - **Not detectable by either telescope.**  

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4.  
   - Apparent V magnitude without extinction = 15.5 (since absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude at 10 pc).  
   - Extinction in V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (16.74 ≤ 17) but not HIRES (16.74 > 16).  

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude = \( M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Observed V magnitude = 15.0.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO (15.0 ≤ 17) and HIRES (15.0 ≤ 16).  

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1** and **Star5**.
