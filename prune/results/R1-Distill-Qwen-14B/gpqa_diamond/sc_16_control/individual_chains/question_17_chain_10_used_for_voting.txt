Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

The problem says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA. So the reaction must be something like Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

The K for the complex is given as 5e10, which is a very large number. That suggests the complex is very stable, right? So at this K value, the concentration of the complex will be much higher than the free ions.

The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's a 1:1 complex, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA. Wait no, wait. Actually, the complex is formed as Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

So when the complex dissociates, it gives back Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentration of Ca²+ would depend on how much the complex dissociates.

But wait, the K is the formation constant, Kf. Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So Kf = 5e10.

But in this case, the solution is already the complex. So I think the problem is asking, given that the complex is present, what is the concentration of free Ca²+ ions?

Wait, another thing: the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So let's assume that initially, the solution is just the complex. As time passes, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But in reality, the dissociation is minimal because K is large. Because Kf is large, the complex is stable, so dissociation is low. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So let's model this. Let's say the concentration of the complex is C = 0.02 M. Let x be the amount that dissociates per liter. So, CaEDTA²- dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x, but since x is very small (because K is large), we can approximate [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02.

[Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x.

So plugging into the Kf equation: Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know Kf is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

We can solve for x²: x² = 0.02 / 5e10

Calculating that: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait wait, wait: 5e10 is 5*10^10. So 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13. Taking square root gives x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

So sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute it numerically. Let's compute 4e-13.

The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.32e-7 M, which matches option C, which is 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaEDTA²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex is represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of calcium ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium:
- \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \)),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\),
- \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
