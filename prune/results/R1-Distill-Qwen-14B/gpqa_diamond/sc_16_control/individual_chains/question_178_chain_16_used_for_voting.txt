Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constants. Let's see. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I'll figure out the dimensions of each part of the term. I know that in 4-dimensional spacetime (which is standard for these kinds of theories), the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian should be 4, because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x has dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, let's break down each part. The fields: ψ is a spinor, so it's a Dirac field. The mass dimension of ψ is 3/2. Because in 4D, fermions have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄, which is ψ† γ^0, also has dimension 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is an antisymmetric tensor. But when it comes to mass dimensions, each γ matrix doesn't contribute to the dimension because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} doesn't add any mass dimension beyond the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Wait, no, wait. The sigma is a product of gamma matrices, but as for fields, σ_{mu nu} is a product of two gamma matrices multiplied by the field strength tensor. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, σ_{mu nu} is a product of two gamma matrices, right? Because it's [γ_mu, γ_nu], so it's a combination of products. But in terms of field dimensions, sigma_mu_nu is part of the term involving the field strength, but I think in this case, σ_{mu nu} is just a product of gamma matrices and doesn't carry any mass dimension beyond the fields it's made from. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each part.

So the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each of the fields is ψ̄ and ψ, which are spinors, and F^{mu nu}, which is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like electromagnetism or Yang-Mills. Let me recall: the field strength F^{mu nu} is the derivative of A, so it has the same mass dimension as the field A_mu multiplied by (mass)^1, because derivatives are mass dimension 1.

Wait, A_mu is a vector field, so its mass dimension is 1. Because in the Maxwell term, F_{mu nu}^2, the F has dimension 2 since each derivative contributes 1, so F is dimension 2. Because A_mu is dimension 1, F which is ∂A is dimension 2.

Wait, another approach. The general rule is that in 4D, for a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension. So I can calculate the dimension of each term and solve for κ.

Let me write down the dimensions:

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ and ψ each contribute 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} is a product of two gamma matrices, but since gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. Because the gamma matrices don't contribute any mass dimension, only the fields do. So σ_{mu nu} doesn't add any mass dimension; it's just a tensor made from the gamma matrices, which are part of the spinor representation.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, which is a derivative of A. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, because each derivative brings in a mass dimension of 1, and A has dimension 1, so ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ would be 1 + 1 =2? Wait, no. Wait, the field strength F^{mu nu} is ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu, right? So each term is ∂ (mass^1) acting on A (which is mass^1?), wait no, A has dimension 1? Wait, no, in 4D, the gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. So each derivative adds 1, so F_{mu nu} would have dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (3/2), σ_{mu nu} (0), ψ (3/2), and F^{mu nu} (2). So the total dimension is 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 + [κ]. Because the term must have dimension 4 (since Lagrangian terms are dim 4).

Wait, no. Wait, the term itself is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F must have dimension 4.

So let's compute the dimension of the product ψ̄ σ F.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. Then, the product is 5 in mass dimension, and the term is κ multiplied by that. So overall:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + 5 = 4.

Wait, no, wait. Because the term is κ multiplied by the product, which is ψ̄ σ ψ F. The product of ψ̄ and ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then multiplied by F (dimension 2) gives 3 +2=5. So the term is κ * (5). So the dimension of the term is [κ] +5 =4. So [κ]=4-5= -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, that's option A or C, because in the options, the first part is [κ] of -1. So options A and C have that. Now, the second question is whether the theory is renormalizable.

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant's mass dimension. If the mass dimension is positive, the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative, the theory is not renormalizable (because it's a higher-dimensional operator). 

Wait, but wait, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling tells us about renormalizability. In four dimensions, a coupling constant with positive mass dimension is allowed in a renormalizable theory. Because the Lagrangian terms must have dimension 4. So if [κ] is negative, the term is nonrenormalizable, because you can't have a counterterm for it at the same dimension.

Wait, wait. The rule is that for a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≥ 0. So if [κ] is -1, which is negative, the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In 4-dimensional spacetime, each term in the Lagrangian must have a total mass dimension of 4, as the action is dimensionless and the spacetime integral contributes a factor of $d^4x$ (dimension 4). The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:

\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4.
\]

- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$, and so does its adjoint $\bar{\psi}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, which is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has a mass dimension of $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The object $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

Substituting these values:

\[
[\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable, as higher-dimensional operators (with negative mass dimension) cannot be included in a renormalizable theory.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
