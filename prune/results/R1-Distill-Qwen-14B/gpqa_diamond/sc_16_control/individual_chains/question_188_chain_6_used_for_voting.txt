Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances, but let's think through it. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal with specific parameters, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance d is related to the crystal lattice parameters. For a general cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's for a cubic crystal. But here, it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal or maybe a more general system.

Wait, rhombohedral. Oh right, rhombohedral systems have all edges equal (like a cube) but the angles can be different. Oh wait no, wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length a, but the angles between the edges (alpha, beta, gamma) are all equal. So this structure is a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. But in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees each. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, not a cube.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is a bit more complicated than the cubic case. I think the general formula involves the reciprocal of the plane indices and the metric tensor, but maybe I can find a simplified version for this specific case.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) * (1/(... )) Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach is to consider the Miller indices (hkl) and use the formula involving the lattice parameters and the angles between the axes.

I recall that the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, but wait, no, I think it's a bit different because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all the same, 30 degrees in this case.

Wait, maybe the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )

But since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, that simplifies things.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1 +1 +1) - 2*(1*1 cos 30) -2*(1*1 cos 30) -2*(1*1 cos 30) )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, the numerator is a, which is given as 10 Angstrom.

The denominator inside the sqrt is:

3 (sum of h², k², l²) minus 2 times (hk + hl + kl) multiplied by cos(alpha), where alpha is 30 degrees.

Wait, because each cosine term is for the angle between a pair of axes. Since all angles are 30 degrees, each of the three cosine terms is cos30.

So, compute the denominator:

3 - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30°)

Wait, no: each term is 2*(hk cos alpha), but in this case, each of the three terms is 2*(1*1 * cos30), so the sum of the three terms is 6 * cos30.

Wait, wait—let me re-calculate:

Wait, the denominator is:

(h² +k² + l²) = 1 +1 +1 =3

Then, the other part is 2*(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma )

Since all alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees, this becomes 2*( (1*1)cos30 + (1*1)cos30 + (1*1)cos30 )

Which is 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 * cos30.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( 3 - 6*cos30 )

Compute cos30: cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So denominator: sqrt( 3 -5.196 ) = sqrt( -2.196 ). Wait, that's impossible. The denominator inside the square root is negative, which would mean d is imaginary, which can't be right. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, no, because if all angles are 30 degrees, and the formula is as I had before, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2)/(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Another approach: maybe for a rhombohedral lattice, the volume of the unit cell can be found, and then the interplanar distance can be calculated using the volume and the plane's indices.

Wait, I think I should refer back to the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

I found in some resources that for a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter a and angles alpha, the interplanar distance for (h k l) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but no, wait—that would be if all angles are alpha. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between axes are all equal. So that might make the formula simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Because in rhombohedral systems, all angles are the same. So for our case, alpha =30 degrees.

So, for (111), substituting h=k=l=1:

d = a / sqrt( 1 +1 +1 - 2 [1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30] )

Which is:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Compute 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Oh, wait, the denominator becomes sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That's impossible. So I must have the formula wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l^2 + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Wait, that would be:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Which is 3 + 6*(0.866) ≈3 + 5.196 =8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstrom. But none of the options are close to that. Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2( hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so this becomes:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 6 cos α )

But as before, with alpha =30°, which leads to 3 -6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈3-5.196= -2.196. Negative inside sqrt.

This can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Maybe I should consider using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

a^2 [  1      cos α     cos α
        cos α    1       cos α
        cos α  cos α     1 ]

So the reciprocal of the metric tensor would give the (hkl) plane's coefficients.

The interplanar distance is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = (1/a^2)( h² + k² + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that makes sense because for a cubic system, cos α is zero (since angles are 90), so it reduces to d = a/sqrt(h²+k²+l²), which is correct.

So for our case, a=10 Angstrom, alpha=30 degrees, h=k=l=1.

So compute:

d^2 = (1/10^2) * (1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)* cos30 )

Which simplifies to:

d^2 = (1/100) * [3 + 2*(3)* (sqrt(3)/2) ]

Compute the inside:

3 + 3*(sqrt(3)).

Because 2*(3)=6, but sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, so 6*0.866=5.196.

Wait, let me compute again:

Wait, 2*(3) * cos30 = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So the numerator inside is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d^2 = 8.196 / 100 =0.08196.

Thus, d= sqrt(0.08196) ≈0.2863 Angstrom? That can't be right either because the options are in the 9-10 range. Oh wait, wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, so plugging in the numbers:

h=1, k=1, l=1, a=10, cos30= sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.866 )

= sqrt(3 + 5.196 )

= sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstrom. But none of the options match this. The options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. Hmm, so something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again. Another approach: The interplanar distance for a general rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ]

Wait, but in this case, gamma, beta, alpha are all 30 degrees. So, the formula becomes:

d^2 = a^2 / [3 + 6 cos30 ]

Wait, 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3+5.196=8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196) =10 / 2.863≈3.492 Angstrom. Again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So maybe I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

In our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so:

d =10 / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Which is 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative again. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Let me think about this again. Maybe I should consider the volume of the unit cell and use the formula involving the volume and the plane's indices.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), but I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal of the metric tensor is needed. The metric tensor G for the rhombohedral system is:

G = a² [ 1      cos α     cos α
          cos α    1       cos α
          cos α  cos α     1 ]

The reciprocal tensor G^{-1} will have elements that help in computing the interplanar distances. The formula for interplanar distance is 1 / sqrt( h² G11 + k² G22 + l² G33 + 2hk G12 + 2hl G13 + 2kl G23 )

Wait, more accurately, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h G11 + k G12 + l G13)^2 + (h G21 + k G22 + l G23)^2 + (h G31 + k G32 + l G33)^2 )

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor's (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) elements, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can also be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. If all angles are 30 degrees, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

But as before, that's 3 -5.196 = -2.196, which is negative. So that can't be. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Which would give:

d =10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) 

Which is 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.492 Å.

But again, this is not matching the options. So maybe the question is referring to a different crystal system.

Wait, perhaps this is a face-centered cubic or body-centered cubic structure, but the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, another thought. Could the crystal be a special case where the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30? Because 30 degrees seems a bit unusual for rhombohedral. Wait, no, the question says 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the formula. Let's recalculate the denominator.

Wait, for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So the denominator inside the square root in the formula I'm considering is:

h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α )

Which is 3 + 2*(3)*cos30 =3 +6*(√3/2) =3+3√3.

So sqrt(3 +3√3) ≈ sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=~2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.492 Å.

Hmm. The options are way larger than that. So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the metric tensor approach is the way to go. The metric tensor G is given by:

G = a² [ 1       cos α     cos α
          cos α     1      cos α
          cos α   cos α      1 ]

For a rhombohedral system. So for our case, a=10, and α=30 degrees.

The reciprocal tensor G^{-1} is needed to compute the interplanar distance.

The formula for interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Wait, but that's the same as before. So perhaps I'm going in circles.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 α - cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the volume using the scalar triple product. For a rhombohedral unit cell, the volume is given by:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

With α=30 degrees, cos alpha=√3/2≈0.866.

So V=10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) +2*(√3/2)^3 )

Wait, cos^2 30= (0.866)^2≈0.75.

(√3/2)^3= (3√3)/8≈0.6495.

So 1 - 3*(0.75) =1 -2.25= -1.25.

Plus 2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So total inside sqrt: -1.25 +1.299≈0.049.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.049) ≈1000 * 0.221≈221.3 Å^3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps me find d_{111}.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ) )

Wait, but I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is given by:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) ) * (something involving the angles).

Wait, perhaps for a non-cubic system, the formula is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) )

In our case, since all angles are 30 degrees, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 ) =10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10 /2.863≈3.492 Å.

Again, same answer. Doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a hexagonal crystal, not rhombohedral. Because hexagonal systems have a (111) plane with a different formula. Let me think about that.

In a hexagonal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - hk ) )

Wait, perhaps for the (111) plane. So:

d= a / sqrt(1+1+1 -1*1 )= a / sqrt(2)≈10/1.414≈7.071 Å. But that's not matching the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Miller indices are different. Wait, the question is about (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure, but maybe the formula for d is different.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula.

I found another source that says for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Which brings me back to the same calculation, resulting in d≈3.492 Å, which is much smaller than the options given.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I made a mistake in using 'a' as 10 Angstrom.

Wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell. So that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for something else, like the (100) plane, but the question is about (111). Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be adjusted for the unit cell type.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the interatomic distance with the lattice parameter. Oh wait, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in this case because it's a rhombohedral structure with a single atom per lattice point. Or is that the case?

Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1, but in a face-centered cubic structure, it's a√2/2. So the question here says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the lattice parameter is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong 'a'. Let me think. For a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance is a. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so a is 10.

But in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the interatomic distance is a certain function of 'a' and the angles.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance d_0 (distance between nearest atoms) is given by a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, for a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. For a rhombohedral structure with angles alpha, the nearest neighbor distance would depend on the arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedron, so the distance between nearest neighbors is a√( ... ).

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given by a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α ), where alpha is the angle between the lattice vectors. So for alpha=30 degrees, cos30=√3/2≈0.866.

So the distance would be a * sqrt(1 + 2*(0.866) ) = a * sqrt(1 +1.732)=a * sqrt(2.732)≈a*1.652.

Given that the interatomic distance is 10, we have 10 = a *1.652 → a=10/1.652≈6.054 Angstrom.

Wait, this would change the calculation because 'a' was taken as 10, but perhaps the correct 'a' is 6.054.

So then, let's recalculate the interplanar distance with a=6.054.

Using the same formula as before, d= a / sqrt(3 +6 * cos30 )

So 3 +6*(√3/2)=3 +3√3≈8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=6.054 /2.863 ≈2.114 Angstrom. Still way too small.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter, a=10. So we go back to the earlier calculation, but that gives a d of 3.492, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is really about a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which is a special case of a cubic structure with a (111) plane. But the question says it's rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and I should instead use another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is given by:

g = (h a + k b cos gamma + l c cos beta ) i +

( k a cos alpha + h b + l c cos alpha ) j +

( l a cos alpha + h c cos alpha + k b ) k.

But for a rhombohedral system, a =b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So, for (111), g becomes:

g = [1*a + 1*a cos30 + 1*a cos30 ] i +

[1*a cos30 +1*a +1*a cos30 ] j +

[1*a cos30 +1*a cos30 +1*a ] k.

Which simplifies to:

g = a [1 + cos30 + cos30 ] i +

a [ cos30 +1 + cos30 ] j +

a [ cos30 + cos30 +1 ] k.

Since cos30=√3/2≈0.866, each component becomes a*(1 + 2*(0.866)) =a*(1 +1.732)=a*2.732.

So the magnitude of g is sqrt( (2.732a)^2 + (2.732a)^2 + (2.732a)^2 )

= sqrt(3*(2.732a)^2 )=2.732a * sqrt(3).

But d is 1/|g|, so:

d = 1/(2.732a * sqrt(3)) ) → since a=10,

d= 1/(2.732 *10 *1.732 )

Compute denominator: 2.732 *10=27.32; 27.32 *1.732≈47.25.

So d ≈1/47.25≈0.02117 Angstrom. That's way too small. So this can't be right.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should check for any miscalculations or alternative approaches.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula specific to rhombohedral crystals. From what I remember, the interplanar distance for (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk +hl +kl) cos α )

So with a=10, alpha=30, and h=k=l=1.

So, compute denominator:

3 + 6*(cos30) =3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.492 Å. But the options are much larger.

Hmm, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a different type of crystal system. Wait, maybe the question is about a hexagonal close-packed structure, which has a different formula.

Wait, in a hexagonal system, the interplanar distance for (111) is d= a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - hk )).

So for h=k=l=1:

d= a / sqrt(3 -1 )= a/sqrt(2)=10/1.414≈7.07 Å. Still not matching any options.

Wait, the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So perhaps the formula should give d around 9.

Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which in our case, gives 10/sqrt(3+6*0.866)=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.492 Å. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles in a different way. What if it's cos(60 degrees) instead of 30? Let's see.

If alpha were 60 degrees, then cos60=0.5.

So denominator:3 + 6*(0.5)=3+3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 Å. Still not matching.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the formula.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal lattice. Let me try that.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) (1, cos α, cos α )

b2 = (1/a) (cos α, 1, cos alpha )

b3 = (1/a) (cos alpha, cos alpha, 1 )

The magnitude of the reciprocal vector for (111) is:

|b111| = sqrt( (1/a)^2 [ (1)^2 + (cos alpha)^2 + (cos alpha)^2 + 2*(1*cos alpha +1*cos alpha + cos alpha * cos alpha) ] )

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the (hkl) plane's reciprocal vector is:

g = h b1 +k b2 +l b3.

The magnitude of g is:

|g|= sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1/a^2) + 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos alpha + kl cos alpha) (1/a^2) )

So:

|g|= (1/a) sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 + 2(hk +hl +kl) cos alpha )

Thus, the interplanar distance d is 1/|g|.

So,

d= a / sqrt( h² +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk +hl +kl) cos alpha )

Which brings me back to the same formula as before, giving d≈3.492 Å.

But none of the options are close. So maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try that.

If alpha=60, cos60=0.5.

Denominator for (111):3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 Å. Still not matching.

Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Another possibility is that the rhombohedral system uses a different approach, such as considering the basis vectors with angles alpha, but perhaps using a different method to calculate d.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the unit cell as a parallelepiped and use the general formula for interplanar distance.

The general formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h a1 · a1 +k a1 · a2 +l a1 · a3 )^2 + ... )

But that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, let's test with alpha=60, where cos60=0.5.

Then, 3 - (1+1+1) =3-3=0. Which can't be correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, let's compute that with alpha=30.

So denominator:3 - 2*(3)*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. Negative again.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that none of the options fit the calculation, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is the one for a cubic system, but with a different a. Because the options are much larger than what I'm getting. Let me try that.

If I treat it as a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(3) =10/1.732≈5.774 Å. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question treats the angles as 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try that.

Using alpha=60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

So denominator:3 +6*(0.5)=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449. So d=10/2.449≈4.082 Å. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal of the formula. Maybe the formula is (h² +k² +l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ), but then d would be 10/sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. Not possible.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the formula is different for rhombohedral systems, and perhaps I'm using the wrong one.

Wait, another source I found says that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which is what I've been using. So with alpha=30, a=10, we get d≈3.492 Å. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the (100) plane instead of (111). Let me try that.

For (100), h=1, k=0, l=0.

So denominator:1 +0 +0 +2*(0 +0 +0)=1.

d=10/sqrt(1)=10 Å. The options don't have 10, but option D is 10.05. Close, but not exact.

Wait, but the problem states (111) plane. So that must not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer is around 3.5, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) 9.08

B) 8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

All are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But with alpha=30 degrees.

Wait, for (111), that would be 3 - 6 *0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative. Can't take square root.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 120 degrees. Let me try that.

cos(120)= -0.5.

So denominator:3 +6*(-0.5)=3-3=0. So d is infinite, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives 10/sqrt(8.196)=3.492 Å. But perhaps the reciprocal is taken, making d= sqrt(8.196)/10=2.863/10=0.286. No, that's even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives 3.492 Å. But maybe I should multiply by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the interplanar distance formula, but I don't see how that would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the rhombohedral angles. Wait, some sources define the rhombohedral angles as gamma=60 degrees, but I'm not sure.

Let me try alpha=60 degrees.

So cos60=0.5.

Denominator:3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for (111) would be 3 -6*(0.5)=3-3=0. Impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the interatomic distance in terms of 'a' and the angles, then solve for 'a'.

Interatomic distance in a rhombohedral system is the distance between nearest neighbors. In a simple rhombohedral structure, each atom is at a vertex of the rhombohedron, so the nearest neighbor distance is a√(1 + 2 cos alpha ).

So, given that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom:

10 = a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos30 )

So, a=10 / sqrt(1 + 2*(√3/2) )

=10 / sqrt(1 +√3 )

√3≈1.732, so denominator≈sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

a=10/1.652≈6.054 Angstrom.

Now, using this 'a' in the interplanar distance formula.

So for (111):

d= a / sqrt( 3 +6 * cos30 )

=6.054 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

=6.054/ sqrt(8.196)=6.054/2.863≈2.114 Å.

Still not matching options. So perhaps the interatomic distance is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√( (1 + 2 cos alpha )/ something ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha ), which for alpha=30 degrees is sqrt(1+√3)≈1.652.

So, if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10/1.652≈6.054.

Then, the interplanar distance formula gives d≈2.114 Å, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom, which is about 3 times larger than 'a' (which is 6.054). So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct formula gives d≈3a.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system is a/sqrt(3). So, when a is about 9.54, this gives d≈5.5, but that doesn't match the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is a. So, if a is 9.54, then d is 9.54. But that's option C.

But earlier calculations with a=10 gave d≈3.492 Å.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl +kl) cos alpha )

Wait, but that would make d = 10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈10 *2.863=28.63 Å, which is way too big.

No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl +kl) cos alpha ) )

Which for alpha=30, gives:

d=10/sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the structure factor approach, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the denominator. Let me compute 1/sqrt(8.196)=0.349. So if a=10, d=3.49.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance for a different plane. For example, (222), but the question is about (111).

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a face-centered cubic system, which is a special case of rhombohedral with alpha=60 degrees.

Wait, in FCC, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(3)), and a is the cubic lattice parameter. But the question is about rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95. Let me compute what a would be.

If d=8.95, then from the formula:

d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )

So,

sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )= a / d.

a = d * sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )

=8.95 * sqrt(8.196)=8.95 *2.863≈25.63 Angstrom.

Then, the interatomic distance would be a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos30 )=25.63 * sqrt(1+1.732)=25.63 * sqrt(2.732)=25.63 *1.652≈42.35 Å, which is way larger than the given 10 Å. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I should stop and conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for d is a divided by the square root of the sum of h^2, k^2, l^2 plus 2 times the sum of hk, hl, kl multiplied by (1 - cos alpha).

Wait, let's try that.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * (1 - cos30) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(1-0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.134) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +0.804)=10 / sqrt(3.804)=10/1.950≈5.129 Å. Still not matching.

Hmm. I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none give an answer matching the options. I must have made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111):

d=10/sqrt(3-6)=10/sqrt(-3). Impossible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2*alpha, but I don't think so.

After trying all these approaches, I think I'm missing something fundamental. Maybe I should look for another way to compute it.

Wait, perhaps using the unit cell dimensions and the plane's intercepts. The (111) plane intercepts at a, a, a along the axes.

The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (1/(h_1^2) + 1/(h_2^2) + 1/(h_3^2) ) )

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the distance between two parallel planes.

Wait, the general formula for the distance between two adjacent planes in a crystal is:

d = |c| / sqrt( (l^2 + m^2 +n^2) + 2(lm cos gamma + ln cos beta + mn cos alpha) )

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and choose the closest option based on the formula I'm using, but I'm not confident.

Since all my calculations give d≈3.492 Å, but the options are higher, perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe the lattice parameter 'a' is not 10, but the interatomic distance is 10.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 'a' in terms of the interatomic distance. Let's say the interatomic distance is 'd0'.

In a simple cubic system, d0 =a. So a=d0=10.

In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is a*sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha ). So,

d0 = a*sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha )

So,

a = d0 / sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha )

With alpha=30,

a =10 / sqrt(1 + 2*(√3/2) ) =10 / sqrt(1 +√3 )

Which is approximately 10 /1.931 ≈5.176 Angstrom.

Now, using this 'a' in the interplanar distance formula.

d = a/sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2 ) ) =5.176 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=5.176/2.863≈1.809 Å. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I've tried all possible approaches, but I can't get the answer to match the options. Perhaps the correct formula is different, but I'm not recalling it correctly. 

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the options are around 9 Angstrom, and my calculation with a=10 gives d≈3.49, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95, but I'm not sure how.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \alpha + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

### Key Parameters:
- Lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Plane indices \( h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 \)
- Angle \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \alpha + kl \cos \alpha) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

2. Compute \( d \):
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.492 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- The calculated \( d \approx 3.492 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around \( 9 \, \text{Å} \).
- The discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or a misinterpretation of the problem. However, based on the given options and the calculations, the closest plausible answer is **B) 8.95 Å**, though the reasoning for this result is unclear.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, and assuming the question intends for one of the provided answers to be correct, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
