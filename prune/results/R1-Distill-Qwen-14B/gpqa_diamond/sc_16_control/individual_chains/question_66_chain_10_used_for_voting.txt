Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that describes the interactions of the Standard Model particles at high energies, beyond the electroweak scale. It adds higher-dimensional operators to account for new physics effects.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, right? That includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it includes momentum conservation as well. So if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if one is a subset of another...

CP symmetry is Charge conjugation followed by Parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry derived from the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. So all theories must respect CPT symmetry, right?

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory. Do the operators in SMEFT have to respect all these symmetries? I think the operators are constructed in a way that respects the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT should preserve those. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP symmetry. For example, the CKM matrix in the SM leads to CP violation.

So operators in SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the SM. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry and CPT must be respected. What about Poincare? Well, Poincare includes translations, so momentum conservation. But if an operator doesn't have the right Lorentz structure, or doesn't have the correct momentum dependence, it might not respect Poincare. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, the operators are built into local field theory, so they should respect Poincare symmetry as a whole. Because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant theory, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So each operator is a Lorentz-invariant operator, which implies that Lorentz symmetry is respected.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry. So if the operator is a Lorentz scalar and the theory is built in a way that respects momentum conservation, then Poincare symmetry is also respected. Or does each individual operator not necessarily have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which in QFT are handled by momentum conservation in the interactions. So each operator would need to have the correct momentum dependence to conserve it. But in effective theory, the operators are local, so I think they do respect Poincare.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So let me think again. Which symmetries are automatically respected because of the way SMEFT is constructed?

So SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Therefore, all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely in the answer.

CPT symmetry: Since the SM respects CPT, and SMEFT is an effective theory built on top, the operators should respect CPT. So any operator in SMEFT must be invariant under CPT.

What about CP symmetry? The SM doesn't have CP symmetry, so SMEFT doesn't need to enforce it. So operators can violate CP.

Poincare symmetry: Since the theory is Lorentz-invariant and includes translations, but each operator is a local term. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. But operators in the SMEFT are written as local terms, which should respect momentum conservation. So each operator would have terms that are compatible with Poincare symmetry. So all operators would respect Poincare symmetry as well.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how SMEFT is built. The operators are operators in the Lagrangian, so each term must be a scalar under Lorentz. So each operator is a scalar, hence Lorentz-invariant. Also, the theory as a whole (the Lagrangian) must be invariant under Poincare, so each term in the Lagrangian must respect that. Because terms in the Lagrangian are local, and each operator is a scalar, they should respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry are required.

But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So the operators must be such that each one is invariant under these symmetries. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, it's not part of SMEFT. Same for Poincare.

Wait, but wait, Poincare is more than just Lorentz. It includes translation symmetry, which is tied to momentum conservation. So if an operator were to have a term that isn't translation invariant, like having a derivative in a way that breaks momentum conservation, that would be a problem. But in SMEFT, each operator is a local term, so they are translation invariant.

So all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. But the options given are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

The options for the answer are combinations. The question is, which of these must all operators respect. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but looking at the possible options, option A) is 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare. Option C is 1,2,4. So which is correct?

Wait, but wait. Are all operators in SMEFT required to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is Poincare symmetry something that the entire theory respects, but individual terms don't have to, as long as the sum does? Hmm. Because the whole Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare, but each term (operator) must be a scalar, so perhaps each operator must be Lorentz invariant and have the correct momentum structure, but perhaps it's the sum that has to respect momentum conservation.

Wait, no. Each term in the Lagrangian is a scalar, and each term must have the correct transformation properties. For example, each term is a Lorentz scalar and has the correct engineering dimension. But the translation invariance (Poincare) is about the Lagrangian density being a scalar under spacetime translations, which is handled by the fact that the Lagrangian is a local function. So each operator in the Lagrangian is a local scalar, so each operator respects Lorentz and Poincare.

Thus, all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So the correct options would include 1 and 2.

But the options are 1,2; 3,4; 1,2,4; 1,3,4.

So, if the answer includes 1,2,4 (option C), but wait, do the operators have to respect CPT symmetry?

CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. The SM respects CPT, right? So SMEFT, as an effective theory, must respect CPT. Therefore, any operator in the SMEFT must be invariant under CPT transformations.

Wait, but wait. The operators in SMEFT are not necessarily required to be individually CPT symmetric, but the entire theory must be symmetric, right? Or must each operator respect CPT?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because the operators are part of a larger theory that respects CPT. But each operator must be a scalar, but for CPT, perhaps each operator must transform in a way that the overall Lagrangian is CPT invariant.

Wait, but CPT symmetry is more of a global symmetry, and for a theory to have CPT symmetry, it must hold that the theory is invariant under the combined transformation. But for individual operators, their structure must be such that when you apply C, then P, then T, the operator remains the same or perhaps changes in a way that doesn't break the symmetry.

Wait, actually, for a theory to have CPT symmetry, the operator must transform into its Hermitian conjugate under CPT. Wait, no, I think for a theory to be CPT symmetric, the Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. So the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under CPT. But does that mean each operator must be invariant under CPT, or that the combination is?

Hmm. I think each operator must transform in a way that when you apply the CPT transformation, the operator's form is preserved. Because, for example, the operator could be odd under CPT, but then another operator would have to be even to balance it out, but that's not possible because operators are part of the Lagrangian which is a sum of terms. So perhaps each operator must be CPT even.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, some terms are CPT even and others are CPT odd. For example, the Higgs potential is CPT even, but terms with fermions might have CPT odd parts. Wait, no, the Higgs is a scalar, so it's CPT even. Fermion terms are CPT odd because they're like ψ†γ...ψ, which under CPT would change. So if the theory includes terms that change sign under CPT, but the overall theory is CPT symmetric, that would require other terms to compensate. But in the Standard Model, the theory as a whole is CPT symmetric. So perhaps the individual terms can be CPT even or odd, but the overall Lagrangian must be invariant.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, each operator is a higher-dimensional term. Suppose an operator is CPT odd. Then the entire Lagrangian would change sign under CPT unless there's another term to cancel it. But the effective theory must respect CPT, so perhaps all the operators must be CPT even. Because otherwise, the addition of an odd operator would break the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the CPT symmetry of the operators is enforced by the requirement that their coefficients are real, leading to CPT invariance.

Wait, but in SMEFT, each operator is multiplied by a coefficient (like c_i), and for the theory to be CPT-invariant, the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions. For example, if an operator O is CPT-odd, then its coefficient must be zero or have a specific relation with other coefficients. But in the general SMEFT, not all operators are CPT even. So perhaps the operators can have CPT even or odd, but for the theory to be CPT-invariant, certain conditions must hold between the coefficients.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operator can violate CPT, then it's not a symmetry that must be respected. But wait, the entire theory must respect CPT symmetry. So perhaps each operator must individually respect CPT symmetry.

Hmm, if an operator doesn't respect CPT, then the entire Lagrangian might not be CPT-invariant unless the coefficients are constrained. But in SMEFT, the operators are added with arbitrary coefficients, so unless the operators are CPT-even, their presence would require constraints on the coefficients to maintain CPT symmetry.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operator can violate CPT, then CPT isn't a symmetry that all operators must individually respect.

Wait, perhaps for the theory to respect CPT symmetry, each operator must be a CPT scalar. Because otherwise, the combination of operators could lead to a non-invariant theory unless their coefficients are constrained. But if the operators are required to be CPT scalars, then the theory is automatically CPT-invariant.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe SMEFT doesn't require individual operators to respect CPT, but the entire Lagrangian must. So the operators can have any CPT properties, as long as the sum is invariant under CPT. But that would require relations between the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps each operator in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The SM respects CPT symmetry. So the effective theory must respect CPT too. Therefore, any operator added in SMEFT must be such that when you apply CPT, it transforms into another operator that's already present in the theory, possibly with a coefficient that ensures the overall Lagrangian is invariant.

Wait, but that would require the operators to be arranged in CPT multiplets. So perhaps each operator must come in a way that respects CPT symmetry, but that doesn't necessarily mean each operator individually is CPT-invariant. They can transform into other operators, but the entire set must form a CPT-symmetric combination.

But the question is about operators respecting the symmetry. So if an operator transforms into another operator, the symmetry is respected because the operator is part of a multiplet.

Hmm, but that's a bit more involved. I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, to ensure the theory is CPT-symmetric, each operator must be CPT-even because otherwise, adding an odd operator would require another odd operator with a particular coefficient to maintain invariance.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, there are terms that are CPT-odd, like the Yukawa terms. For example, a term like Hψ†ψ is CPT-odd because H is a scalar (CPT-even), ψ† is the conjugate of ψ, and under CPT, ψ → T(P C ψ), so ψ† → ψ^T C P T ψ†? Hmm, perhaps my understanding is a bit off, but I think Yukawa terms are CPT-odd.

If the Standard Model includes CPT-odd operators, then SMEFT can include them as well. So the operators in SMEFT don't have to be individually CPT-even. Therefore, CPT symmetry is not necessarily required to be respected by each operator, but the sum of the operators in the Lagrangian must respect CPT.

But the question is about what each operator must respect. So perhaps each operator doesn't have to individually respect CPT, but the entire theory must. So CPT symmetry is not a requirement for each operator, but for the entire Lagrangian.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators". So if the operator doesn't respect a symmetry, like CPT, then the entire theory might not. So perhaps each operator must be CPT-invariant.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to know that in SMEFT, the operators are constructed such that they are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include Lorentz, CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So for each operator, the symmetry applies. So which symmetries are required?

In SMEFT, operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since the operators are part of a local field theory, they must respect translation invariance as well. So Poincare (2) is also a must.

CPT symmetry (4) must be respected by the operators because the theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant. So each operator must be a CPT scalar.

CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, so SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect CP.

So the symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options would be 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4.

But earlier I thought that Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if operators respect Lorentz and translation (Poincare), then yes. So the correct answer would include Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

But wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied if the operators are Lorentz scalars and part of a local theory? Because a local theory would respect translations, as each term in the Lagrangian is a local function, so momentum is conserved.

So yes, the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So the answer is option C.

But wait, another thought. Do all operators in SMEFT have to be Poincare-invariant? Because Poincare includes translations, which are about the invariance under shifting coordinates. So each operator must be a scalar under translations; which is true because the operators are local. So yes, they must respect Poincare.

So the required symmetries are 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory constructed to describe the interactions of Standard Model (SM) particles at high energies. Operators in SMEFT are higher-dimensional terms added to the SM Lagrangian, and they must respect the symmetries of the SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**:  
   SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This ensures that the theory respects the principles of special relativity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected by all operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**:  
   Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local field theory, it inherently respects translation symmetry, and all operators are constructed as local terms. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**:  
   The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is built to extend the SM, it does not require operators to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a necessary symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**:  
   CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, derived from the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must also respect it. This implies that all operators in SMEFT must be CPT scalars.

### Conclusion:  
All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as the SM itself does not enforce it. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
