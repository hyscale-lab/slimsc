Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I should outline what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When we titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. The pH at different points will depend on how much of the acid has been neutralized by the base.

Wait, but before that, I should calculate the dilution of the acetic acid. Because initially, it's 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, and then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. Dilution factor is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M? Let me confirm. Molarity after dilution is (M1 * V1) / (V1 + V2). So M1 is 0.05, V1 is 20, V2 is 20. So (0.05 *20)/(40) = 1/4 = 0.025 M. Yes, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution would be volume in liters times molarity. 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. The pH at equivalence depends on the salt formed. Since the salt is CH3COO^- (acetate) in water, it will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

But wait, the question isn't just about the equivalence point. It's also asking about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's think about each part.

First, the equivalence point. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, the moles of NaOH at equivalence will be the same, 0.001 moles. But wait, the volume of NaOH at equivalence can be calculated. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So when we reach equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution. So the total solution volume is 50 cm³, 0.05 L.

The acetate ion in solution (from CH3COOH and NaOH reaction) will hydrolyze as follows: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but to find pH at equivalence, we can calculate the concentration of acetate. Moles of acetate are 0.001, and the volume is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.

The acetate ion hydrolysis equation:
CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-
Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0
Change: -x, +x, +x
Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since Kb is small.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10. Solving for x: x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. Then pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 9.02. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that more accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9, which is 5.405e-10. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should account for the exact calculation. Let me see. Maybe the approximation isn't valid. Let's compute Kb without approximation.

The equation Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let me denote x as [OH^-]. Then,

x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can ignore x in the denominator. So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02. But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options: looking at them, the highest pH in the options is 8.52 (option A), and others are lower. Hmm. Maybe I did a miscalculation.

Wait a second. Let me think again. What's the reaction at equivalence? We have CH3COO^- in solution. So the pH depends on the hydrolysis of acetate ions. But wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for weak bases.

The formula for pH in such cases is pH = (pKb - log C)/2, where C is the concentration. Alternatively, since Kb is very small, the pH can be approximated.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10. pKb is log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267. Then, pH = 14 - pOH. Wait, no, let me think. For a weak base, the pH can be found using the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C)

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, as before. So pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution may have a different volume or miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of acetic acid after dilution. Let me check again: original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume 40 cm³. So diluted concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³. So total solution volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm³=0.05 L. So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

So why is the pH not matching any option? Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the dissociation of water, but that's negligible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is at 25% titration, not the equivalence point. Oh no, wait, the question says pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I need to calculate both.

Let me think again. Perhaps I should approach each part step by step.

First, the 25% titration point. 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So initial moles in solution (after dilution): 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized, so:

Moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

So this is a buffer solution. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 2x10^-5; pKa is around 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is closer to 2, so maybe 4.74 or so). Let me compute more accurately.

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. So that's a possible candidate.

Wait, but let me confirm the volumes. Because when we add NaOH, the volume changes. But for a buffer solution, the concentrations are moles over total volume.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Adding 10% of the volume needed for equivalence would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³). So total solution volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

So the ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.3333, which is 1/3. So the same as before. So the pH calculation holds.

So pH at 25% is about 4.26.

Now, equivalence point. As I calculated earlier, the pH should be about 9.02. However, none of the options have such a high pH. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the equivalence point again. At equivalence, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of CH3COO^- in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So the Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base. The formula is pH = (pKb - log C)/2.

pKb is log(1/(Kb)). Wait, no, pKb is -log(Kb). So pKb = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267.

So the pH is (9.267 - log(0.02)) / 2.

Wait, log(0.02) is log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) ≈0.3010 -2= -1.699.

So pH = (9.267 - (-1.699)) / 2 = (10.966)/2 ≈5.483.

Wait, that's about 5.48. But that's not matching any of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach is to calculate [OH^-] directly.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M, and [CH3COOH] is negligible, but perhaps it's better to set up the equation.

Let me consider the hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. The change is -x, +x, +x. So,

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Wait, but the earlier approach using pH = (pKb - log C)/2 gave me 5.48, which is conflicting. Hmm. I think the correct approach is the first method because the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach isn't applicable here; it's a weak base in solution, not a buffer.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Let me recalculate the (pKb - log C)/2 approach. Because maybe I made a calculation error.

pKb is 9.267 (since Kb =5.405e-10 → pKb = 9.267). Log C is log(0.02) = log(2e-2) = log(2) + log(1e-2) = 0.3010 -2 = -1.699.

So (pKb - log C) = 9.267 - (-1.699) = 10.966. Divide by 2 →5.483. Hmm, that's about 5.48. But this doesn't match the earlier calculation.

Wait a minute, perhaps this formula is only an approximation. Because the formula pH = (pKb - log C)/2 is derived under the assumption that x is much smaller than C, which is the case here. So why the two methods are giving different results?

Wait, no. I think the confusion arises because when you have a weak base, the formula pH = (pKb - log C)/2 is correct when the solution is a weak base in water. But wait, when the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the anion. So the correct approach is the one using Kb and solving for OH^-.

Thus, the pH should be around 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is pH 4.57 and 6.92. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the equivalence point again. Wait, after the equivalence point, the solution would have excess NaOH, but in this case, 25% titration is before equivalence. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. So maybe I'm miscalculating the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution after equivalence isn't just acetate. But no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the equivalence point can be found by calculating the concentration of the sodium acetate solution.

Moles of CH3COO^- at equivalence: 0.001 moles.

Volume of solution: 40 cm³ (original) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration: 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Now, the hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02,

x^2 /0.02 =5.405e-10 → x^2 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 → [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So this suggests the pH at equivalence is about 9.02. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest equivalence pH is in option D, which is 6.92. That's way lower than 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume is different. Let me double-check the problem statement.

Problem says: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. Then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.

So, initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L=0.001 moles.

When titrated, moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 moles, which requires 0.001/0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³. So total volume at equivalence is 40 +10=50 cm³.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using Kb, but I should instead consider that the solution is a buffer. No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution after equivalence is different. No, at equivalence, it's all acetate.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is that I'm supposed to find the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume. Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which refers to the amount of acid neutralized, not the volume added.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH at 25% of the NaOH volume required to reach equivalence. Let me see: equivalence volume is 10 cm³. 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ added, which is 25% of the way to equivalence.

So, in that case, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 moles.

Which brings us back to the buffer solution scenario, as I did earlier.

In that case, the pH at 25% is 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But the equivalence pH is 9.02, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence pH.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5=5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to account for activity coefficients or something, but that's beyond the scope of this problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for a weak base's pH.

Wait, another approach: the pH of a solution of a weak base can be calculated using the formula:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C)

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. No match in options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option D:4.57;6.92

So perhaps the equivalence pH is being calculated incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M acetate. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, we've neutralized 0.001 moles of acetic acid with NaOH, producing 0.001 moles of acetate. The volume is 50 cm³, so concentration is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the Kb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka=1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So I'm confident that the pH at equivalence is about 9.02. But none of the options have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just acetate. Maybe I made a mistake in the moles of acetate.

Wait, wait a second. Let's think again about the equivalence point. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. The NaOH is added in 10 cm³, which provides 0.001 moles of OH^- (since 0.1 M * 0.01 L=0.001 moles). So all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So yes, 0.001 moles of acetate.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is not just acetate. Maybe I should consider that the solution is a mixture of acetate and Na+ ions, but that doesn't affect the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I'm not considering that the solution is a sodium acetate solution, which may have a different pH calculation. But I think I've done that correctly.

Hmm. This is getting confusing. Let me look at the options again.

If the pH at 25% is 4.26 (option A) and the equivalence is 8.52 (option A's second value), perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence pH.

Wait, wait! Let me think again. Perhaps I confused the equivalence point with the pH of the solution before any NaOH is added.

No, that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the pH at equivalence is being calculated as if it's a strong base, which it isn't.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is a buffer where the acetate is present in solution, but I think that's not the case. At equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, leaving only the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial acetic acid solution is being diluted, but perhaps I should consider the dilution differently.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water → total volume 40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence point, after adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, total volume is 50 cm³. Moles of acetate:0.001. So concentration 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm miscalculating the pOH. Let me re-calculate.

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. No match in options. So perhaps the correct pH at equivalence is not among the options, but that can't be. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the calculations for the other part. Let me compute the pH at the equivalence point using another method.

Alternative approach: The solution is 0.02 M in CH3COO^-.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] =5.405e-10.

Let [OH^-] =x. Then [CH3COOH] =x, and [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² =5.405e-10 *0.02 →x²=1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 →pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct pH at equivalence is 9.02, but none of the options have this. The closest option is A, which has 8.52 as the second value. But that's quite different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles of acetic acid. Let me check again.

Original volume:20 cm³, 0.05 M → 0.05 *0.02=0.001 moles. Correct.

Diluted with 20 cm³ →0.04 L →0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Correct.

So, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is not considering that the solution at equivalence is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, but perhaps I should consider that the pH is determined by the salt. Wait, but that's exactly what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong value for Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) =5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The only option where the first value is around 4.26 is option A, which has 4.26 and 8.52. The equivalence pH is 8.52, which is much lower than my calculated 9.02.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equivalence point is not when all the acid is neutralized, but when the moles of NaOH added are 25% of the equivalence point. No, the question specifies 25% titration as 25% of the acid neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is a different concentration. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total volume. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, volume is 40 cm³ (original) +10 cm³ (NaOH)=50 cm³=0.05 L. Correct.

Molarity of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the pH at 25% of the volume added, not 25% of the acid neutralized. Let me see.

If 25% of the equivalence volume is added, that's 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH added:0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 moles, which is 25% of the 0.001 moles needed for equivalence. So same as before. So pH is 4.26.

So, the first part is correct. Now, the equivalence pH is not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option D: 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me re-calculate.

At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer of 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of acetate, in a volume of 42.5 cm³.

pH=pKa + log (0.00025 /0.00075) = pKa + log(1/3)=pKa -0.477.

pKa is 4.733, so pH=4.733-0.477=4.256≈4.26. So option A's first value is correct.

Now, equivalence pH is 9.02, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the approximation that at equivalence, the pH is 7 because the salt is neutral. But that's incorrect because acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic, not neutral.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering the solution at equivalence as 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps it's not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it should be basic, pH>7. So I'm confident that the pH should be around 9.02.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is asking for the pH at 25% of the way to the equivalence point, but in terms of volume, not moles. Oh! That's a possibility.

Wait, the equivalence point is at 10 cm³. 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 moles, which is 25% of the required 0.001 moles. So it's the same as before. So the pH is 4.26.

Hmm. So perhaps the equivalence pH is not matching any option, but the only option with pH near 4.26 is option A, which has pH 8.52 at equivalence. But that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the equivalence point. Let me compute it using a different approach. Maybe the solution's pH is incorrectly calculated.

Another approach: the pH at equivalence can be determined by the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The formula is:

pH = pKa2 + log(C), where pKa2 is the second dissociation constant of water. Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

Wait, the general formula for the pH of a salt, say, B from a weak acid HB and strong base BOH, is:

pH = (pKa + pKw - log C)/2.

Wait, pKa is the pKa of the acid, pKw is 14. So,

pH = (pKa +14 - log C)/2.

In this case, pKa of acetic acid is 4.733, C is 0.02 M.

So,

pH = (4.733 +14 - log(0.02))/2.

log(0.02)= -1.69897.

So,

pH = (4.733 +14 - (-1.699))/2 = (4.733 +14 +1.699)/2 = (20.432)/2=10.216.

Wait, that's about 10.22, which is even higher than before. That can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps that formula is incorrect. Another approach: perhaps the formula is pH = (pKa + pKw - log C)/2. But I'm getting confused. Let me look for the correct formula.

The correct formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid (HA) and strong base (like NaOH) is:

pH = (pKw - pKa + log C)/2.

Wait, let me think. For a salt B from a weak acid HA and strong base, the solution is basic. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of B^-.

The formula for pH is:

pH = (pKw - pKa + log C) / 2.

So, pKa is 4.733, pKw is14.

So,

pH = (14 -4.733 + log(0.02)) / 2.

log(0.02) is -1.69897.

So,

pH = (9.267 + (-1.69897)) /2 = (7.568)/2≈3.784. That's not matching earlier calculations.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should refer back to the initial calculation, which gave me 9.02. Given that none of the options match, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, wait! Another possibility: perhaps the problem is that the solution after dilution is being titrated, so the concentrations are different. Let me recompute the moles.

Wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Moles=0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 moles. Correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH=0.001, volume=10 cm³. So solution volume=50 cm³=0.05 L.

So acetate concentration=0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation. Let me set up the equation without assuming x is negligible.

The Kb expression:

x² = Kb * C * (1 - x/C).

But that's a quadratic equation, which might be more accurate.

So,

x² =5.405e-10 *0.02*(1 - x/0.02)

Assuming x is small, 1 -x/0.02 ≈1, so we get x≈1.04e-5 as before.

But perhaps for more accuracy, let me solve it without approximation.

x² = (5.405e-10 *0.02) * (1 - x/0.02)

=1.081e-11 (1 - x/0.02)

So,

x² + (1.081e-11 * x/0.02) -1.081e-11 =0.

This is a quadratic equation in x, but the coefficients are very small. Solving:

a=1

b=(1.081e-11 /0.02)=5.405e-10

c= -1.081e-11.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a

But since x is positive,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 =2.921e-19

4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11 → but in the formula, it's 4ac, so 4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11= approx 4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(4.324e-11)= 6.576e-6.

Thus,

x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, this is different. So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.487 → pH=14-5.487=8.513.

Ah! So about 8.51. Which matches option A's second value, which is 8.52.

Wait, so this is about 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

So perhaps the initial approximation was incorrect, and the more accurate calculation gives pH≈8.51, which rounds to 8.52.

So now the equivalence pH is approximately 8.52, matching option A's second value.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is \( 40 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The new concentration is:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of NaOH added**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH**:  
  \[
  0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed**:  
  \[
  0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Buffer solution**: The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right).
  \]
  - \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
  - The ratio of acetate to acetic acid is:  
    \[
    \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \frac{1}{3}.
    \]
  - Substituting:  
    \[
    \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
    \]

---

### **Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)).  
- **Concentration of acetate ions**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **Hydrolysis of acetate**: The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The \( K_b \) for acetate is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
- **Equilibrium calculation**: Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
  \]
  Assuming \( x \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:  
  \[
  K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
  \]
  Solving for \( x \):  
  \[
  x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
  \]
  Thus, \( [\text{OH}^-] \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \), and:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]

---

### **Step 4: Refining the Equivalence Point Calculation**
A more precise calculation without approximations gives:  
\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \cdot (1 - x / [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]),
\]
which leads to \( x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \). Thus:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.487, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.487 = 8.513 \approx 8.52.
\]

---

### **Final Results**
- **pH at 25% titration**: \( 4.26 \).  
- **pH at equivalence point**: \( 8.52 \).  

These values match **Option A**.
