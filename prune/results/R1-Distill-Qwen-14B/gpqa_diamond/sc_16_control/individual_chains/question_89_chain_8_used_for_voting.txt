Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see if I can figure it out.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has that diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like molecule, right? So 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. 

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so elimination reactions usually happen here. Wait, but wait! Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe an E2 elimination would occur. But wait, in the case of vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), treatment with a strong base like KOH typically leads to the formation of an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. So the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the two bromides leave, forming a double bond. So the product here should be an adamantene with a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions. 

Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3. So if they're on adjacent positions, maybe the double bond forms between 1 and 2, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, so elimination would form a double bond in a bridge. Hmm, but regardless, the product is an alkene. 

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. Also, the ¹H NMR spectrum has specific peaks. Let's see: 4.79 ppm (2H). That's probably a -CH2- group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or a carbonyl. Wait, but wait the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Wait, but if the starting material is two bromines on adamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's an elimination, but maybe it's a substitution? But substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is, but KOH is a base. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's not a substitution. The IR's 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. So how do we get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Oh! Maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination usually gives an alkene. Hmm, but perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: When a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, sometimes when the dihalide is on adjacent carbons (vicinal dihalide), the base can cause elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the IR is showing a carbonyl. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate to form an alkene but undergoes a substitution to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait! If the base is strong, perhaps a neighboring group participation occurs. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to a conjugate base that forms a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm not quite getting this.

Wait, let me re-examine the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a doublet maybe? Or a triplet? The question says 4.79 (2H), perhaps as a singlet, but the integration is 2H. So maybe it's a -CH2-O- group, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but that would have a different NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with neighboring protons. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is an adamantanol or something with an alcohol group, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch. Oh, but the IR shows 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where two bromides are replaced by a ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe it's a keto elimination. Another thought: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can form an oxide bridge, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so when two adjacent carbons have Br atoms, perhaps upon treatment with strong base, a ketone is formed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double substitution, but that would require two substitution steps, which is less likely with KOH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? No, because the NMR doesn't show more than three sets of peaks. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give diol, but the IR would show broad O-H stretch, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the 2.4-2.2 range might be from the bridgehead protons in adamantane. The 1.94 is 2H, perhaps a CH2 group. The 4.79 is 2H, perhaps another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, if the product is a diepoxide, but then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. So maybe it's not an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol. But again, the IR would show O-H stretch, which isn't indicated. So perhaps the product is a ketone. So maybe each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. Wait, no, each Br on 1 and 3 positions, so perhaps forming a ketone at each position. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which would give a higher molecular weight and possibly different NMR. Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: when a vicinal dihalide is treated with KOH, it can form a ketone via elimination. Wait, no, elimination forms alkenes. Is there a reaction that forms a ketone from a dihalide? Oh! Wait, there's the possibility of a neighboring group participation. Like in the formation of epoxides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where the two Br groups are removed, and a carbonyl is formed. Wait, perhaps the base deprotonates a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a carbene or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, but bridgehead carbons typically can't form double bonds because of their structure, so elimination to form a double bond isn't possible. So perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group instead.

Wait, maybe the base induces the formation of a carbonyl group via a hydride shift or some other mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by an O- group, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would form an oxide, but again, the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which could be an -O-CH2-O- structure, but that's speculative.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see: the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong, sharp peak, suggesting a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

So how do you get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, with the base abstracting two β-hydrogens and removing both bromides, forming a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require two eliminations, which is possible. So maybe each Br leaves, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that would require each Br to be eliminated, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs on adjacent bridgeheads. So maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group between those carbons. So the product would be a ketone where the two bridgehead carbons are now part of a carbonyl group.

Wait, so perhaps the product is a ketone, and the structure is something like an adamantane ring with a carbonyl group. So the NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl as being deshielded. But then, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for CH2 next to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe they are part of an ether group, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the next steps. So product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone, so maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something?

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts typically requires aromatic rings. Adamantane isn't aromatic. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of enol formation or other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But then, the IR would have O-H stretch. Since the IR doesn't mention that, maybe it's a ketone.

Another thought: Maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. So, perhaps not.

Wait, going back, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but of both bromines. So two substitutions to form an O-containing group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group, making a diol. But then the IR would show O-H stretch, which isn't indicated. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't support that. I'm really stuck on what product 1 is.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl, and the NMR is showing the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet of two protons. If it's a carbonyl group, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. That would make sense. Adamantane with a ketone at the 1 position. Then, the 1H NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. So the two H's on the adjacent carbon would be deshielded and appear around 2.5 ppm, perhaps. But the NMR shows 4.79 for two H's, which is higher ppm, more upfield than I would expect for a ketone adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 (2H) might be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, perhaps oxygen. So maybe it's a secondary alcohol or an ether. But if it's an ether, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong. So it's a carbonyl, probably a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps the base induces elimination to form a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form an alcohol, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but the two bromide groups are removed, and two hydroxyl groups are formed, which then lose water to form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, which again, doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm. Maybe I should move on for a moment and think about the next steps. Maybe product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. So product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed under Friedel-Crafts conditions. Oh wait, but Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, and Friedel-Crafts requires aromatic rings, which adamantane doesn't have. So maybe product 1 isn't a ketone but another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is an ester or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think of the overall process. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, followed by work-up with dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive work-up. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, the initial product 1 is from a reaction with KOH, which is likely an elimination. So product 1 is an alkene. Then, when product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, maybe a ring-opening or a rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But earlier we thought that the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol with some adjacent substituents.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach this differently.

The IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement. Wait, but how? Maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed (due to Bredt's rule). So maybe the double bond isn't at the bridgehead but elsewhere, but in adamantane, all bridgehead positions are similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group via a different mechanism. Wait, maybe the base induces the formation of a geminal diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. But that would require two hydroxyl groups on the same carbon, which would need both Brs on the same carbon, which they're not.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would form a cyclic structure, maybe an oxide ring. But the IR would then have a peak for the C-O-C bond, not a carbonyl.

This is getting me nowhere. Let me think again about the first reaction.

1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O), NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's 1-adamantanone. Then, the structure is adamantane with a ketone at position 1. The NMR would have the ketone at around 2.5 ppm for the adjacent CH2 groups, but in the given NMR, the 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which could be the bridgehead protons, and the 1.94 is perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, but the 4.79 ppm (2H) would be a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is something like a secondary alcohol or an ether, but that's conflicting with the IR. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an ester. But then the IR would show an ester carbonyl, which is around 1740 cm⁻¹. The given IR is at 1720, which is more consistent with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, but in an adamantane framework. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. Maybe each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which isn't indicated in the NMR.

I'm really stuck on this. Maybe I should try to think about the later steps and see if that helps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. So product 1 is a ketone. Aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts, but since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. Then, heating it with aluminum isopropoxide may cause some kind of acylation. But without an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an acid chloride, but that would require a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a primary alcohol, which when treated with Al(OiPr)3, undergoes some kind of dehydration to form an alkene. But the IR doesn't show a carbonyl in that case, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should move to the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 forms product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Looking at product 3's NMR: the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange. So perhaps in product 3, there's a carbonyl group, and the adjacent hydrogen would be deshielded. But we're to find the coupling pattern.

Wait, but let me think: product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would be a di-ketone or two ketones connected by some structure.

Wait, but product 2 comes from product 1 treated with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an enolate. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a ring-opened product.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone. But in adamantane, perhaps it's a bridgehead ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide. But the IR doesn't show that. Hmm.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow, IR C=O at 1720, NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H)).
   - Product 1 is a ketone.

2. Product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2.
   - Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it's used to form an enol or facilitate some kind of alkylation.

3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

So, putting it all together, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 would be an alkene derived from product 1. Because when product 2 is ozonolyzed, you get product 3 with carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product (with carbonyl groups), then in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In the ozonolysis of a simple alkene, say ethylene, you'd get two carbonyl groups. But in more complex structures, the splitting would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Let's think about possible structures.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, perhaps the structure has two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, if the alkene in product 2 was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyls, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

So, each CH2 group would have two protons. Each proton would be next to the carbonyl and adjacent to the other CH2 group. So each proton would have two neighboring groups, perhaps leading to a triplet or another splitting pattern.

Wait, but if the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. Each CH2 group would have two protons. Each proton on a CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group, which has two protons. So the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and a CH2 group. So each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. Suppose each CH2 is next to another CH2 group. Each H in a CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's two Hs. Since each H in the adjacent CH2 is equivalent, the coupling would be a triplet.

But wait, each H in the CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2, which would cause each to be a triplet. So the most deshielded H (those next to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl is on each end. So if the starting alkene was between two CH2 groups, like CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would give O=C-CH2-O something? No, wait, ozonolysis of a simple internal alkene like CH2=CH2 would give two formaldehyde molecules, but in a more complex structure, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH2)2(CO)2. So each CH2 is connected to a carbonyl. The two Hs on each CH2 would be adjacent to the other CH2 group. So each H would couple with two Hs on the neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the two CH2 groups are on either side of the carbonyl, then each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. So each CH2's Hs would be next to another CH2 with two Hs, so each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Each H in a CH2 group would have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2, so each H would be a triplet.

So in product 3, the most deshielded Hs (on the CH2 groups next to carbonyls) would be triplets.

Looking back at the options:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

So the correct answer would be A) triplet.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: if the CH2 groups are adjacent to each other, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But if the coupling is to two different sets of Hs, perhaps it's more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the Hs are coupled to two different groups, maybe leading to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 are next to another CH2 group which is also next to a carbonyl. So each H would have two neighboring Hs (from adjacent CH2) and perhaps another coupling. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are next to a CH2 group which has two Hs, making a triplet, and also coupled to another set of Hs elsewhere. But without the exact structure, it's a bit hard to say.

Wait, but in the initial product 1's NMR, the 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. But product 3's Hs adjacent to carbonyls would be more deshielded, perhaps appearing around 2.1 ppm, but in the NMR data given for product 3, we don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. So each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 group and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, no, because each CH2 has two Hs, so each H would only couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps each H in the CH2 group is coupled to two Hs (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern is a triplet. Therefore, the answer would be A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH at 240°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a ketone.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).  
   - This suggests that product 1 is a ketone, likely 1-adamantanone, where the carbonyl group is at position 1 of the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates the formation of a double bond (alkene) in product 2.  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to be an alkene, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds.

3. **Ozonolysis and work-up**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive work-up with dimethyl sulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern.  
   - No additional coupling is observed with other hydrogens, as the question specifies excluding exchangeable hydrogens.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**. 

Answer: A
