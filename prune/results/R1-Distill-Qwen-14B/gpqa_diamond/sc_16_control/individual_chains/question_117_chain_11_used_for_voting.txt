Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each compound to see if they have any such centers.

The question lists four compounds, and the options are combinations of which ones show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. Since it's a biphenyl, I'm wondering if the substituents create any chiral centers. Wait, the carboxylate ester groups are on positions 2 and 2' of each ring. Are those positions adjacent to any chiral centers? Wait, the ester groups are O-C-O structures. Each ester group is a methyl ester, so maybe the carbonyl is part of a ring. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the central part is a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, no, it's biphenyl, two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So each ring has substituents. The 2 and 2' positions on each ring have the ester groups. Wait, but the carbons where the substituents are attached—do they have four different groups?

Each ring's substituent is a carbonyl group (since it's a carboxylate ester, the structure is O-CO-OCH3). So the carbon attached to the oxygen in the ester—like the carbonyl carbon—is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl, not a chiral center. Then maybe the next carbon? Wait, perhaps the biphenyl's central carbon is connected to two rings and two substituents. Wait, no, the biphenyl structure is where two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) has two rings and two substituents? Let me think. Each benzene ring is connected at the 1 position, so the central single bond is between C1 of each benzene. So the central carbon is part of both rings. So the substituents are on C6 and C2 of each ring. Wait, maybe the substituents are on each ring, but the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups. So perhaps that carbon can't be chiral because it's part of both rings, but maybe the substituents on the rings create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the ring in positions that could create a chiral center. Each ring has a nitro group and an ester group. So the positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but if the substituents are at 2 and 6, are they meta to each other? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each ring has two substituents (nitro and ester) at positions 2 and 6. But in any case, the biphenyl structure could allow for the possibility of the compound being chiral because of the arrangement of substituents around the central bond. Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on this. Maybe it's similar to how biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism when substituents are on adjacent positions. But optical isomerism is about chirality, not just geometric isomerism. So I'm not sure about this one yet. Let me put a pin in it and move on.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(COOH)CH2-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? Or is it HOCH2COOCH3? Wait, no. The structure for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when it's esterified with methanol, the -OH is replaced by OMe. So the structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, the -OH becomes OMe. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, the molecule is then (CH3)(CH2OCH3)(COOCH3) with the central carbon being CH(OH). So the central carbon is attached to:

1. CH3,
2. COOCH3,
3. OH,
4. and the other CH2 group? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH3)
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- OH
- and the other adjacent CH2... Wait, no, the structure should be:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the carbons are arranged as:

- The first carbon is CH3.
- The second carbon is CH(OH).
- The third is COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1)
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- OH
- And another CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the previous carbon)
2. COOCH3 (from the next carbon)
3. OH
4. And the next carbon (which is the same as above? Wait, no, each carbon is connected to its adjacent carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) has four substituents: 

- one CH3 (from the left),
- one COOCH3 (from the right),
- one OH,
- and the other substituent is a CH2 group? Wait, no, each carbon in a chain is connected to two other carbons and two other groups. Wait, the central carbon in this case is the one attached to the OH. So the groups are:

- a CH3 group (on the left),
- a COOCH3 group (on the right),
- an OH group,
- and the other substituent is a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH(OH), which is connected to:

- CH3 (previous carbon)
- COOCH3 (next carbon)
- OH
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the chain is three carbons long. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen (since it's a central carbon in a chain, it's connected to four groups: two from the chain and two substituents). Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so it has four bonds: one to C1 (CH3), one to C3 (COOCH3), one OH, and one hydrogen. So, substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, all four groups are different. So this would be a chiral center, meaning the compound shows optical isomerism. So compound 2 should exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone. Structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, an oxygen double bond (the ketone), and a single bond to another carbon? No, wait, the structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. That carbon is only connected to two phenyl groups and the O. So no, the central carbon is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded (so no four substituents). Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't show optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is an ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diacid, so dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups. Structure is O=C-(CH2)CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (Z)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid? Or wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Wait, no, wait: Maleic acid is (Z), fumaric is (E). So the structure is O=C-(CH2)CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans (E) configuration. So when it's the acid, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when it's converted to dimethyl fumarate, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3? Wait, no, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that can’t be. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups on a double bond. So structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. The correct structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So when it's dimethyl ester, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOOCH3? No, no. Let me get this right: fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the two ends is a COOH group. So when esterified with methanol, each becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would imply a four-carbon chain, but it's actually a two-carbon chain with double bond. So the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is O=C(CH2COOCH3)-CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Let me think: the fumarate ion is the conjugate base of fumaric acid. So the structure is O=C-(CH2)-CH2-COOCH3? I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. No, that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups, and the structure is such that it's a trans diene. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each COOCH3 group is attached to adjacent carbons across a double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is (Z) or (E) isomer? Fumarate is the (E) isomer. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is O=C-(CH2)CH2-COOCH3? No, perhaps it's better to think about whether the compound has a double bond between two carbons, each of which is attached to an ester group.

So the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. But that would be a four-carbon structure. Wait, no: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So its ester would be O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3, but as the dimethyl ester, both the ends are esterified. So the structure is O=C(CH2COOCH3)-CH2COOCH3? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond, which would make it succinic acid dimethyl ester, which doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3 as the dimethyl ester. But that would have two ester groups on either end of a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule might not be chiral. Alternatively, in some cases, the molecule could have a chiral center. Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are across a double bond but are identical groups. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule would not be chiral. Wait, but wait, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, no—fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, both ends are esters. So it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, both ends are esters, so it's O=C(CH2COOCH3)-CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think of it as a molecule with two ester groups on each end of a double bond.

So the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond, which is succinic acid. Fumarate has a double bond. So the correct structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, that can’t be. Wait, perhaps I should look at the formula. Fumarate is C4H2O4 (as the acid is C4H4O4, but as the ester, perhaps it's C6H10O4). Wait, dimethyl fumarate would be (CH3O)2C-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the two substituents are the same on either side of the double bond, making it symmetrical. But if the substituents are the same, the molecule might not be chiral. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is an unsaturated ester. Wait, but if the substituents on either end are identical (both are COOCH3), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So it wouldn't have any optical isomerism. Wait, but I think that's not the case. Wait, no. Wait, let's think about this: if the two substituents on the double bond are identical, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate wouldn't have optical isomerism. But wait, I've heard that dimethyl maleate and fumarate are used as examples of diastereomers. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another angle: if the substituents on either end are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 group. So the structure across the double bond is symmetric. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, wait—another possibility: if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center adjacent to the double bond. But in this case, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting mixed up between maleic and fumaric acid. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric is the trans. But the ester would have the same arrangement. So if the substituents are on the same side (cis), that's maleate; if opposite (trans), that's fumarate. But in any case, whether cis or trans, if the substituents are identical, the molecule might not be chiral. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule to have optical isomerism, there must be a chiral center or another form of chirality, like a plane of asymmetry. In dimethyl fumarate, the central part is a double bond with two identical ester groups on either end. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. So it doesn't have optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: when the substituents are the same, the molecule can't be chiral. So if both substituents are COOCH3, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. So no optical isomerism. So compound 4 is out.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure could be O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond, which is succinic acid. No, fumarate is a diacid with a double bond. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that can't be. So perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond, which is a different compound.

Wait, I'm really getting stuck here. Let me try to imagine the structure. Dimethyl fumarate would have the structure (CH3O)2C=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each end is an ester group. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond, so it's succinic acid's ester, which doesn't have a double bond. So, I'm confused. Maybe I should move on and come back to this.

So, summarizing what I have so far:

1. I'm not sure yet, but maybe it has a chiral center.
2. Yes, has a chiral center (so optical isomerism).
3. No chiral centers.
4. Maybe no, but I'm not confident.

Wait, so the options are:

A) 1, 2, 4
B) 3 and4 → 3 doesn't, 4 maybe no.
C) 2 and3 → 2 yes, 3 no.
D) 1 and 2 → 2 yes, 1 ?

Back to compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions.

Wait, the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6 relative to the point of connection.

Now, the question is, does this substitution create any chiral centers? Let me think about the substituents.

Each ring's substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So for each ring, the substituents are on opposite sides (para to the point of attachment). Now, the point of attachment is position 1 on each benzene.

Wait, but each substituent is at 2 and 6, which are on the same ring. So the substituents are on the same ring, but opposite positions relative to the point of attachment.

Now, the central bond is between the two rings, so the molecule has a single bond there. So, could this create a possibility of the molecule being chiral?

Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has the same substituents—nitro and ester. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. But wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, on each ring, the substituents are in the same positions relative to the point of attachment. Therefore, the two rings are mirror images of each other, leading to an overall symmetrical molecule. So, it might not be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: biphenyl compounds can have optical isomerism if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical.

But in this case, since each ring has the same substituents at 2 and 6, the molecule is symmetrical. So it's not chiral. Thus, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Each substituent is on the same ring, but perhaps the arrangement across the biphenyl axis creates a chiral environment. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

So, considering all that, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are:

2: yes.

What about 4, dimethyl fumarate? Earlier I thought it doesn't, but perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, another angle: fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure O=C-(CH2)CH-COOCH3, but wait, no, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a double bond and whether the substituents are in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, perhaps the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to an ester group and another substituent. If the substituents are different, then perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that doesn’t make sense. Alternatively, it's O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's a single bond. Fumarate must have a double bond. So the correct structure is O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, that can’t be, because that would imply four carbons, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(CH2COOCH3)-CH2COOCH3, but that would be a four-carbon chain, which isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's succinic acid. No, that's not fumarate.

I'm really stuck on compound 4. Let me try to find another approach.

If a molecule has double bond geometry (cis or trans), does that contribute to optical isomerism? No, because optical isomerism is about chirality, not E/Z isomerism. So, even if the substituents are arranged in a trans configuration, that's a geometric isomer, not a chiral center.

So dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but the molecule's substituents are arranged in a trans configuration. However, since the substituents on either end are identical (both are COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical and hence achiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But wait, looking back at the options, none of the options say only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → but 4 doesn't, and 1 doesn't.

B) 3 and4 → both don't.

C) 2 and3 → 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and2 → 1 doesn't.

Wait, none of the options include only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4.

Another approach: dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on either end of a double bond. So, structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. But that's four carbons, which isn't correct. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the ester would be O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. That's two ester groups on a double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, that would imply each end is an ester. So the structure would be O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. But that can't be correct because it would imply a five-carbon structure, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that's a single bond and would be succinic acid ester.

Hmm, maybe I should think of dimethyl fumarate as (Z)- or (E)-configured. But in either case, if the substituents are the same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the substituents on the double bond are not the same. No, wait, both ends are ester groups, so same substituents.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2. But looking back at the options, none have only 2 selected. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → but 4 doesn't.
B) 3 and4 → no.
C) 2 and3 → 3 doesn't.
D) 1 and2 → 1 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6 relative to the point of connection (1 and 1'). So each ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group. Are the substituents on each ring arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral?

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral. So, for example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical.

In this case, each benzene ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate group. Let's imagine the substituents on each ring: position 2 is adjacent to the point of attachment (position 1), and position 6 is para to position 2. So, substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Now, the arrangement could be such that the substituents on the two rings are mirror images, leading to a symmetrical molecule. Or, they could be arranged asymmetrically, leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

But in this case, since each ring has the same substituents, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on one ring are in the ortho and para positions relative to the point of attachment, but on the other ring, they're in meta positions. Wait, no, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, in a benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (the point of attachment), and position 6 is across from position 2 (opposite direction). So, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical because each ring has the same substituents. So, the molecule can be rotated 180 degrees and look the same, making it achiral.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=CH with ester groups on either end. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond. Alternatively, it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3, but as the dimethyl ester, both ends are esterified. So, it's O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3 → no, that's not correct because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would be O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, but that's only one ester. Wait, no, both ends are esterified. So, the structure is O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond, making it succinic acid's ester, which doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think of the correct structure. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -OH is replaced by OCH3. So, the structure is O=C-CH=CH-COOCH3 → but that's the monoester. Wait, no, the diester would have both ends esterified. So, the structure is O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is (CH2COOCH3)2C=CH. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that I don't know this structure and try another approach. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. If the structure has two ester groups on either end of a double bond, but the substituents on each end are the same (both COOCH3), then the molecule is symmetrical. So, it wouldn't have any chiral centers, meaning no optical isomerism. Therefore, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2.
B) 3 and4 → no.
C) 2 and3 → includes 2.
D) 1 and2 → includes 2.

But the correct answer would be only 2, but the options don't include that. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misjudged compound 1. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2. So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the point of attachment. So, each ring has a nitro group para to the point of attachment (since 2 and 6 are across from each other).

Wait, in the biphenyl structure, the point of attachment is position 1 on each ring. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1, and position 6 is across from position 2. Therefore, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 (adjacent to 1) and 6 (across from 2). So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Wait, perhaps this arrangement makes the molecule symmetrical. So, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to their respective points of attachment. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the axis connecting the two points of attachment, making it achiral. So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that does is 2. But none of the options include just 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. No, that can't be right because that's only one ester. Wait, the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that's a single bond, which is succinic acid ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, which is a single bond, so no double bond. But that can’t be because fumaric acid has a double bond.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think about this differently. If a molecule has a double bond and the substituents on each side are different, can it have optical isomerism? No, because a double bond doesn't contribute to chirality. Only a chiral center can.

So, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. So, compound 4 doesn't show it.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But in the options, only option A includes 2 along with others. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)2C=CH2, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a chiral center adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule has a chiral center at one end of the double bond. For example, one end of the double bond could have a carbonyl group, and the other end has an ester group. But if both ends have the same substituents, it won't be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a substituent that creates a chiral center. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent and to avoid getting stuck indefinitely, I'll proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, did I make a mistake with compound 1? Let me think again. Suppose each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, the substituents on each ring are para. So the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should check again the structures for each compound.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (CHOH) is bonded to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),
2. COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
3. OH,
4. and a hydrogen?

Wait, that can't be right. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the adjacent carbon (CH2? No, it's CH(OH) connected to CH3 and COOCH3 on either side. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is:

- connected to CH3 on one side,
- connected to COOCH3 on the other side,
- and has an OH group and a hydrogen.

So, the groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different, making it a chiral center. So, yes, compound 2 has optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer must include compound 2. Looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4 (but I don't think 1 and 4 do), option D includes 1 and 2 (but 1 doesn't), option C includes 2 and3 (3 doesn't), and option A includes 2.

So, the only option with 2 is option A, but I'm not sure about 4.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. If I'm wrong about it, the answer could be option A.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has double bond between two carbons, each attached to two different groups, but in this case, both are ester groups (same groups), so no. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, which has a single bond. But then, if the substituents are in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere, like on the CH2 groups. But in that case, each CH2 would have two identical substituents, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, but that's a different compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-configured, but since both substituents are the same, it can't be chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in conclusion, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. The substituents on each ring are nitro and ester. Are these substituents in positions that cause the molecule to lack symmetry?

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the overall structure asymmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, considering the biphenyl structure, if the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, the nitro groups on each ring might be on the same side, leading to an asymmetrical arrangement.

Alternatively, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides, the molecule could be symmetrical.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. But I think that if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl system allows for the possibility of the molecule being chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule could exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent and across from the point of attachment. So, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, combining all this, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2. So, looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 1 didn't have optical isomerism. So, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps only compound 2 does, but since the options don't include that, perhaps I should choose option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think of another approach.

The question is about which compounds show optical isomerism. So, for each compound, I need to determine if there's at least one chiral center.

Compound 1: Let's imagine the structure. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, perhaps the substituents are in positions that make each ring have a chiral center. Wait, wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring, which is planar. The carbons on the benzene are sp2 hybridized and don't have four different groups. So, they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, any substituents on the benzene ring won't create a chiral center.

Wait, that's a key point. The substituents are on the benzene ring, which can't be chiral centers because they are sp2 hybridized and have planar geometry. So, the substituents themselves (like nitro and ester) are attached to an sp2 carbon, which can't be a chiral center. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Compound 2: As established earlier, it has a chiral center, so it does.

Compound 3: Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers.

Compound 4: Dimethyl fumarate, if it has a chiral center, would exhibit optical isomerism. But if it's symmetrical, it doesn't. Earlier analysis suggests it doesn't, so it doesn't.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that it has a chiral center. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, which is a single bond, so no double bond. But that's succinic acid's ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, which would have a double bond. But in that case, the substituents on each end of the double bond are COOCH3 and COOCH3, leading to a symmetrical molecule. So, no chiral centers.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option A includes 1, 2, and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other sources.

Wait, another angle: in compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a central double bond with two ester groups on either end. If the ester groups are on the same side (cis), it's maleate; if on opposite sides (trans), it's fumarate. But in either case, the molecule is symmetrical. So, no chiral centers.

Therefore, the only correct answer is compound 2.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 1, 2, and4 → but I think 1 and4 don't.
Option D:1 and2 → 1 doesn't.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the best fit is option A, but I don't think it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about compound 4. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, which is a single bond, then the two CH2 groups are in the middle. So, any possibility of a chiral center there? The central CH2 would be connected to two CH2 groups (from either end), so no, not a chiral center.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be only compound 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → if 4 does, then A is correct.
B) 3 and4 → no.
C) 2 and3 → no.
D) 1 and2 → no.

So, the only way option A is correct is if 4 does exhibit optical isomerism. So, perhaps I was wrong about 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think: the structure could be something like CH2=CH with substituents on each end. If the substituents are different, then perhaps a chiral center exists. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same (COOCH3), so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, if the ester groups are on a carbon that's a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. No, that can't be because that would imply a five-carbon chain.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming I made a mistake.

But in reality, I think the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two different substituents on each end, then it could have a chiral center.

Wait, but both substituents are COOCH3, which are the same. So, no.

So, I think the correct answer is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has at least one chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Since no chiral centers are present, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits **optical isomerism**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two phenyl groups. Since this carbon does not have four different groups, it is not a chiral center. Thus, benzophenone does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical ester groups on either side of the double bond. Since no chiral centers are present, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest option is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential error in the question or options.

**Answer: A**
