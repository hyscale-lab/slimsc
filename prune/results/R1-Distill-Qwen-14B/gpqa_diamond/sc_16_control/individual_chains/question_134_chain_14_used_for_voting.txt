Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but the problem here gives all the concentrations and volumes, so I must calculate it based on that.

Wait, the problem gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, when these are mixed, they'll react with each other. I guess I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me list the given data:

HCl: 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.2 M. So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole will donate one H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So it can donate 2 H+ ions per mole. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 provides OH- ions. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio to form water. So the limiting reactant here is OH-, because 0.2 is less than 0.28. So all the OH- will be used up, and some H+ will remain.

So the reaction will only neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, how does this work with the acids? Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid; does the first H+ react first, and then the second? Or does it all mix together? I think for neutralization, especially with strong acids and a strong base, both H+ ions are available for reaction. Or wait, perhaps the neutralization only goes as far as the OH- can go. So, all the OH- will react with H+ from both acids.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The OH- will react with any available H+ from the acids. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the enthalpy change would be based on how much neutralization occurs. Since each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 57 kJ (or 57,000 J) of energy.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 has two H+ per molecule. So when H2SO4 is neutralized, each mole contributes 2 H+ which would each react with OH-.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So let me see:

The total H+ available is 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles. So all OH- will be consumed, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

So the amount of neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting. Each pair releases 57 kJ.

Wait, but wait: some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is considered as two steps. For example, the first H+ is neutralized with a certain enthalpy, and the second H+ with another. But I'm a bit confused about that.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each mole of H+ contributes 57 kJ when neutralized, regardless of which acid it comes from. So if 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * 57,000 J = 11,400 J or 11.4 kJ. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy would be negative.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the problem might be considering each mole of acid contributing a certain amount. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have H2SO4, each mole can contribute two H+. But in the case where OH- is in limited supply, perhaps the neutralization is partial. So for each mole of H2SO4, you can neutralize two H+ if there's enough OH-.

In this case, OH- is 0.2 moles. The H+ from HCl is 0.1, and H2SO4 contributes 0.18. So total H+ is 0.28, which is more than the 0.2 OH- available.

So the reaction will consume all 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So how much comes from each?

Hmm, perhaps the neutralization will take H+ from both sources until the OH- is used up. So HCl and H2SO4 both contribute H+.

HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+, and H2SO4 gives 0.18. So the OH- (0.2) will take H+ from both.

So first, the 0.1 H+ from HCl will be neutralized by 0.1 OH-.

That leaves 0.1 moles of OH- remaining, which will then react with H+ from H2SO4.

But H2SO4 has 0.18 moles of H+ available. So 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4 will react with the remaining 0.1 OH-.

So in total, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized (0.1 from HCl and 0.1 from H2SO4). The rest of the H2SO4's H+ (0.08 moles) and the remaining HCl's H+ (0 moles, since all were used) are left.

Wait, but wait. So the 0.28 H+ is made up of 0.1 from HCl and 0.18 from H2SO4.

So when we neutralize 0.2, it's possible that the HCl's 0.1 is all used, and then 0.1 from H2SO4 is used.

So the total neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (57,000 J/mol) = 11,400 J, which is 11.4 kJ. But since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy is negative, so -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, let me check the units. Oh, the options are in kcal and kJ. Hmm, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, so wait, wait a minute. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as about -57 kJ per mole (per H+ neutralized). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is about -11.42 kcal. Let me convert 11.4 kJ to kcal.

1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the units wrong.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. Oh, wait, that's a possibility. For HCl, each mole contributes one H+. For H2SO4, each mole contributes two H+.

So when considering the neutralization, perhaps we need to calculate the total moles of H+ neutralized, but some sources might express the enthalpy per mole of H+.

Wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So perhaps it's the total enthalpy change from all the neutralization that occurs.

So, as calculated, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, each releasing 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy would be -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't close. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole. So perhaps the neutralization is partial for H2SO4.

Wait, let me think again. The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.1, from H2SO4 is 0.18. So OH- is 0.2.

The H+ comes from both. So the neutralization would take 0.2 H+ from the combined sources.

So, the 0.1 H+ from HCl is all neutralized, and 0.1 H+ from H2SO4 is neutralized. So 0.2 total. So the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × 57,000 J = 11,400 J = 11.4 kJ. So it's -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly that. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as 11,400 J but in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. To convert to kcal: since 1 kcal = 4184 J, dividing 11400 by 4184 gives approximately 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal. But that would be if I thought the neutralization was 0.2 moles, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me reassess.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of reaction is -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. So, for 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy would be 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ or approximately -2.72 kcal (-11,400 /4184 ≈ -2.72 kcal). So option A is -2.72 kcal. But earlier I thought the answer was 11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16 kJ, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ from H2SO4. Let me think: if the problem is considering all the H+ that can be neutralized, but in reality, the OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 eq (since each HCl contributes one H+).

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 eq of H2SO4, which can contribute 2 H+ each, so 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 eq.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.2 eq.

The neutralization will proceed until the OH- is exhausted. So 0.2 eq OH- will neutralize 0.2 eq H+.

So, the heat released is 0.2 × 57,000 J = 11,400 J = 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is not exactly an option, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two equivalents, so the calculation is done per mole of acid.

But no, because the neutralization is based on H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, another thought: when you mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2, the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 might form a precipitate, like BaSO4. Does that affect the calculation?

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. H2SO4 is a strong acid. When they react, Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O. So the reaction would produce a precipitate of BaSO4. But wait, how does that affect the neutralization?

Wait, but in this case, we have excess H+ from HCl and H2SO4. So the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would first neutralize each other, producing BaSO4 and water, and then any excess H+ would come from HCl.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't have added all the H+ together. Instead, I should first consider the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Let me rethink.

Let me calculate moles:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2:

The balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2, producing 2 moles H2O and 1 mole BaSO4 precipitate.

Each mole of H2SO4 donates 2 H+, and each Ba(OH)2 donates 2 OH-.

So the reaction consumes 2 H+ and 2 OH- per mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

So the mole ratio is 1:1.

So available moles of H2SO4: 0.09, Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, because 0.09 < 0.1.

So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 used will produce 2 moles of H2O, which releases 2 × 57 kJ? Wait, no. Wait, each mole of H+ neutralization releases 57 kJ. But in this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of H2O, which would mean 2 moles of H+ and 2 moles of OH- combine. So the enthalpy for this reaction is 2 × 57 kJ = 114 kJ per mole of reaction (per mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2).

So for 0.09 moles of H2SO4, the enthalpy change is 0.09 × 114,000 J = 10,260 J, which is 10.26 kJ. Since the reaction is exothermic, it's negative: -10.26 kJ.

Now, after this reaction, how much H+ and OH- remains?

H2SO4 was 0.09 moles, all reacted. Ba(OH)2 was 0.09 moles, leaving 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2, which contributes 0.02 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all that's left after the reaction is the excess Ba(OH)2, which is 0.01 moles. Each provides 2 OH-, so 0.01 * 2 = 0.02 moles OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction consumes 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 (since it's 1:1 with H2SO4). So the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles, which contributes 0.02 moles OH-.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and the remaining H2SO4. Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is strong, but the second is weaker. But in solution, both are completely ionized because H2SO4 is a strong acid. So in the reaction, all H2SO4 would have donated both H+.

Wait, but wait, in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, it's a neutralization reaction. So each mole of H2SO4 would react with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing two moles of H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ which neutralizes 2 OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So after the reaction, all H2SO4 is consumed (0.09 moles), and the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 moles, providing 0.02 moles OH-.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and any unreacted H2SO4. But since all H2SO4 is consumed, the only H+ is from HCl: 0.1 moles.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.02 moles.

So the next step is the neutralization between HCl's H+ and the remaining OH-.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

OH-: 0.02 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reagent here. All 0.02 moles of OH- will react with 0.02 moles of H+.

The enthalpy for this reaction is 0.02 × 57,000 J = 1,140 J, which is 1.14 kJ. So total enthalpy from this step is -1.14 kJ.

Adding the two steps:

First step: -10.26 kJ.

Second step: -1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -11.4 kJ.

Hmm, that's the same as before. So about -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more. Hmm.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again. First, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 produces two moles of H2O, which releases 2 × 57 kJ per mole of H2O? Or does each mole of H+ contribute 57 kJ.

Wait, each mole of H+ neutralization releases 57 kJ. So in the first reaction, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized (from H2SO4) and 2 moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2). So each mole of H+ contributes 57 kJ. So total H+ neutralized in this reaction is 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles. So 0.18 × 57,000 J = 10,260 J = 10.26 kJ.

Then, in the second reaction, 0.02 moles of H+ are neutralized, contributing 0.02 ×57,000 = 1,140 J = 1.14 kJ.

So total is 10.26 + 1.14 = 11.4 kJ, so total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have exactly that. Let's look again.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is -16 kJ. Hmm, not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's compute 11.4 kJ to kcal.

11.4 kJ is 11400 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

Wait, but in the first calculation, I thought the enthalpy was -11.4 kJ, but that's 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 reaction produces more than one mole of H2O. Wait, no, each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of H2O, so two H+ neutralizations.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires considering that the H2SO4's second H+ is not completely neutralized because the OH- is only in limited supply. But I think that's already accounted for in the two-step approach.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction steps. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles OH-.

Total H+: 0.28.

Total OH-: 0.2.

Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 H+ will be neutralized.

So, 0.2 × 57,000 J = 11,400 J = 11.4 kJ. So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, the problem might be that when H2SO4 is present with a base, it can only donate one H+ first, and the second H+ is a weaker acid. But in reality, H2SO4 is a strong acid; both H+ are completely ionized. So that shouldn't matter.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the second H+ from H2SO4 doesn't release as much heat, maybe around 50 kJ per mole. But I think that's more complicated and beyond the scope of this problem.

So, to sum up, the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So the correct option is A) -2.72 kcal. But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ converted into kcal. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, wait, wait. I think I'm getting confused with the units. Let me recheck.

11.4 kJ is 11,400 J.

1 kcal = 4184 J. So 11,400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ equals approximately 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct option would be A) -2.72 kcal.

But earlier, when I thought of the reaction in two steps, I got the same result. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but looking back, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly 11.4 kJ. So if the problem expects the answer in kcal, but in reality, the correct figure is 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the neutralization steps. Another way to approach this is to calculate the equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents of H+ = (0.1 + 0.18) = 0.28 eq.

Equivalents of OH- = 0.2 eq.

The neutralization will proceed with 0.2 eq, so the enthalpy is 0.2 × 57,000 J = 11,400 J = 11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So the correct option is A.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when they react, each mole of H2SO4 requires one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water. Each mole of H2SO4 donates two H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 donates two OH-.

So, moles of H2SO4: 0.09, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is limiting.

So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. This produces 0.18 moles of H2O (since 2 per mole of H2SO4).

Each mole of H2O releases about 57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Wait, no, each mole of H2O is formed by neutralization of one H+ and one OH-.

Wait, perhaps each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2 would neutralize 2 moles of H+ and 2 moles of OH-. So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized, releasing 2 × 57 kJ.

So for 0.09 moles, it's 0.09 × 2 × 57,000 J = 10,260 J = 10.26 kJ.

After this reaction, the remaining OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles, which gives 0.02 moles OH-.

The HCl contributes 0.1 moles H+.

So neutralization between HCl's H+ and OH-: moles of OH- is 0.02, so 0.02 ×57,000 J = 1,140 J = 1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: 10.26 + 1.14 = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as 11.4 kJ in different units. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but why is option D present as -16.0 kJ? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of H2O, each contributing 57 kJ. So total for that reaction is 2 × 57 × 0.09 = 10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ from HCl is 0.1, and the remaining OH- is 0.02. So 0.02 ×57 = 1.14 kJ. So total is 11.4 kJ.

Hmm. So I'm confident the correct answer is -11.4 kJ or approximately -2.72 kcal.

So the correct option is A) -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

### Step 1: Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **HCl**:  
  Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

- **H₂SO₄**:  
  Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  As H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides \( 2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), so total \( \text{OH}^- = 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Identify the limiting reactant
The total moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) are \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and the total moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) are \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \). Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) will be neutralized.

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization for each mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \), the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert units if necessary
To convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kilocalories (kcal):  
\[
1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal}, \quad -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated value of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: This is inconsistent with the calculation, as it incorrectly represents the enthalpy in kcal without proper conversion.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A
