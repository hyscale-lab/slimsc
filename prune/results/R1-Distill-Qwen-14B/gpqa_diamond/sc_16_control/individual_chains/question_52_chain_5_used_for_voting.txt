Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked. 

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT))

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels.
- ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this case, the observed ratio (n1/n2) is decreasing when the star has spots. Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, but the question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2 decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower. 

Wait, let me clarify: when there are no spots, Teff is higher (6000 K). When there are spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So the effective temperature of the photosphere has changed.

So the ratio (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)). Because the equation is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, wait. Let's get that straight. The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ) when considering n2/n1. So rearranged, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). 

So if we're looking at the ratio n1/n2, that would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). 

But the problem mentions that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms (Ti I) in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. 

Wait, wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Let me think. Let's assume level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. 

So for the no-spot case (T=6000 K), the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*6000)).

When spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio becomes (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*5500)).

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k*6000) )

Ratio when spots present is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k*5500) )

But wait, the question says the ratio R = n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So R1 > R2, because when the temperature is lower, the ratio decreases. 

So the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is R1/R2.

Calculating R1/R2 = [ exp( ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(6000) - 1/(5500) ] )

Wait, no. Let me compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k*6000) - ΔE/(k*5500) = (ΔE/k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] 

Which is (ΔE/k) [ (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) ] 

Wait, 1/6000 minus 1/5500 → (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) → (-500) / (33,000,000) → -500/(3.3e7) → approximately -1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/k) * (-1.515e-5) 

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)*(-1.515e-5) )

Hmm, but I need to find R1/R2, which is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So, R1 (no spots) divided by R2 (spots).

But wait, R1 is the ratio when no spots (higher T), R2 is when spots (lower T). And the ratio R1 is higher than R2 because the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

So, R1/R2 would be a number greater than 1.

But wait, in the equation above, the exponent is negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1, meaning R1/R2 is less than 1. That can't be right because R1 is higher than R2.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the exponent signs. Let's go back.

The ratio R is n1/n2.

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T1)) where T1=6000.

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T2)) where T2=5500.

So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because:

R1/R2 = [exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, wait, 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500. So 1/T1 < 1/T2. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is (some positive ΔE/k) multiplied by negative.

So exp(negative number) is a fraction less than 1. So R1/R2 is less than 1. But that's not possible because R1 is larger than R2.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's think differently. 

Let me compute the exponent properly.

The exponent in R1 is E = ΔE/(k*T1) = (E2-E1)/(k*T1)

The exponent in R2 is E' = (E2-E1)/(k*T2)

So R1/R2 = exp( E ) / exp( E' ) = exp(E - E') 

Which is exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Compute 1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4) = -1.515e-5 K^-1

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5)

But (E2-E1) is the energy difference, which is positive because E2 > E1.

So (E2-E1)/(k) is positive. Multiply by (-1.515e-5) → negative exponent.

So R1/R2 = exp( negative number ) → which is less than 1.

Wait, but this can't be right because when T decreases, the exponential factor in R decreases, so R1 is bigger than R2, which would make R1/R2 greater than 1. So I'm getting conflicting information here.

Wait, no. Let's think again. How does the ratio n1/n2 depend on temperature?

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

If T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller because ΔE/(k T) is larger. So exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases as T decreases.

So, as T goes down, n1/n2 goes down. So R1 (no spots, T=6000) is bigger than R2 (spots, T=5500). So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But according to the exponent calculation, R1/R2 is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

But 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so their difference is negative. So the exponent is negative, so R1/R2 is less than 1. Which contradicts our earlier conclusion.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up in the exponents. Let me redo the math more carefully.

The ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

The ratio when spots is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )

Compute [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 /33e6 = -(5e2)/(3.3e7) )= -5/(33000) )= approximately -1.515e-5.

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k) * (-1.515e-5) )

But (ΔE/k) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So R1/R2 = exp( negative ) → which is a value less than 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if R1 is larger than R2, their ratio would be greater than 1. But our calculation says it's less than 1. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the ratio.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. R1 is the ratio when the star has no spots, which is higher T. R2 is the ratio when it has spots, lower T.

The question states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1 → R1/R2 > 1.

But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is exp( negative ), which is less than 1. That's a contradiction.

So I must have messed up the setup. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio backward. What if the ratio they're looking at is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2?

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)"—it doesn't specify which way. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So if R = n1/n2, and R decreases when spots are present, then R1 > R2 → R1/R2 > 1.

But according to our earlier setup, R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500) ), which is exp( negative ), so <1.

Hmm. So maybe I should switch the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (n2/n1) instead, because that could change the outcome.

Wait, let's think about it. Suppose the ratio they are talking about is n2/n1, which is the opposite of n1/n2.

Then, when the star has spots, n2/n1 increases because the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

So if the ratio increases, then R2 > R1, and R1/R2 would be less than 1.

But according to the problem statement, the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R = n1/n2 is the ratio that's decreasing. So n1/n2 = R → R1 > R2 → R1/R2 > 1, but our calculation says R1/R2 < 1. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the exponent.

Let me rederive the equation.

n1 is the lower energy level, n2 is the higher energy level.

Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, rearranged, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases → exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases → n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, that's interesting. So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, no. Let me take an example. T increases, so 1/T decreases. So ΔE/(k T) becomes smaller, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller.

Yes, because as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller. For example, at higher T, the exponential term is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, that makes sense. Because higher T means more thermal energy, so more excitation to higher energy levels. So n2 increases relative to n1, so n1/n2 decreases.

So when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

In our problem, when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000 K) → n1/n2 is lower. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, no. Wait, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). According to our previous conclusion, a lower T would result in a higher n1/n2.

So when the star has no spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is lower than when it has spots (T=5500 K). Oh wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, that's conflicting with our earlier conclusion. Because according to the Boltzmann equation, lower T → higher n1/n2.

So if the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that implies that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. But according to Boltzmann, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So as T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases. So the ratio should increase when T decreases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. That's a contradiction.

So this suggests that perhaps I have a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about what is being observed.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But what about the spots themselves? Are the spots cooler or hotter than the surrounding photosphere? Well, spots are usually darker because they are cooler regions. So when spots cover part of the star's surface, the overall Teff of the entire photosphere goes down.

But in the photosphere itself, where the measurement is taken, does the temperature change? Or is the measurement done assuming LTE, but the overall star's Teff is lower because some regions are cooler (the spots) and others are normal (non-spots) at higher Teff.

Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the temperature is uniform in the photosphere (as per LTE assumption). No, wait, LTE assumes local thermal equilibrium, which doesn't necessarily mean the same T everywhere, but for each small region, the conditions are locally determined. But in this case, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the effective temperature of the entire star has decreased, implying that the average T is lower. But for the photosphere, maybe the spots are cooler regions, but the rest is hotter? Or perhaps not. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 5500 K is the effective temperature of the entire star, but the photosphere where the observations are made is at a higher temperature. Hmm, but the problem statement says that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think the photospheric T is 5500 K in that case.

Wait, but the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light, and its temperature is what we measure as Teff. So when the star's surface is partially covered by cooler spots, the overall Teff would be lower. So the average T of the photosphere is lower.

But the problem says that the photosphere is in LTE, but when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. So the temperature of the photosphere is now 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

So the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So when T is higher (6000 K), the exponent is smaller → exp(...) is smaller → n1/n2 is smaller.

When T is lower (5500 K), exponent is larger → exp(...) is larger → n1/n2 is larger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. The transition is 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet. I'm not sure, but that might correspond to a certain ionization potential or excitation energy.

Wait, the wavelength of the transition is given, which relates to the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

So, E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) → let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) e-15 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But energy in terms of per atom is often given in eV. So 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.372e-18 J = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a pretty high energy transition. So the energy difference ΔE between the two levels is about 8.56 eV.

Wow, that's a big energy difference. So that would mean that the transition is a high-energy (UV) transition, which makes sense with the wavelength given.

So ΔE = 8.56 eV.

Now, let's compute the exponent term for each temperature.

Let me compute ΔE/(k T) for both temperatures.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for T1 = 6000 K:

ΔE/(k T1) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) → 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 → approximately 0.517.

So 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.55.

Similarly, for T2 = 5500 K:

ΔE/(k T2) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500) → denominator is 8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.473935 → 8.56 / 0.473935 ≈ 18.07.

So the exponents are:

At T1: 16.55

At T2: 18.07

Wait, no, wait. Because in the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, so for T1=6000 K, R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(16.55)

For T2=5500 K, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(18.07)

So R1/R2 = exp(16.55) / exp(18.07) ) → exp(16.55 - 18.07) → exp(-1.52) ≈ 0.218.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So the ratio R (n1/n2) is lower when there are spots. So R2 < R1 → R1/R2 > 1. But according to this calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.218, which is less than 1. That's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Because when T decreases, ΔE/(kT) increases, so the exponent in R increases, so R increases. So R1 (T=6000) has a smaller exponent and thus R is smaller. R2 (T=5500) has a larger exponent and R is larger. So when the star has spots, R increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases. That's a contradiction. So perhaps I have the ratio reversed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n2/n1 instead. Let's see.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for T1=6000 K:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-16.55) → let's compute exp(-16.55) ≈ 1.3e-7.

For T2=5500 K:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-18.07) → exp(-18.07) ≈ 1.7e-8.

So R1 (n2/n1 at T1) is about 1.3e-7, R2 (n2/n1 at T2) is about 1.7e-8. So R2 is smaller than R1. So the ratio n2/n1 decreases when T decreases. Which matches the problem statement.

Ah, I see. So the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. But according to our earlier calculation, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) → when n2/n1 decreases, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think.

If R = n1/n2, then when n2/n1 decreases, R must increase because R's reciprocal is decreasing. So, if when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) is observed to decrease, that would imply that n2/n1 is increasing. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, for n2/n1 (which is (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T)) ), let's see.

Wait, as T decreases, -ΔE/(k T) becomes more negative. So exp of a more negative number is smaller. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) → as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, R = n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) → as n2/n1 decreases, R increases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, R =n1/n2 decreases. So this is a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier approach.

Wait, let's re-express everything.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So R2 < R1 → R1/R2 > 1.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500 K), R =n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)) → as T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases → exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases → R increases.

Which would mean R2 > R1, but the problem says R2 < R1. So the only way this makes sense is if the assumption is that when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere increases. But the problem says the opposite.

Wait, but the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K.

So the photosphere's effective temperature is lower when there are spots. So T decreases, which according to our calculation leads to R =n1/n2 increasing. But the problem says R decreases. So either the problem is incorrect, or I have a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the spots are hotter than the surrounding photosphere? But that's not usual. Spots are typically cooler. So when spots are present, the average Teff is lower. But perhaps the area of the star not covered by spots is hotter.

Wait, the problem says "when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K." Then, "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So the presence of spots reduces the overall Teff.

Thus, the photosphere's average T is lower when there are spots.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

At T=6000 K: R1 = (g1/g2) exp(16.55) = (g1/g2) * 1.3e7

At T=5500 K: R2 = (g1/g2) exp(18.07) = (g1/g2) * 5.9e7.

So R2 is much larger than R1. So R1/R2 = (1.3e7) / (5.9e7) ) ≈ 0.22. So the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Because when the star has spots, R2 is larger, so R =n1/n2 is larger when T is lower. But the problem says that R decreases when the star has spots.

Which is only possible if R is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2.

So perhaps the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1.

Wait, let's see.

If the ratio being considered is n2/n1, then:

At T=6000 K: R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -16.55 ) ≈ (g2/g1) * (some small number).

At T=5500 K: R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -18.07 ) → even smaller number.

So R2 < R1 → when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 decreases, which matches the problem statement.

So the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1, which is decreasing when the star has spots. So the ratio we're considering is n2/n1, and we need to find the factor R1/R2, which would be R1 (no spots) / R2 (spots) → which would be greater than 1, as R1 > R2.

So, R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -16.55 )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -18.07 )

R1/R2 = exp(18.07 -16.55) = exp(1.52) ≈ 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, option D is ~2.9, etc. So the factor is about 4.5. So the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels under the Boltzmann equation, which is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

where:
- \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the two energy levels,
- \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels,
- \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels,
- \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant,
- \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The problem states that the ratio \(n_1/n_2\) decreases when the star has spots. This implies that \(n_1/n_2\) is higher at \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and lower at \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots present).
2. The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. For \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\), the exponents in the Boltzmann factor are:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})T}.
   \]
   Substituting \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\), we find:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{kT} \big|_{T=6000} \approx 16.55, \quad \frac{\Delta E}{kT} \big|_{T=5500} \approx 18.07.
   \]

4. The ratio \(n_1/n_2\) at the two temperatures is:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} \big|_{T=6000} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp(16.55), \quad \frac{n_1}{n_2} \big|_{T=5500} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp(18.07).
   \]

5. The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT} \big|_{T=6000} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT} \big|_{T=5500}\right).
   \]
   Substituting the exponents:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}} = \exp(16.55 - 18.07) = \exp(-1.52) \approx 0.218.
   \]

6. Since the problem states that the ratio \(n_1/n_2\) decreases when the star has spots, the relevant factor is the inverse of the above result:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}} = \frac{1}{0.218} \approx 4.55.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
