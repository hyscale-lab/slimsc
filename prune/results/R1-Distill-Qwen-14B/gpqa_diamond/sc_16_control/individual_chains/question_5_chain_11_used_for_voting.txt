Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator components are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, so P is a vector operator, so the total operator would be P = P·n, which is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector n.

Since the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, that means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in the x-y plane it's (cosθ, sinθ, 0), but since it's in x-z, maybe it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis. Hmm, I might need to get that right.

Wait, the eigenvector is for the operator P in the direction n. So, the operator we're looking at is P·n, which is (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the first step is to write down the matrix form of P·n. Let's see, each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So for each component:

Px matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

And P_y is (ħ/2)* [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But since n is in x-z, n_y=0. So the operator we're interested in is P·n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

Let me compute the matrix for P·n. Let me denote n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is measured from the z-axis. Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ (from the positive z-axis) would have n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ, z = cosθ. But since φ is zero (as it's in x-z plane), x would be sinθ, z is cosθ. So yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's compute each part:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together, the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by ħ/2:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no. Wait, the addition is correct. So the combined matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

And then multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which means, (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let's write the matrix P·n - (ħ/2) I:

Each element of P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix elements, so subtract (ħ/2) I, which is a diagonal matrix with (ħ/2) on the diagonal.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the original matrix is M = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So M minus (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]  - (ħ/2) * I

= (ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

So the matrix elements are:

(ħ/2) [ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ]

We can factor out (ħ/2), so the equation is:

[ (cosθ -1)    sinθ      ] |a>   = 0
[   sinθ    (-cosθ -1)   ] |b>

Where |ψ> = [a; b]

So the system of equations is:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

But for eigenvalues, the determinant of the matrix (M - (ħ/2) I) should be zero. Wait, but we already have the eigenvalue, so we can proceed with the equations.

Looking at the two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Let me write equation 1 as:

a (cosθ -1) = - sinθ b
a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, let's substitute:

a = [ - [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] b

Simplify the negatives: numerator -2 sin... and denominator -2 sin²... so negatives cancel.

So:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] b

The 2's cancel, sin(theta/2) cancels with sin²:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b

= cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

But let's express this as a ratio. We can write a = [cot(theta/2)] b.

Alternatively, a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b

So let me write the vector components as [a; b] = [ cos(theta/2) * k , sin(theta/2) * k ] , where k is a normalization factor.

Wait, because a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] b → So if I set b = sin(theta/2) k, then a = cos(theta/2) k.

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2) k, sin(theta/2) k ].

Now, to normalize this vector, we compute the norm:

|k|^2 [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] = |k|^2 (1) → |k|=1.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check equation 2 to see if this holds.

Substitute a = cos(theta/2) k and b = sin(theta/2) k into equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substituting:
sinθ * cos(theta/2) k + (-cosθ -1) * sin(theta/2) k = 0

Simplify each term.

First term: sinθ cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) )= 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

Second term: (-cosθ -1) sin(theta/2) = - [ (1 + cosθ) ] sin(theta/2 )

But 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2)

So second term becomes: - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2 )

So equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) * k - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) * k = 0

Which simplifies to 0=0. So yes, it holds. So the solution is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but that's in the basis of the 2-component spinor. So the vector is (a, b) = (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))—so that's exactly our result.

Wait, but the options also have other things, like hbar and e^{i phi} terms. Hmm.

Wait, the eigenvectors are determined up to a phase. But in the options, option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar times cos(theta/2), and sqrt(1/3) hbar times sin(theta/2). Wait, but our solution doesn't have hbar factors because the eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, the problem statement says, "elements of the normalized eigenvector". So the options with hbar can't be correct, unless perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?

The eigenvector's elements should be dimensionless because they are coefficients in a quantum state, which is a normalized vector. So any option with ħ in the elements can't be correct. That rules out options A and D, which have ħ factors.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but our solution is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that doesn't match.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our solution.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the eigenvectors. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the operator.

Wait, the operator P·n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Let me write that again.

Each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

P_z = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

So let's compute that:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]

n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Multiply by ħ/2:

P·n = (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) n_z, (ħ/2) n_x ],
  [ (ħ/2) n_x, -(ħ/2) n_z ] ]

Ah wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the previous calculation, I thought the matrix was [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], but that's without the ħ/2 factor. Wait, no. Because when we write P·n, it's (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), and each P component is (ħ/2) times the respective matrix.

So the matrix for P·n is [[(n_z)(ħ/2), (n_x)(ħ/2)], [(n_x)(ħ/2), -(n_z)(ħ/2)]]

So when we set up the eigenvalue equation (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0,

the matrix becomes:

[ (n_z)(ħ/2) - (ħ/2), n_x (ħ/2)       ]
[ n_x (ħ/2),          -(n_z)(ħ/2) - (ħ/2) ]

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) * [ (n_z - 1) , n_x ]
          [ n_x , -(n_z + 1) ]

Wait, so each element is:

(ħ/2) (n_z - 1) → top left
(ħ/2) n_x → top right
(ħ/2) n_x → bottom left
(ħ/2) ( -n_z -1 ) → bottom right

So the equations are:

(ħ/2)(n_z -1) a + (ħ/2) n_x b = 0
(ħ/2) n_x a + (ħ/2)(-n_z -1) b = 0

We can factor out (ħ/2) from each equation, so it's sufficient to solve:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0   → equation 1
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → equation 2

So equation 1: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Let me express n_z and n_x in terms of theta.

Since n is in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So,

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1) to rationalize.

Wait, let's compute:

Denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(theta/2)

Numerator: - sinθ = -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

a = [ (-2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / (-2 sin^2(theta/2)) ] b

Simplify: the negatives cancel, 2 cancels, sin(theta/2) cancels.

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b

So, again, a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ]

Let me write this as:

b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

We can factor out cot(theta/2) to get:

b [1, tan(theta/2) ]

But to normalize, let's choose b such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Let me express the vector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me compute it:

Set b = sin(theta/2) → a = cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that's the same as before. So the normalized vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, let me make sure if the phase is an issue. The eigenvectors can have any phase, but the eigenvalue is positive, so perhaps the phases are as given.

Wait, but the problem statement says the operator lies along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector would depend on theta, but the form is as we found.

So the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (measured from the z-axis). The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Thus, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) | \psi \rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ gives:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ must satisfy:

\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \\
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, solving for $a$ gives:

\[
a = \frac{-\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} b.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]

after normalization. This matches the form of option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors.  
- **Option B** introduces $e^{i\phi}$, which is unnecessary for the eigenvector in this context.  
- **Option D** incorrectly includes $\hbar$ and additional factors that do not align with the derived solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
