Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a star with some dark spots and how they affect the observed brightness variations. The question is comparing this to the effect of an exoplanet transit, right? The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Alright, let me break it down. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is the same as R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, so 20% of one hemisphere is 10% of the entire star's surface? Wait, no, because one hemisphere is 50% of the surface. So if a hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%, that means the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So total spot area would be 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because a hemisphere is half the sphere. So 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². Or wait, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star covered. Oh, the question says "one hemisphere" is covered with a 20% filling factor. So 20% of the star's surface is covered? Or 20% of the hemisphere? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, 20% of that is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². So the total area covered is 0.1 π R².

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the filling factor refers to the entire star. So if 20% of the star is covered, regardless of the hemisphere. Hmm. Well, perhaps it's better to proceed with the given data.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler, I believe, since they're dark spots. The temperature difference is 1000K. So the spot temperature is 6000K - 1000K = 5000K? Or is it 6000 + 1000? No, dark spots are cooler, so 5000K.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out. So the brightness variation is due to the spots being on the side facing us. Since the spots are cooler, when they're on the front, the total flux drops. So the variation in brightness is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

But the question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So the change in brightness when the planet transits in front of the star is similar to the change caused by the spots. So we need to calculate the flux change due to the spots and compare it to the flux change due to a planet transit.

Wait, but the problem says that to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would do it. So we're to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

So first, let's compute the flux variation due to the spots.

The total flux from the star when spots are not visible is F0 = 4π Rstar² * sigma * Teff^4.

Wait, wait, no. The star's flux is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. But when part of the surface is cooler, the flux decreases.

The flux without any spots would be F0 = (L) / (4π D²), where D is the distance. But when the star is viewed, the observed flux depends on the area of the spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the fractional change in brightness.

The fractional change ΔF/F when the spots are present is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are present.

So, the normal flux is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (π Rstar²) / D², but actually, I think the correct approach is to compute the total flux as L/(4π), but perhaps a better way is to model the star as a blackbody with varying temperature over its surface.

Let me try to model this.

The star's total flux when spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the flux from the spots.

The unspotted part is (1 - filling factor) times the area, each part emitting at Teff.

Wait, but the filling factor here is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R².

Wait, no, because the star's surface area is 4π R². So the hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the total area of spots is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the problem says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So in the hemisphere, 20% is spots. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

So the rest of the hemisphere (80%) is normal, and the other hemisphere is completely normal. So the entire star's surface is 4π R². So the unspotted area is 4π R² - 0.4π R² = 3.6 π R².

Wait, no, wait. The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One has 20% of its area covered in spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2*(2π R²) = 0.4 π R². The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, so area 2π R².

So the total unspotted area is 2π R² + (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) = 3.6 π R². Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, no, the entire star's surface is 4π R². One hemisphere (2π R²) has 20% spots, so spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of the star (the other hemisphere and the unspotted part of the first) is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

So the flux when the spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the flux from the spots.

The flux from a surface area A at temperature T is A σ T^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible is:

F_spots_visible = (3.6 π R² σ Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (Teff - 1000 K)^4 )

Assuming that the spots are at 5000 K, since Teff is 6000 K and the difference is 1000 K.

Wait, no, maybe the difference is that the spot temperature is Teff - 1000 K, so 5000 K.

So the total flux is F_spots_visible = [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ].

The normal flux (when spots are not visible, i.e., when the spots are on the far side) is F_normal = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are not visible, we're seeing the entire star's surface except the spots, which are on the other side. Wait, no, if the spots are on the far side, they don't contribute to the flux. So the flux would be the entire star's surface minus the area of the spots. Wait, no, wait. When the spots are on the far side, the observed flux is from the entire unspotted area plus the spots on the far side don't contribute. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the flux variation when the spots are on the near side vs. when they're on the far side.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view. When the spots are on the side facing us, their cooler temperature will reduce the observed flux. When they're on the far side, their temperature doesn't affect the observed flux.

So the maximum dip occurs when the spots are fully visible. The average brightness without any spots would be F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

But wait, no. The actual average is when the spots are on the far side and not contributing. Because when the star rotates, the spots move from being on the near side to the far side. So the maximum flux is when all spots are on the far side, and the minimum flux is when all spots are on the near side.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is rotating, so the spots appear and disappear. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower. When they're on the far side, the flux is higher (since all the normal surface is visible). Hmm, but that's not correct because the spots are cool, so when they're on the near side, the flux is lower. When they're on the far side, the flux is higher than when spots are on the near side, but lower than if there were no spots at all?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's calculate the average flux and the variation.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_min = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

Wait, 4 π R² is the total surface. 0.4 π R² is the area of the spots. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_min = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

But wait, when the spots are on the far side, the flux would be F_max = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4. So the variation would be between F_min and F_max.

But the average brightness would be somewhere between these two, depending on the spot's visibility.

Wait, but the problem states that the star is observed, and because of rotation, the brightness varies periodically. The amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min.

Wait, no, the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min) / 2. Because the flux goes up and down by that amount around the average.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amplitude as the change in flux when the spots rotate into and out of view.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the change in flux when the spots are on the near side compared to when they're on the far side.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux divided by 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, but that's twice the amplitude. Hmmm.

Alternatively, the fractional change in flux (ΔF) is (F_min - F_max) / F0, or (F_max - F_min)/F0, depending on which is larger.

Wait, no. F_min is when spots are on the near side, so the flux is lower. F_max is when spots are on the far side, so the flux is higher than F_min but perhaps lower than F0? Wait, no, if the star is unspotted, it would be F0. But if spots are on the far side, the flux is F_max = (4 π R² σ (6000^4)) - (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4)) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000^4))? No, that doesn't make sense. Because when the spots are on the far side, their flux doesn't contribute to the observed flux. So F_max in that case would be the flux from the entire star without spots, which is F0. Because when the spots are on the far side, we don't see them. So the flux is F0.

Wait, but that would mean that F_max is F0, and F_min is when the spots are on the near side, so F_min = F0 - (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)).

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to think. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is reduced by the amount that the spots contribute less than the surrounding areas.

So the flux without any spots is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

The flux when the spots are on the near side: F_min = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

Which is F_min = (3.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the difference between F0 and F_min is:

ΔF = F0 - F_min = [4 π R² σ (6000)^4] - [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4]

= (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)).

So the fractional change is (ΔF) / F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / [4 π R² σ (6000^4)]

Simplify:

= (0.4) (6000^4 - 5000^4) / (4 * 6000^4)

= (0.1) (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 is about 0.694, squared again is about 0.482.

So 1 - 0.482 = 0.518.

So fractional change ≈ 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518, about 5.18%.

Wait, but this is the fractional change when the spots are on the near side. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be about 5.18% of the star's flux.

Wait, but the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. Or is it the maximum dip?

Wait, when the star is rotating, the brightness goes from F0 (when spots are on the far side, not visible) to F_min (spots on the near side). So the maximum dip is F0 - F_min = ΔF = 0.0518 F0. So the amplitude of the light curve (the depth) is ~5.18%.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the observed flux is lower by ΔF. So the maximum dip is ΔF / F0, which is about 5.18%.

Now, the problem states that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So we need to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits the star.

The dip in brightness when a planet transits is given by the formula:

ΔF_planet = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the area blocked is π R_planet², and the star's area is π R_star². So the fractional change is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, but that's when the planet blocks the light from the star. So the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So if the dip caused by the planet is equal to the dip caused by the spots, then:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.0518.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the calculation of the fractional change due to the spots is 5.18%, which is about 0.0518. So the dip is 5.18%, which is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

So,

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.0518.

Take square root:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option isn't here. Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.2276 is approximately 0.23. None of the options match. So perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, the area of the spots: 20% of one hemisphere. Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The total flux when spots are on the near side: (3.6 π R²)*σ*(6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ*(5000)^4.

The total flux when spots are on the far side: 4 π R² * σ * (6000)^4. Because all the star's surface is contributing except the spots, but wait no, when the spots are on the far side, the observed flux is the same as F0, right? Because all the star's surface is contributing except the spots, which are not seen. So the flux is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the far side, their flux doesn't contribute, but the rest of the star (which is 4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) contributes. But wait, the entire star is 4 π R². When the spots are on the far side, the part of the star we see is 4 π R² - 0.4 π R², and the spots (0.4 π R²) are on the other side. But no, when the star is observed, we see the entire star's surface except for the spots that are on the far side. No, that's not correct. Wait, the star is a sphere. The spots are on the far side, so we don't see them. So the observed flux is from the unspotted areas on the near side.

Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the observed flux is lower because part of the near side (0.4 π R²) is at a lower temperature. When the spots are on the far side, the observed flux is the same as if the star had no spots on the near side, so the flux is higher than when spots are on the near side.

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the change in flux when the spots are on the near side.

The difference in flux is the amount by which the spots reduce the total flux when they're on the near side.

So,

ΔF = (Flux without spots) - (Flux with spots on near side)

= [4 π R² σ (6000^4)] - [ (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) ]

= [4 π R² σ (6000^4)] - [3.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)]

= [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) ] - [0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

So the fractional change is:

ΔF / F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

= (0.4 / 4) * (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4

= 0.1 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As before.

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747, which is about 5.177%.

So the dip is approximately 5.18% of the star's flux.

So the planet would have to cause the same dip.

The dip due to a planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So,

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.05177.

Take square root: R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276, which is approximately 0.23.

But the options given don't have 0.23. The closest is option C) ~0.11, which is about 0.11, and option D) ~0.32.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flux from the star when the spots are on the near side, and then compare it to the flux when the spots are on the far side (i.e., when the spots are not contributing to the flux).

So the maximum flux (F_max) is when the spots are on the far side, and the flux is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

The minimum flux (F_min) is when the spots are on the near side, so:

F_min = (3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4).

So the dip is F_max - F_min = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4 - [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4]

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4].

So the dip is ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

The fractional dip is ΔF / F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 π R² σ (6000^4)]

= (0.4 /4) * (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4

= 0.1 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Same as before, about 5.18%.

So the problem states that this dip is the same as that caused by an exoplanet. So the exoplanet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots are only on the near side half the time, and not the other. Wait, no, when the star is observed, the spots are on the near side for a certain period, but the question says the brightness shows periodic variations due to rotational modulation. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully on the near side.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation should consider the maximum change in flux, which is when all the spotted area is on the near side. So the dip is indeed 5.18%.

Wait, but if the options don't have 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is 0.833333.

0.8333^2 is 0.694444.

0.694444^2 is approximately 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 is 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747, so 5.177%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

Which is approximately 0.23, but again, the options don't have this.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2 = 0.152 → 15.2%, which is way higher than 5.18%.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49%, too small.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21%, nope.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24%, no.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the flux when the spots are on the near side. Because the spots are cooler, so the flux from them is less than the surrounding areas.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the flux when the spots are on the near side, and when they are not (on the far side), then the difference is the dip.

So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_min = F_unspotted - F_spotted + F_cooled.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Alternatively, perhaps the average flux is F_avg = F0 * (1 - (filling factor) * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 )).

Wait, no, that's a different approach. Let me think.

The total flux from the star when spots are present on the near side is:

F = (1 - filling factor) * T_eff^4 * π R² + filling factor * T_spot^4 * π R².

Wait, but that's for a single hemisphere. So no, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Flux = (1 - f) * T_eff^4 * A + f * T_spot^4 * A,

where f is the filling factor of the hemisphere, and A is the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, but the area of the hemisphere is 2π R², so the total area is 4π R².

Hmm, maybe this approach is complicating things. Let me think of the star as having a certain area with a lower temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the fluxes when the spots are present and when they're not.

But perhaps I should use the formula for the change in flux:

ΔF = (F_spotted - F_unspotted).

Wait, but F_unspotted is when the spots are on the far side, so F_unspotted = F0.

F_spotted = F when spots are on the near side.

So,

ΔF = F0 - F_spotted.

Which is the same as before, giving a dip of about 5.18%.

So the planet's radius would need to cause a dip of 5.18%, which requires (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.0518 → R_planet ≈ 0.2276 R_star.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

But wait, what if the spots are hotter? No, dark spots imply cooler regions.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. Let me try that.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then the area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

So then,

F_spotted = (4π R² - 0.8 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.8 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

ΔF = F0 - F_spotted = [4 π R² σ (6000^4)] - [3.2 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.8 π R² σ (5000^4) ]

= (0.8 π R² σ (6000^4)) - (0.8 π R² σ (5000^4))

= 0.8 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4].

ΔF / F0 = (0.8 /4) * [ (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4 ] 

= 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

Which is 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355, so 10.35% dip.

Then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 R_star. So about 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is for the hemisphere. So 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered in spots. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², as I initially thought.

But then in that case, the dip is 5.18%, which doesn't match any options.

But if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, the area is 0.8 π R², leading to a dip of ~10.35%, which would correspond to a planet radius of ~0.32 Rstar, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, even though it says one hemisphere. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the filling factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is not 20% of the hemisphere, but 20% of the star's surface. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the hemisphere is covered in spots, and the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the earlier calculation holds, leading to a dip of ~5.18%, which corresponds to a planet radius of ~0.23 Rstar, which isn't an option.

Hmm. This suggests that perhaps the problem treats the filling factor as the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. So the area is 20% of 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

So then the dip would be 10.35%, and the planet radius would be ~0.32 Rstar, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the star is observed, only one hemisphere is spotty, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is on the near side.

Wait, but the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and the spots are on one hemisphere, which is 2π R². So when the star rotates, the spots are either on the near side (covering 2π R²) or on the far side (not visible). So the maximum dip would be when the entire 2π R² of spots is on the near side.

Wait, this is a different approach. So earlier I considered the area of spots as 0.4 π R². But perhaps the spots cover the entire hemisphere, so area 2π R².

Wait, no, the problem states the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But perhaps the problem is considering that the entire hemisphere is covered with spots (filling factor 100%), but the problem says 20% filling factor.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the entire star's surface is covered. So area is 0.2 *4 π R²=0.8 π R².

In that case, the dip would be 10.35%, leading to a planet radius of ~0.32 Rstar, which is option D.

But the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the correct area is 0.4 π R².

But then, without any of the options matching 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should involve the ratio of the areas, but considering the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the dip in flux is (A_spot / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ).

Wait, let's think about it. The spots have an area A_spot, and each spot contributes less flux. So the total flux is F = F_normal - (A_spot / A_star) * (F_normal_per_area - F_spot_per_area).

So F = F_normal - (A_spot / A_star) * (σ T_eff^4 - σ (Teff - 1000)^4 )

= F_normal [1 - (A_spot / A_star) * (1 - (Teff-1000)/Teff)^4 ) ]

So the fractional dip is ΔF/F = (A_spot / A_star) * [1 - (Teff-1000)/Teff)^4 ]

Which is the same as (0.2) * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Wait, because A_spot is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So A_spot / A_star = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

So,

ΔF/F = 0.1 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177 → 5.177%.

Which brings us back again to the same 5.177% dip.

So the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore the temperature difference, and assume the spots are black (T=0). But that doesn't make sense, because the problem states a temperature difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So A_spot = 0.2 *4 π R²=0.8 π R².

So,

ΔF/F = (0.8 π R² / 4 π R²) * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ] = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.10354 → 10.35%.

So R_planet^2 = 0.10354 → R_planet ≈ 0.3217 Rstar → ~0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the question intended that the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Therefore, the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Temperature of the spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness varies due to rotational modulation as the spots rotate into and out of view.
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is determined by the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

### Step 1: Area of the Spots
The problem states that the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. The surface area of a hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area of the spots is:
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2
\]

### Step 2: Fractional Brightness Variation
The fractional change in brightness (\( \Delta F / F_0 \)) when the spots are on the near side is given by:
\[
\Delta F / F_0 = \left( \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} \right) \times \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]
- \( A_{\text{star}} = 4\pi R^2 \), so \( \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1 \).
- \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \), and \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482 \).
- Substituting:
\[
\Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \times \left( 1 - 0.482 \right) = 0.1 \times 0.518 = 0.0518 \, \text{(or 5.18%)}.
\]

### Step 3: Exoplanet Radius for the Same Brightness Variation
The brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet is given by:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} / F_0 = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
Equating this to the brightness variation caused by the spots:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.0518
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.2276
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the Options
The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor is interpreted as 20% of the **entire star's surface** (instead of just one hemisphere), the area of the spots becomes:
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4\pi R^2 = 0.8\pi R^2
\]
Recomputing the fractional brightness variation:
\[
\frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.8\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.2
\]
\[
\Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \times \left( 1 - 0.482 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.518 = 0.1036 \, \text{(or 10.36%)}.
\]
For the exoplanet:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
\]
This matches **option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion
The problem likely assumes the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet that produces the same brightness variation is approximately \( 0.32 R_{\text{star}} \).
