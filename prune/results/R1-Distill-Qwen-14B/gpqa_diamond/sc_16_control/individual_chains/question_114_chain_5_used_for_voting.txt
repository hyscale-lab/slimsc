Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is between butan-2-one and sodium cyanide (NaCN) with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents from the given options.

First, let's break down the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, when a ketone reacts with a nitrile source, like NaCN, what usually happens? I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, a ketone can undergo a nucleophilic addition. But wait, adding NaCN to a ketone... Oh right, that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, and then gets protonated. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize that.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and the hydroxyl group comes from the acid work-up, I think. So the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. So reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid). So option A or B for part A.

Wait, but what about the role of NaCN here? NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But since it's a strong base, maybe it's in a basic condition, but the work-up would involve acid. Oh, wait, no: adding NaCN to a ketone under acidic conditions. Because the reaction involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better electrophile, then the CN- attacks.

So for the first step, the reaction is a hydrocyanation or cyanohydrin formation. The typical reagent is HCN, but in this case, NaCN is used, which in an acidic condition would form HCN. So the first reaction needs an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. That's usually used in other reactions, like the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols, maybe in the presence of sulfites. But in this case, we're forming a cyanohydrin. So I think A is H3O+.

So for the first part, the correct A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be converted to carboxylic acids through hydrolysis. The typical conditions involve either strong acid or strong base. When using acidic conditions, it's often H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) as a catalyst, and heating with water. Or another strong acid.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be using HCl as the reagent. Or is it another acid?

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent B is used with water. So B is likely an acid or a base that facilitates the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can occur under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think about each.

In acidic conditions, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used. In basic conditions, using NaOH and heating, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylate, which can then be acidified to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, reagent B is used with water. So, the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid) in options A and D, or HCl and CH3COOH in others.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So, if the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions, you would need a strong acid. HCl is a strong acid. Alternatively, if it's done under basic conditions, you'd have a base, but then you might need an acid work-up to get the carboxylic acid.

But in the second reaction, the reagent B is given as part of the reaction, along with water. So if it's HCl, that's a strong acid, which would protonate the nitrile group, facilitating the hydrolysis. Or, maybe the reaction uses a strong acid as B.

Wait, but another possibility is the use of H2SO4. But in the options, we don't see H2SO4. The options for B are HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, in one of the options for B, it's HCl (option A) or HCl (D?), wait let me check:

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So B can be HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, what's the process for nitrile to carboxylic acid? The hydrolysis of nitriles (RCN + H2O) under strong acidic conditions gives RCOOH. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it gives RCOO^- Na+ which then acidified gives RCOOH.

So, if reagent B is HCl, adding HCl in water would give an acidic condition, which would facilitate the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

But wait, but sometimes acetic acid is used as a catalyst, but I'm not sure if that's sufficient for the hydrolysis of nitriles. Because nitrile hydrolysis typically requires a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. Acetic acid is a weak acid; perhaps it's not strong enough for that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a hydrolysis under basic conditions. But in that case, B would be a base, but in the options, the choices are HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O. So, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. So, if B is HCl, then the mixture would be HCl and water. That would make sense.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, perhaps the reaction is done in a buffered condition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction produces a cyanohydrin, which is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. Then, the second reaction converts the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

So, the second reaction is nitrile to acid. So, the conditions should be acidic, because in the presence of an acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid.

So, reagent B should be an acid. In the options, B could be HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

But CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be strong enough to hydrolyze nitriles? I'm not sure. I think HCl is a stronger acid and would be more effective in this hydrolysis.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis can be done using H3O+ (like sulfuric acid) as the catalyst, but in the options, for B, only HCl and acetic acid are given.

So, if for the second reaction, B is HCl (option A: B=HCl), that would make sense. Because HCl is a strong acid.

Alternatively, if the reaction uses a weak acid, that might not be enough. So, I think B is HCl.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction uses A = H3O+. The second reaction uses B. The options are A, B, C, D.

If the correct option is A, then A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Let me check the options.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

If the second reaction needs HCl, then option A would be correct. But I need to confirm.

Wait, let me think about the reagents in the options again. The first reagent is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The second reagent is either HCl, CH3COOH.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm not sure how that would fit. Sodium bisulfite is often used in the production of sulfites in the reduction of carbonyl groups. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a reagent. But in this case, the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which I think occurs under acidic conditions, so A is H3O+.

So, the second reaction: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (from the first step) or the other compound is reacting. Wait, the second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, it's a nitrile group attached to a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, so the nitrile (CN) becomes COOH. So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So, the reaction is RCN → RCOOH. How is this done? One method is hydrolysis, either under acidic or basic conditions.

In acidic conditions, you can use H2SO4, HCl, or other strong acids. In basic conditions, you use NaOH or another strong base.

So, if the reaction is done in acidic conditions, perhaps using HCl as B, which is an option.

So, the correct B would be HCl, making option A the correct choice (A=H3O+, B=HCl).

Wait, but looking back, in the first reaction, the reagent is A, which is H3O+ or NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, A has to be H3O+ because NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^-.

But wait, another thought: maybe the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid. Wait, no. NaHSO3 is a weak acid, but in solution, it can act as an acid. Wait, but in an aqueous solution, NaHSO3 would produce H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, but the cyanohydrin formation typically requires a strong acid as a catalyst. So, H3O+ (like H2SO4) is a stronger acid than NaHSO3.

So, for the first reaction, A should be H3O+.

So, looking back at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So, the correct option for A is H3O+, so options A and B are in the running.

Now, for the second reaction's reagent B. If the second reaction uses HCl (option A), then the choice would be option A.

But wait, let me think more about the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is R-C(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3 perhaps. When you hydrolyze the CN group, you get R-C(OH)(COOH)-CH2CH3. But wait, no, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Let me think about the structure.

Butanoic acid has four carbons. The product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, so the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2COOH? Wait, no, but I'm a bit confused. Let me correct.

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is (PhCH2C6H4)-C(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, but I think focusing on the reaction type is better. So, nitrile to carboxylic acid. So, the reaction is:

RCN + H2O → RCOOH

Which requires either H+ (acid) or OH- (base) as a catalyst.

In the options, B is HCl or acetic acid.

If B is HCl, it's a strong acid, which would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid.

If B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), it's a weak acid. Maybe it's not strong enough. So, I think B is HCl, making option A correct.

So, the first reagent is H3O+ (A), the second is HCl (B). So, option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another possibility: maybe the second reaction uses H2O along with some acid. So, H2O is the solvent, and B is the acid. So, in option A, B is HCl, which would be the acid in the reaction.

Alternatively, if the reaction uses HCl as the acid, then heating with water would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. That makes sense.

So, putting it all together: reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and reagent B is HCl (so option A).

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acidic catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** is the appropriate reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile-to-carboxylic-acid hydrolysis reaction. Such reactions typically require strong acidic or basic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is a strong acid and would effectively facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid. While acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is also an acid, it is a weak acid and may not be strong enough for this reaction.

From the analysis:
- For Reaction 1, the correct reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.
- For Reaction 2, the correct reagent B is **HCl**.

Thus, the correct option is **A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
