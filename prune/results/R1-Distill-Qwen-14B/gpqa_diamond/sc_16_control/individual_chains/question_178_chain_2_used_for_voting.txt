Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is important for determining renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have couplings with mass dimension ≥ 0, I think. Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Let me get this straight.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4, because in four spacetime dimensions, each term in the action (which is ∫d^4x L) must be dimensionless. So each term in L has dimension [L] = 4.

So breaking down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}:

Each ψ (fermion field) has mass dimension 3/2. Because for Dirac spinors, ψ has dimension (d-1)/2 when d is spacetime dimensions. Since this is 4D, (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2.

σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices, right? Because σ is antisymmetric and made from the commutator of γ's. The γ matrices are dimensionless, I think. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as the product of two γ's, but since they're matrices, their structure doesn't affect the mass dimension. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. For electromagnetism, the field strength F_{μν} has dimensions [mass]^2. Because the field tensor is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A (the gauge field) has dimension 1. So each derivative ∂μ brings a mass dimension of 1, and since F is built from two derivatives, its dimension is 2.

Putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (3/2) times σ_{μν} (0) times ψ (3/2) times F^{μν} (2). So the dimensions add up as:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]
= [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2
= [κ] + (3/2 + 3/2) + 2
= [κ] + 3 + 2
= [κ] +5.

And since the entire term must have dimension 4 (because it's part of the Lagrangian), we set [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizable theories require the coupling constants to have mass dimension ≤ (d-4) for a theory in d dimensions. Wait, no, wait: the general rule is that a coupling in a renormalizable interaction term must have mass dimension ≤ d - (sum of fields' dimensions). Or perhaps it's that the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: In four dimensions, operators in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension ≤4. But for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥0, because otherwise the interaction becomes relevant (and the theory is non-renormalizable). Wait, no, wait: no, the dimension of the coupling determines whether the interaction is relevant, marginal, or irrelevant. For renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0 because higher-dimensional operators (with negative mass dimension) would make the theory non-renormalizable, as they have to be multiplied by some cutoff scale.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of superficial degree of divergence. For a term in the Lagrangian, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (n_p - n_f * (d-1)/2), where n_p is the number of bosonic fields and n_f the number of fermionic fields. But in our case, the term is an interaction term with coupling κ.

But wait, perhaps another approach: the interaction term is of the form κ (ψ̄ σ F ψ). Let's see the dimension of the interaction term.

Wait, each ψ is dimension 3/2, so two ψs make 3. The F has dimension 2. So the term without κ is (3 +2) =5. Adding κ, which is dimension -1, makes the whole term dimension 4, which is correct for a Lagrangian.

But the dimension of the coupling is [κ] = -1. So in four dimensions, the dimension of the coupling is negative. For a renormalizable theory, all couplings must have dimension ≥0. Because if the coupling has dimension negative, say [g] = -d, then each time you have a vertex with g, it's bringing a factor of Λ^d (where Λ is a high-energy scale), which can lead to the theory being non-renormalizable because you can’t absorb all the infinities with a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, wait, in four dimensions, a coupling with dimension [g] = 0 is marginal, [g]>0 is irrelevant, and [g] <0 is relevant. But for renormalizability, the coupling must have dimensions ≥0 because non-renormalizable theories have couplings with negative mass dimension, which would imply that the interaction becomes strong at low energies (so you need an effective theory).

So in our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait again. Are there other factors here? The interaction is between spinor fields and a field strength tensor. But perhaps the gauge field A is involved? No, in the given Lagrangian, it's the field strength F that appears, which is built from A and its derivatives, so the A field's dimension is 1. But in this term, it's F that is part of the interaction.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, which is less than zero. That means the theory is non-renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. Hmm, no, because [κ] is -1, which is non-renormalizable. So A is no.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. No, because our calculation says [κ]=-1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. That matches.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension $[L]_M = 4$ to ensure the action is dimensionless. Breaking down the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$:

- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from $\gamma$ matrices, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

Adding these dimensions:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = [\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa]_M + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term must have $[L]_M = 4$, we solve:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions, $[g]_M \geq 0$. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This implies the theory is **not renormalizable**, as interactions with negative mass dimension typically require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is not 1.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, matches the analysis.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
