Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I'll read the question carefully.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think that's a typo in the expression. Maybe it's supposed to be something like L = -λ X ψ̄ ψ, but I'll proceed with the given info.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing possible decay channels.

So, first, I remember that for a particle to decay into another, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the daughter particles. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the parent is at least as much as the sum of the rest masses of the daughters.

So the key here is to determine which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because X is 6 GeV, so each daughter can be at most 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The boson X is interacting with fermions, so the decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into pairs like ff̄, where f is a fermion.

So what fermions are light enough that their mass is less than 3 GeV? Let's list the known fermion masses.

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So, looking at these, any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but X has a mass of 6 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must be at most 3 GeV because 2*3 =6. So let's see which are allowed.

For quarks, the mass is m_quark. But wait, when considering decay into quarks, we have to account for the fact that in a decay, the quarks hadronize, but for kinematically allowed decays, we just consider whether the mass is less than half of X's mass.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, when a particle decays into quarks, the quarks are considered as free particles, but since they are confined, the decay products are actually hadrons. However, the question is about the possible decay channels based on mass and coupling.

But wait the interaction Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe that's written as L = -λ (v + X) ψ̄ ψ? Or maybe I'm misreading it. Let me parse the given expression again.

The interaction term seems to be λ times f (maybe a Yukawa coupling term?), times ψ̄, (v + X), ψ. Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ (v + X) ψ̄ ψ. So the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ.

So the coupling is between X and fermions ψ. So X can decay into ψ and anti-ψ.

So the possible decay channels are X → ψ ψ̄. So the question is which fermions ψ are allowed given X's mass.

So the mass of each ψ must be less than or equal to 3 GeV because X is 6 GeV, and each ψ would need to be less than or equal to 3 GeV to have a total mass of up to 6 GeV. Wait, no, because when you have a particle of mass M decaying into two particles each of mass m, the condition is M ≥ 2m. So each m must be ≤ M/2. So 6/2=3 GeV.

So which fermions have m ≤3 GeV? Let's see.

Quarks:

- u: ~2.2 MeV → okay
- d: ~4.7 MeV → okay
- s: ~95 MeV → okay
- c: ~1.3 GeV → 1.3 <3 → okay
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → not allowed
- t: 173 GeV → way too big.

Leptons:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → okay
- μ: 0.105 GeV → okay
- τ: 1.78 GeV → 1.78 <3 → okay.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Wait, but wait, the decay would produce a pair of these fermions. So the possible decay channels are X → ff̄ for each allowed f.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b's. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-

This includes c, s, u, d, τ, mu, e. All their masses are under 3 GeV. So this looks possible.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

But t is top quark, mass 173 GeV, way too big. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Again, includes b which is too heavy.

Wait, wait, but wait. I thought X can't decay into b's. So looking at the options, only option B and possibly another are correct. Let's check.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All their masses are under 3 GeV, so X can decay into any of these pairs.

Options A and D include b, which is 4.5 GeV. So their decay into b b̄ is not allowed because 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So these options are incorrect.

So the correct decay channels are the ones in option B.

Wait, but what about the tau? Its mass is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3, so allowed.

Wait, but wait another point: is the X allowed to couple to all these fermions? The Lagrangian given is L = -λ (v+X) ψ̄ ψ. So the interaction is between X and any fermion ψ, provided that ψ is present in the model. So if the model includes all these fermions, then yes, X can decay into any of them.

So the allowed decays are all the fermion pairs where the fermion mass is ≤3 GeV. So the correct option is B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y).
\]

This indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f\bar{f} \)) if the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). For a particle of mass \( M \), the decay into two particles of mass \( m \) is kinematically allowed if \( M \geq 2m \). Since \( X \) has a mass of 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay pair must satisfy \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses
- **Quarks**:  
  - \( u \): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 4.5 > 3 \))  
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 173 > 3 \))  

- **Leptons**:  
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)  

From this, the allowed fermions for \( X \)-boson decay are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \), as their masses are all less than or equal to 3 GeV.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( b \) quark mass (\( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV, so this is correct.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since the \( t \)-quark mass (\( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) is far greater than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the \( X \)-boson.
