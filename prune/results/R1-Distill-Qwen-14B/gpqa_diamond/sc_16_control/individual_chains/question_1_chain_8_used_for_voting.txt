Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a quantum state simultaneously. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time (which is related to the lifetime) has to be at least ħ/2.

But wait, in this problem, the lifetimes are given as the actual lifetimes of the states. So, I think the uncertainty in time (Δt) would be related to the lifetime τ. Maybe Δt is approximately τ? Or perhaps it's half the lifetime, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed and see.

The idea is that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for the two states to be distinguishable. So, if the energy difference ΔE is much larger than the uncertainty in energy (ΔE > ΔE_uncertainty), then we can resolve them. But if ΔE is too small, the uncertainty might blur the two states into each other, making them indistinguishable.

So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) would be ħ/(2τ). Because the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/ (2Δt), and Δt is the uncertainty in time, which is the lifetime τ. Or maybe I should think it's ħ/τ because some sources might use Δt as the full τ. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so if Δt is the lifetime τ, then ΔE ≥ ħ/(2 τ). So the minimum energy uncertainty is ħ/(2 τ).

But wait, another approach: the energy uncertainty relates to the linewidth in spectroscopy. The natural linewidth is proportional to 1/τ. So, the width (ΔE) is ħ/τ. Maybe some sources double it, but generally, it's ħ/τ. So perhaps I should use ΔE = ħ/τ as the uncertainty.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But the problem gives the energy difference options in eV, so I need to convert units.

Let me compute the uncertainty for each state.

For the first state, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert J to eV, since 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so ΔE1 (eV) = (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ approx 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, 1e-25 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-6, so 1e-6 * 1.05e-34/1.6e-19? Wait wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 s: that's 1.05457e-25 J. Then, 1.05457e-25 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV. Let me compute 1.05457 / 1.602 ≈ 0.658. So, 0.658e-6 eV, which is 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly for the second state, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05457e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J. Then, 1.05457e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV. Again, 0.658 * 1e-7 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but since the problem is about the energy difference between the two states, we have to consider the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty is the larger of the two. Because if one state has a larger spread, then their energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to be resolved.

Wait, maybe. Because if E1 is uncertain by ΔE1, and E2 is uncertain by ΔE2, then for E2 - E1 to be distinguishable, their difference must be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the difference is less than the sum, the uncertainty might overlap, making them appear the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the lifetime of the state relates to the lifetime of the energy measurement. So, if the states have different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties are different.

Hmm. Let me think: The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So when considering the difference between E2 and E1, the uncertainty in that difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, right? Because Δ(E2 - E1) = ΔE2 + ΔE1. So to resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, but in some contexts, the energy difference's uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties. So, let's calculate that.

So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

E2, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Because τ2 is 1e-8, so ΔE2 is 1e-8 s: 1.05457e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J. Converted to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 6.58e-8 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let's compute that sum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = (6.58 + 0.658) e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, which one is larger than this?

Options:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 0.000001 eV → way smaller than 7.24e-7 eV.
B) 1e-11 eV → 0.000000001 eV → nope.
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger than 7.24e-7. So yes, this would work.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than 7.24e-7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The required ΔE is about 7.24e-7 eV. So any option above that is acceptable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 10,000e-8, which is way bigger than 7.24e-7. So yes, option C would allow clear distinction.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 1e-4 eV is 100 microelectronvolts, which is a lot. I mean, in many experiments, energy differences in the order of microvolts can be resolved.

But perhaps I should reconsider. Maybe I'm supposed to take the minimum uncertainty, not the sum. Let me think again.

The energy difference's uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. So to clearly distinguish, the measured ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state.

So, if the actual energy difference is larger than the sum, then you can tell them apart.

But in the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says 'energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved'. So the other way: the energy resolution needed is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. So if the difference is larger than that sum, you can distinguish.

So for the options, the only option that's larger than 7.24e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV = 1e-4, which is 1e4 * 1e-8, which is 1e4 times larger than 7.24e-7. So yes, that would work.

But wait, what if the question is considering each state's uncertainty separately, and perhaps the energy difference should be greater than each individual uncertainty?

Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum. Let's think: If E1 has uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 has uncertainty ΔE2, then the uncertainty in E2-E1 would be ΔE2 + ΔE1.

Alternatively, if the two states have an energy difference of ΔE, and each has an uncertainty, then for the two to be resolvable, ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

So, in our case, the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. Only option C is bigger than that.

Wait, but looking back, I think I may have an error in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the energy uncertainties.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. I remember that ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s.

Ah, that's a useful number. So using that, perhaps I should compute the energy uncertainties in eV.

Yes, that's a better approach. So for state 1, τ1=1e-9 sec.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, τ2=1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 (ΔE) must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 1e-9, which is 0.001e-6. That's way smaller than 7.24e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller than A. No.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV. That is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7.24e-7 (which is 0.724e-6). So yes, option C is bigger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV. That's also smaller than 7.24e-7 eV.

So the only option that works is option C.

Wait, but wait, what if the question is considering the energy difference as the absolute value. Because sometimes, energy differences are given as E2 - E1, which is positive, but the uncertainty is about the same as the sum.

So yes, the conclusion is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is bounded by:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For the first state (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state (\( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the total uncertainty in the energy difference
The energy difference between the two states, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \), must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties to ensure the states are distinguishable:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C**.
