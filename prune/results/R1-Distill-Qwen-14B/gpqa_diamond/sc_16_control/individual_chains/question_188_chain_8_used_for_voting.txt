Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance and the angles of the rhombohedral crystal, and asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, right? In a crystal structure, it's the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of hexagonal crystal system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The lattice parameters here are all a, b, c, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles α, β, γ are all equal. Oh wait, in this case, they've given α=β=γ=30 degrees, so it's a primitive rhombohedral crystal.

The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So that's the edge length of the unit cell? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', the edge length. But rhombohedral has all edges equal, so 'a' here is 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula from the Bragg's Law context, involving the Miller indices.

Wait, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) )

Wait, no, wait. Because in a general triclinic system, the formula is more complicated. For a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, so the cross terms go away. But in a rhombohedral system, the angles are 30 degrees here, so we have to consider the cos terms.

So the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα )) ]^(-1/2) 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is actually:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, but wait. Because I'm a bit confused between different systems. Let me double-check. For a cubic system, when all angles are 90 degrees, then cos terms are zero, and the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But for other systems, the angles matter.

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, α=β=γ=θ. So perhaps I can substitute that into the formula.

In this case, h=1, k=1, l=1. So the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2( (1*1 cosθ) + (1*1 cosθ) + (1*1 cosθ) ) )

Simplify that: the numerator is 3, and the denominator inside the sqrt has 3 + 2*(3 cosθ), since each term is cosθ and there are three terms like hk, hl, kl. So 3 + 6 cosθ.

Wait, wait, let's compute that step by step.

Let me write the general form again. The denominator inside the square root is:

h² +k² + l² + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα)

Since in our case, h=k=l=1, and α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So substituting:

h² + k² + l² = 1 +1+1 =3.

The next part: 2*(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα)

Each term is 1*1 cos(30), so each term is cos(30°). There are three terms: hk, hl, kl. So each product is 1, so each term is cos(30).

So the sum inside the 2*( ) becomes 3 * cos(30°). Multiply by 2: 6 * cos(30°).

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 + 6 cos(30°).

Compute cos(30°): it's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196)

What's sqrt(8.196)?

Let me compute sqrt(8.196). Well, 9 squared is 81, so sqrt(81)=9, but wait, 8.196 is about 8.196. Let me compute:

sqrt(8.196) = approximately sqrt(8.196) = around 2.863.

Wait, wait, 2.863^2 = 8.196? Let me compute:

2.863 * 2.863 = (2.8)^2 is 7.84, 0.063^2 is ~0.0039, and cross terms 2*(2.8)(0.063)≈0.3528. So 7.84 + 0.3528 +0.0039≈8.1967. Yes, so sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

Given a is 10 Angstroms.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the options are about 9 Angstroms. Hmm, what did I do wrong here?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think I messed up somewhere. Because the interplanar distance for (111) in a cubic system with a=10 would be 10/sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstroms, but here the angles are 30 degrees, so the interplanar distance should be longer or shorter?

Wait, cos(30) is positive, so in the formula, the denominator inside the sqrt increases, making d smaller. Because in the denominator, the sqrt would be larger, so d would be smaller than in the cubic case.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstroms, which is larger than 10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

So with a=10, and angles 30 degrees, and hkl=111.

So putting the numbers in:

h² +k² + l² =3.

2*(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) = 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 +1*1 * cos30 )

= 2*(3 * (√3/2)) )= 2*(3*(0.8660))=2*(2.598)≈5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstroms. But that's way smaller than 10, and the options are around 9. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I had the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking in terms of interatomic distance as the edge length, but maybe the interatomic distance is different?

Wait, wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, but in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the actual edge length is different. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is not a, but the distance between two particular atoms, perhaps along a diagonal or something else.

Wait, no, wait. The interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice. In a cubic system, it's the edge length. But in a rhombohedral, the edges are a, but the interatomic distance would still be a, because the structure is based on a simple lattice. Hmm, maybe it's the distance between atoms diagonally that I'm thinking of.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in some structures is along the edge, but in others, it's along a different direction. For example, in a face-centered cubic, the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonal, but in a simple cubic, it's along the edge.

Wait, but in a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is a, which is the same as the edge length. So the given interatomic distance (10 Angstrom) is 'a' of the rhombohedral structure.

So back to the calculation. Oh wait, but the options are higher than 10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator:

3 + 6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3.

Wait, because 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is 3 +3√3 = 3(1 +sqrt(3)).

So sqrt( denominator )=sqrt(3(1 +sqrt(3)) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute 3(1 +1.732) =3*(2.732)=8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863 as before.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.493 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms, which is about three times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Miller indices. The question is about the (111) plane. Oh, wait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, so in a crystal, the (111) plane is one of the planes in the lattice. But perhaps the formula I used is correct for the (hkl) plane.

But I'm getting a result that's way smaller than the options, which suggests I did something wrong. Maybe I inverted the formula.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the formula I used is for the interplanar spacing in a unit cell with a basis, but in this case, the structure is simple, so maybe not. Or perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach. The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can also be written using the relation between a, the angles, and the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But perhaps I should use the formula for d-spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should have a factor of 1/(h² +k² +l² - 2 h k cosα + ... ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is actually:

d_{hkl} = [ (a²)/(h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα)) ]^(1/2)

Wait, no, wait. I've probably confused the formula. Let me try to recall the Miller-Bravais law.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 A^2 + k^2 B^2 + l^2 C^2 ) + 2 hk AB cosγ + 2 hl AC cosβ + 2 kl BC cosα } }

Wait, but that's for a general system where a, b, c are the lattice parameters, and α,β,γ are the angles between the axes. But in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and α=β=γ.

So substituting a=b=c = a, and α=β=γ=θ=30 degrees.

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes:

(h² a² +k² a² + l² a²) + 2 hk a² cosθ + 2 hl a² cosθ + 2 kl a² cosθ.

Factor out a²:

a² [ h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ ]

So d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( a² [ h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ ] ) )

Which simplifies to:

d = 1/( a * sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ ) )

Wait, no, wait. Because the formula is 1/( sqrt( ... ) ), but wait, no:

Wait, wait, the formula is:

d = [ (a² (h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cosγ + 2 hl cosβ + 2 kl cosα )) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, so that's 1/sqrt( a² ( ... ) ), which is 1/(a * sqrt( ... ) )

But wait, that would make d = 1/( a * sqrt( ... ) )

But that can't be right, because then d would be 1/(10 * sqrt( ... ) ), which would be very small.

But in our previous calculation, we had d= a / sqrt( ... ), which gives a reasonable distance.

So I think I must have the formula wrong. Let me look up the correct formula.

Wait, I'm supposed to imagine I'm a student trying to figure this out. So I might be getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)}}}

Wait, but that would mean that the earlier calculation is correct, but it gives a d of about 3.49 Angstrom, which is not among the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \sqrt{ \frac{a^2}{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)} } }

Which would be a divided by the square root, same as before.

So that brings me back to d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, but the options are in the 9-10 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of the angles. Wait, the angles are 30 degrees. Wait, in some contexts, the angles are defined as the angles between the edges, but perhaps in the formula, it's the angles between the reciprocal axes or something else.

Wait, another thought. Am I confusing the angles in the formula? Let me think: in the formula, the angles used are the angles between the lattice vectors a, b, c. For a rhombohedral system, the angles are all the same, but I might have to consider whether they're the angles between the vectors or their supplements.

Wait, no. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are the angles between the edges. So perhaps the formula uses cos(180 - theta), but that would invert the cosine. Wait, 30 degrees is acute, but in a rhombohedral structure, the angles are often considered as the angles in the unit cell, which can be acute or obtuse, but in this case, it's 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should use cos(180 - 30) = -cos(30) = -√3/2 ≈-0.8660.

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me try that.

So, replacing cos(30) with -0.8660.

Then, in the formula:

sum = 3 + 6*(-0.8660) = 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

But wait, sqrt of a negative number is impossible. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal axes, which might be 180 - theta. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong; perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² +k² +l² + 2(hk \cos\alpha + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma)}}

Wait, but in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so the formula would be:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30° )

Which as before is 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.493 Angstroms.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the edge length a, but the nearest neighbor distance. For example, in a simple cubic system, the nearest neighbor distance is a, but in a different structure, it might be a√2 or something else.

Wait, but the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So in a simple cubic, a=10. What about in a rhombohedral with a=10?

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance would be along the edge, so it's a as well. So that shouldn't change the result.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is the same as for a cubic system, because of the symmetry. But in that case, the angles being 30 degrees would complicate things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the volume formula for the unit cell and the reciprocal vectors.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ )

But since α=β=γ=30°, let's compute V.

Compute the terms: cos30≈0.8660.

So V= a³ * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3 )

Compute each part:

3*(0.8660)^2 =3*(0.75)=2.25.

2*(0.8660)^3=2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So inside the sqrt: 1 - 2.25 +1.299 = (1 -2.25)=-1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So V= a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2214.

So for a=10 Angstrom, V=10^3 *0.2214=1000*0.2214=221.4 Angstrom^3.

Wait, but how does that help me with the interplanar distance?

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l), and the interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by 1/|G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector is (h, k, l) in terms of the reciprocal basis. The magnitude |G| is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) )

So the magnitude is the same denominator as before.

So d = 1/|G|, but |G| is sqrt(...), so d=1/sqrt(...).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. The reciprocal lattice vectors have a magnitude that's related to the interplanar spacing. Specifically, d = 2π / |G|, but for the purpose of this problem, the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck.

Compute 3 +6*(cos30°).

So cos30= sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

6*0.8660≈5.196.

3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.493 Angstroms.

But the options are around 9 Angstroms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I confused the angles. What if the angles in the formula are 180-30=150 degrees? Because sometimes the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal axes, which are 180-theta. Let me try that.

So, if the angles are 150 degrees, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.8660.

So the sum inside the sqrt becomes:

3 +6*(-0.8660)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

But that gives a negative number under the square root, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula uses the sin instead of cos, but that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / ... something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) )

Wait, but that would change the sign. Let me try that.

In that case, denominator inside the sqrt becomes 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3-5.196= -2.196. Again, impossible.

So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about the structure. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a cubic system deformed by a shear along one axis. Another approach could be to compute the lattice vectors and then find the plane.

The lattice vectors are a, b, c. In rhombohedral, a = b = c =10 Angstroms, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane intercepting the lattice vectors at (1,1,1). The interplanar distance can be found by the formula:

d = [ (a . (b × c)) / sqrt( (a² (k² + l²) + b² (h² +l²) + c² (h² +k²)) - (a . b)(h k) - (a . c)(h l) - (b . c)(k l) ) ) ] / (h² +k² +l²) )^{1/2}

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the volume approach can help. The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

So for V, earlier calculation was about 221.4 Ang^3.

The (111) plane's interplanar distance can be found by:

d = 1 / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) )) ) * (2π)/a.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal lattice approach.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

u = (1/a)(b × c),
v = (1/a)(c × a),
w = (1/a)(a × b).

But for a rhombohedral system, since a=b=c, and angles are same, the reciprocal vectors can be calculated.

The (111) plane corresponds to the reciprocal vector (1,1,1).

The magnitude of the reciprocal vector is:

|G| = sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1*1 cosγ + 1*1 cosβ + 1*1 cosα) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 6 cos30) = sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So the interplanar distance is 2π / |G|.

Wait, no, that would be for the reciprocal lattice. The actual interplanar distance is d=2π/|G|, but no, wait, no, the interplanar distance d is related to the reciprocal vector via d = 2π / |G|, but that's for the reciprocal lattice. In our case, we're directly using the formula for d in terms of the real lattice.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

The formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) ) )

So with a=10, and all angles 30 degrees, and hkl=111.

So it's 10 / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2) )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Compute 3√3: approximately 5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstroms.

But the options are all about 9.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure, might not be a. Hmm.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2. So perhaps in this structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√(some factor), and interatomic distance being 10 Angstrom is that distance, not a.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because in a simple cubic, a is the nearest neighbor distance, but in other structures, like fcc, it's different.

So if this structure is a rhombohedral with edge length a, and the nearest neighbor distance is d_nn = a√( something ), then perhaps I should express a in terms of d_nn.

But how?

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure with angles θ, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, so it's a. Therefore, the nearest neighbor distance is a, as in the simple cubic.

Wait, but that would imply that a=10 Angstroms. So our earlier calculation holds.

But the options don't match, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Let me think: perhaps d = sqrt( a^2 * (h² +k² +l²) ) / denominator.

Wait, no, that would be same as a / denominator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and then multiply by a.

Wait, but that brings me back to the same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( ... )

No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Miller indices. The (111) plane's interplanar distance is calculated as:

d = a / sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) )

Which, as before, gives approximately 3.49 Angstroms. But I'm not seeing any option close to that.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. But that doesn't make sense. The angles in the formula are those between the lattice vectors.

Hmm. Maybe I should double-check the problem statement.

The problem says it's a rhombohedral crystal, interatomic distance 10 Angstrom, angles α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So, perhaps the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure is a.

So a=10.

So then, the calculation is as before.

But again, that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me try to find another formula.

Another approach: The interplanar distance for a general plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 (sin^2 α / sin^2 β) + k^2 (sin^2 β / sin^2 γ) + l^2 (sin^2 γ / sin^2 α )) + 2 hk (sin α sin β cos γ)/(sin^2 β sin^2 γ) + ... } }

Wait, that seems overly complicated. Perhaps that's for a different system.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system, which can be written as:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ}}}

Where θ is the angle between the edges, 30 degrees.

So with h=k=l=1, θ=30.

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(1 +1 +1)*cos30 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = same as before, 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.493.

But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing? No, that would give 2.863, which also doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) ) )

But that would give denominator sqrt(3 -6*(0.866)) = sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation I keep getting is about 3.49 Angstroms, but the options are in the 9 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, or perhaps the question is referring to a different kind of distance.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is not the edge length, but the distance between atoms along a diagonal or some other direction. For example, in a face-centered cubic, the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, which is a√2/2.

If that's the case, then a would be the edge length, and the nearest neighbor distance is a√2/2=10.

So a=10 *2/√2 = 10√2≈14.142 Angstroms.

Then, substituting a=14.142 into the interplanar distance formula for (111):

d= a / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )=14.142 / sqrt(8.196)=14.142 /2.863≈4.94 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, if the given interatomic distance is along the space diagonal, which in a cube is a√3. So a√3=10 → a=10/√3≈5.7735.

Then, d= (5.7735)/sqrt(8.196)≈5.7735/2.863≈2.017 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two specific atoms, not the edge length.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms in the same plane but not along the edge. For example, in a hexagonal close-packed structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, but others are along other directions.

But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not the edge length, but the distance between two atoms that are next-nearest neighbors, such as across a face diagonal in a cubic system. Then, their distance would be a√2.

So a√2=10 → a=10/√2≈7.071 Angstroms.

Substituting a=7.071 into the formula:

d=7.071 / sqrt(8.196)=7.071 /2.863≈2.467 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a different system, and rhombohedral requires another approach.

Wait, another thought. The interplanar distance can also be calculated using the formula:

d = \frac{ a \sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 }

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² - 2 hk \cos\gamma - 2 hl \cos\beta - 2 kl \cos\alpha} }

Then, for our case:

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6*(0.866)) = 10 / sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the problem is that the calculation gives about 3.49 Angstroms, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) )) * [1 + (some term with cosθ) ]

But I can't think of such a formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) )) )

But that would give d= a * sqrt(3)/sqrt(8.196) )=10 * 1.732/2.863≈ (17.32)/2.863≈6.046 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a.

Wait, denominator is 8.196. So reciprocal is 0.12195. Multiply by a=10 →1.2195 Angstrom. No, that's smaller.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting to multiply by a factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is given by the formula in terms of the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vectors. But I think that's the same as what I did before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that would give 3 -6*(0.866) =3-5.196=-2.196 → sqrt of negative number, impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different trigonometric function. Like using sin instead of cos.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses sin instead of cos. So let's try that.

d=10/sqrt(3 +6*sin30 )

Sin30=0.5. So 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )

In cubic systems, with a=10, that's 10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstroms. But in this case, the angles are 30, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, but this is just a cubic system when angles are 90, but in our case, they are 30.

But perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options more carefully.

Options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

So all are about 9 Angstroms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, I'm getting a denominator of sqrt(8.196)= about 2.863. So 1/2.863≈0.349.

So d=10 *0.349=3.49 Angstroms.

But none of the options match.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of 2.863 which is about 0.349, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, if I compute:

d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt(8.196 )

Which is 10 * 1.732 / 2.863 ≈17.32 / 2.863≈6.04 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me compute 3 +6*cos30 more accurately.

cos30≈0.8660254.

So 6*0.8660254=5.1961524.

3+5.1961524=8.1961524.

sqrt(8.1961524)=2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.493 Angstroms.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the option that is approximately 3.49, but there's none.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula, and the correct formula is:

d= a / sqrt(1/(h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) )

Wait, that would be 10 / sqrt( (1/3) + 2*(3* (sqrt(3)/2)) )

But that's 10 / sqrt( (0.333) + 5.196 ) =10/sqrt(5.529)=10/2.351≈4.25 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are not the angles between the lattice vectors, but the angles between the faces. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles 180 - 30 =150 degrees. So cos(150)= -0.8660.

So the denominator becomes:

3 +6*(-0.8660)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is impossible. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. I found a source online that says:

The interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ} }

Which is what I used earlier.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the problem is that the options are incorrect. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but the distance between atoms in a different configuration. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, but there are other atoms at a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms not along the edge, but along a different direction.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between (000) and (111) in the structure. But that's the interplanar distance, which is what we're being asked to find.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the diagonal of the rhombohedral unit cell.

Wait, in a rhombohedral unit cell, the space diagonal is sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2*a*a (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) )

Which, with a=10 and angles=30, would be sqrt(300 + 2*100*(0.866*3) )= sqrt(300 + 200*2.598)=sqrt(300 +519.6)=sqrt(819.6)=28.63 Angstroms.

But that's not helpful.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms separated by vectors h, k, l, but that's the same as the edge length.

I'm stuck. I think I have to go with the calculation as correct and maybe the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

Which with h=k=l=1, θ=30:

Denominator: 3 + 6*0.866 ≈8.196.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm. Maybe the question is asking for something else.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is for a different plane, like (222).

Let me compute d for (222):

h=k=l=2.

Denominator: (4+4+4) + 2*(4*0.866*3 )=12 + 2*(12*0.866)=12 +12*1.732=12+20.784=32.784.

sqrt(32.784)=5.726.

d=10/5.726≈1.746 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the plane is (100).

For (100), h=1, k=0, l=0.

Denominator: 1 +0 +0 + 0 +0 +0=1.

d=10/sqrt(1)=10 Angstroms. So option D is 10.05, which is close, but the plane in the question is (111).

Hmm. So (100) gives 10, which is option D, but the question is about (111), which I calculated as about 3.49. But perhaps the question made a mistake, and the intended answer is D) 10.05.

But no, the question clearly states (111) plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length, and the correct answer is 3.49, but it's not an option. So perhaps the options are wrong.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle. The angles given are 30 degrees, but perhaps the formula uses 60 degrees.

Wait, 60 degrees: cos60=0.5.

So denominator becomes 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplement angle. So 180-30=150 degrees, cos150=-0.866.

Denominator:3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / ( something )

But I'm not finding any other way.

I think I have to conclude that the correct calculation leads to approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but none of the options match. But since the options provided are in the 9 range, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, but the interplanar distance is for a different plane. For example, perhaps I'm using (111) when the question is about (222). But no, the question clearly says (111).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the interplanar distance.

Wait, if d=3.49, then the reciprocal is about 0.286. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. But that would be 2.863, which is not an option.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. But perhaps I should look for the correct answer among the options, even though my calculation doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct denominator is 3 -6*cos30, which would be 3 -5.196= -2.196, which is impossible. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-30) ), which is -0.866, leading to denominator 3+6*(-0.866)= -2.196, which is impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta), but theta is 150 degrees, which is 180-30=150. So cos150=-0.866.

Which leads to denominator 3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196, impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(theta) where theta is the angle between the plane normals. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of a rhombohedral system. In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been distorted along one diagonal. The (111) plane would then have a different spacing due to this distortion.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) )

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:

d = (a) * (sqrt( h² +k² +l² )) / (sqrt( ... )

Which would give d= sqrt(3)*10 / sqrt(8.196) )= (17.32) /2.863≈6.046 Angstroms.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 10 * sqrt( (3) / (3 +6 cos30) )

Which is 10 * sqrt(3/8.196)=10*sqrt(0.366)=10*0.605≈6.05 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I have to conclude that according to the formula, the correct interplanar distance is approximately 3.49 Angstroms. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the question intended to ask for something else or there's a mistake in the options.

But given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the interatomic distance is not a, but another parameter.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two specific atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure is along a different direction. For example, perhaps the atoms are positioned such that the interatomic distance is a√(some factor), and I need to adjust a accordingly.

For example, if the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, then the distance would be a√(1 +1 +1 + 2*(1 +1 +1)*cos30 )

Which is a√(3 +6*cos30 )=a√(8.196)=a*2.863.

So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then a=10/2.863≈3.493 Angstroms.

Then, the interplanar distance for (111) would be d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )= (3.493)/2.863≈1.219 Angstroms. Hmm, but that's even smaller.

I'm not making progress here. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation as correct and perhaps the options are incorrect. But since the options don't include 3.49, I'm forced to consider that perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Which for hkl=111:

d=10 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(8.196)=10*1.732/2.863≈6.04 Angstroms.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a squared.

Wait, 10^2 / 8.196=100/8.196≈12.20.

So sqrt(12.20)=3.492.

Hmm.

I give up. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but since it's not among the options, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstroms, but I can't see how.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)}}
\]

### Substituting the values:
- \( h = k = l = 1 \)
- \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

The denominator becomes:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) = 3 + 6 \cdot 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

Thus:
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}} \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Analysis of the options:
The calculated interplanar distance is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), which does not match any of the provided options (\( 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)). This suggests either a discrepancy in the problem setup or a potential error in the provided options. However, since the question explicitly asks for the interplanar distance of the \( (111) \) plane, the calculation appears correct based on the given formula and parameters.

Given the mismatch, the most plausible conclusion is that the problem or options may contain an error. Nevertheless, if forced to select an option, none align with the calculated result.
