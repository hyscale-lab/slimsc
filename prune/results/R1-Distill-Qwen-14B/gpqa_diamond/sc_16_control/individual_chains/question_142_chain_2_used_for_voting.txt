Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the options are A to D, each with a different coordinate.

Hmm, first I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states, so their density matrices are convex combinations of projectors.

Wait, the given ρ looks like it's a combination of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Both of those are projectors for the basis states. So ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. That makes sense because each term is a projector, and 1/2 is the weight, so it's a mixed state with equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation, which is a geometric way to visualize qubit states. The Bloch sphere is a unit sphere in three-dimensional space (r = (x, y, z)), where each point on the surface corresponds to a pure state, and points inside correspond to mixed states.

For a pure state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, the Bloch vector is (2 Re(β α*), 2 Im(β α*), |α|² - |β|²). Wait, no, more accurately, it's (α β* - β α*, 2 Re(β α*), |α|² - |β|²), but maybe I should think in terms of the vector components.

Alternatively, I remember that any single qubit state can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me compute each component of ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write out |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| in terms of their matrix forms.

|0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix:
[[1, 0],
 [0, 0]]

|1⟩⟨1| is:
[[0, 0],
 [0, 1]]

So adding them together gives:
[[1, 0],
 [0, 1]]

Then, multiply by 1/2:
[[1/2, 0],
 [0, 1/2]]

So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2.

Now, the general form of a density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is:

ρ = (I + x σx + y σy + z σz)/2

Where σx, σy, σz are the Pauli matrices. Let's write them out:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So substituting into the general form:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ] + (1/2) (x σx + y σy + z σz )

Wait, no, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2, so when expanded:

(1/2)I + (x σx + y σy + z σz)/(2)

So now, comparing to our given ρ, which is (I)/2. That means the other terms must be zero. So x σx + y σy + z σz must be zero.

Looking at each Pauli matrix term:

- The coefficient of σx is x/2. For that term to be zero, x must be zero.
- Similarly, y/2 must be zero → y=0.
- z/2 must be zero → z=0.

So the vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but let me check this. Alternatively, I can think about ρ as a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. The density matrix for a completely mixed state (equal probabilities for both basis states) should be (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is exactly what we have here.

In the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin because it's the maximally mixed state, corresponding to r = (0,0,0). So that would be option C.

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0): That doesn't seem right. If r had components, say, x=1, y=1, z=0, that would correspond to a pure state on the Bloch sphere, but our state is mixed.

B) (0,0,1): That would correspond to the state |1⟩, but our state is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, not a pure state.

C) (0,0,0): That's the completely mixed state, which matches our ρ.

D) (1,1,1): That's a pure state, but again, our state is mixed.

So the correct answer must be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit state can be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

which implies that the terms involving the Pauli matrices (\(x \sigma_x + y \sigma_y + z \sigma_z\)) must vanish. Therefore, \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 0\), so the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Examining the options:

- **A) (1,1,0):** This corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B) (0,0,1):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|1\rangle\), not the given mixed state.
- **C) (0,0,0):** This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the given \(\rho\).
- **D) (1,1,1):** This corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
