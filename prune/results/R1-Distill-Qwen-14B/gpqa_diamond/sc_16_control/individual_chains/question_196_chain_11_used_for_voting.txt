Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement, like F = -kx. But this is a relativistic version, which probably means we need to consider the effects of special relativity, like how mass increases with velocity or something.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. Oh right, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't use the classical expressions directly.

Relativistic effects come into play because as the mass approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases, which would affect the energy calculations. I remember that the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, in this problem, the oscillator is obeying Hooke's law, which in the relativistic case might not be the same as the classical one. Maybe the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² anymore? Or is it? I think for small oscillations, it's similar, but maximum amplitude A is given, so perhaps the potential at A is (1/2)kA², same as before.

Wait, but the problem is in one dimension, so maximum displacement is A. At that point, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because momentum p = gamma m v, so KE = (gamma - 1)mc². So the approach must involve considering the total energy.

So the total mechanical energy E is conserved. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy might still be (1/2)kA², or does it change? I think in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential can be considered the same as the classical case if the amplitude isn't too large, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic. So E = KE = (gamma - 1) mc².

Setting E = (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1 ) mc².

Solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as a variable to make it easier. Let's say (k A²)/(2 m c²) = alpha. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1+alpha).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1+alpha)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+alpha)^2].

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2].

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1+alpha)^2:

v² = c² [ ( (1+alpha)^2 -1 ) / (1+alpha)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Hmm, but alpha might be small? Not necessarily, but maybe for the given options, we can proceed.

Wait, since alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a positive quantity, when multiplied by (1+alpha), we can write:

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, let's write the equation again:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²)

Which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [ (2 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² ) )

Wait, because 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Thus,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 m c^2) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4) / [ (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2 ]

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2

Let me compute denominator:

(2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 = [ 2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2 ( 1 + alpha )^2, where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + alpha)^2 )

Wait, that's 4 m² c^4 times (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, no, denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A² )^2 = [2 m c² (1 + alpha) ]^2 = 4 m² c^4 (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + alpha)^2 ]

Which simplifies to 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha )^2

= alpha ( 2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2

But if alpha is small, we could approximate, but I don't think that's the case here. So let's factor.

Wait, perhaps we can factor it differently.

Wait, considering that alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), perhaps there's a better way to express this.

But perhaps it's easier to write v_max in terms of c, using the above expression.

Wait, let's compute it:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2 alpha + alpha² ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, but that doesn't look like any of the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, not sure. Let me compute the expression I have.

Wait, another approach: Let me start from 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as beta.

So,

gamma = 1 + beta.

So,

gamma = (1 + beta) => 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1+beta) 

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+ beta )^2.

Which is the same as before.

So,

v² = c² [ ( (1+beta)^2 -1 ) / (1+beta)^2 ) ]

v² = c² [ (1 + 2 beta + beta² -1 ) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c² [ (2 beta + beta² ) ] / (1 + beta )².

Factor numerator:

beta (2 + beta) / (1 + beta )².

Hmm. Maybe we can factor this as beta (1 + beta + 1 ) / (1 + beta )². Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write v in terms of gamma.

Wait, but let me plug beta back in.

Beta is (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

So, 2 + beta = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps we can write the expression as:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + beta )^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 ]

Wait, that's ( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 = (1 + 2 beta + beta² -1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 = (2 beta + beta² ) / (1 + beta )^2.

But I don't see a way to make this match any of the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m) )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I should compute 1/(1 - (k A²/(2m) )).

Wait, the denominator in option A is (1 - (k A²/(2m)) ) squared.

But beta is (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So, if I have 1 - (k A²)/(2m) = 1 - (beta c² )/( m c^2 ) * (2m c² ) / (2m c² )

Wait, let me think. Let me compute (k A²)/(2m) = (k A²)/(2m) * 1.

But beta is (k A² )/( 2 m c² )

So, (k A²)/(2m) = beta c^2.

Hmm.

So, 1 - (k A^2)/(2m) = 1 - beta c^2.

But in our expression, we have terms with beta, not beta c squared.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: the potential energy in the relativistic case.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the potential is (1/2) k A², but in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be different. Or perhaps the spring's force is still F = -k x, but the energy calculations are different because of relativistic mass.

Wait, maybe the approach is to use conservation of energy, considering relativistic kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so KE is zero, and all energy is potential. So E = (1/2) k A².

At the equilibrium point, velocity is maximum, so KE is maximum, and potential energy is zero. So KE = (gamma -1 ) m c².

So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1 ) m c².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) as delta.

So,

gamma = 1 + delta.

Which leads to:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + delta.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + delta ).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + delta )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + delta )^2.

Which gives,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + delta )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ ( (1 + delta )^2 - 1 ) ] / (1 + delta )^2 )

= c * sqrt( ( 2 delta + delta² ) / (1 + delta )^2 )

= c * sqrt( delta (2 + delta ) ) / (1 + delta )

Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the options directly.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, that expression is:

sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )]^2 ) * c.

Which is the same as sqrt( [1 - 1/(1 + delta )^2 ] ), which is exactly what I have.

Wait, because delta is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So, option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + delta )^2 )

Which matches my expression for v.

So, according to this, the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, but that doesn't look right because my expression has 1 - 1/(1 + delta )^2 under the square root. 

Option A has 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ) ) squared, which seems different because their denominator doesn't have c².

Option C is the classical expression, which doesn't account for relativity, so it's probably incorrect.

So, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), spring constant \( k \), and maximum amplitude \( A \), we use the principle of energy conservation. The total mechanical energy \( E \) is conserved, and at maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is expressed relativistically as \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \delta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \delta.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \delta},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \delta)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \delta)^2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \delta)^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \delta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators that do not match the derived expression.
- **Option C** is the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
