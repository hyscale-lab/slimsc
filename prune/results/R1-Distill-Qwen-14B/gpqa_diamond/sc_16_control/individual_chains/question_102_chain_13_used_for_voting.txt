Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So, the setup is that someone created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand and receptor each have their own ORFs. The ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. Oh, right, the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, maybe for expression. Then the receptor has an IRES upstream. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to expression of the downstream gene, especially in certain cell types or conditions. So maybe the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but the receptor might have a weaker expression because IRES is not as strong as a standard promoter.

The ORFs have stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. So, between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272. So, when the Cre is expressed, it would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette and allowing expression of the downstream (mCherry for ligand, eGFP for receptor). But I'm not exactly sure how the lox systems work here. LoxP is used with Cre to delete or invert, and lox2272 is a variant. So, if you have a stop cassette between the ORF and the fluorescent marker, then Cre would excise that, allowing the markers to be expressed.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. But in the mouse model, after crossing with SOX10-Cre mice, they didn't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the receptor-eGFP should be expressed and fluorescent.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for their construct. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, I think. So the Cre would be active in those cells, leading to recombination of the lox sites. But in this case, the offspring isn't showing green (eGFP) under confocal. So why isn't eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means acting on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression of eGFP in the construct? I don't think this directly relates to the Western blot or the fluorescence result. Unless the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere, but the question is about expression, not function.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would Cre expression cause this? Maybe the construct's signal sequence is wrong. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't showing. Could be, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: Enhancer missing for ligand and receptor. The construct uses CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't the issue. Unless the promoter is not active in the cells where SOX10 is expressed. But SOX10-Cre would activate the construct in neural crest-derived cells, so if the promoter works there, then expression should happen. I'm not sure.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP would be misexpressed, perhaps leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. But the question says the vector has the receptor ORF fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the fusion is not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor might not function correctly. But if the frames are wrong, the eGFP wouldn't show up because the stop codon would be read earlier, so no eGFP would be made. But how would that happen? Because the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. If the lox2272 stop is not removed, the eGFP is not expressed. Oh wait, so when Cre is expressed, it should remove the stop cassette. But maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells being looked at.

Wait, the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre. So SOX10-Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, which are the source of the cells expressing the ligand and receptor. So the Cre should only be active in the neural crest and its derivatives, like astrocytes? So the construct would have the receptors and ligands expressed there.

But the offspring is visualized under confocal. They only see mCherry if ligand is expressed, and eGFP if receptor is expressed. In the question, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The ligand is first, with its own promoter (CBA), then the IRES, then the receptor. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is under IRES, which might not be active unless in certain cell types. But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, so ligand is ligand-mCherry, and receptor is receptor-eGFP.

But what if the Cre isn't working? Because the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a transgene, typically activated in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre is expressed in the right cells, leading to removal of stop cassettes. So ligand and receptor should be expressed with their respective tags.

But the problem is that in the Western blot, they used total proteins. So perhaps the expression is low, but in the mouse, in the tissue they're looking at, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed. Or perhaps the stop cassettes aren't being removed.

Wait, but the vector is lox-Cre, so the loxP and lox2272 stops are flanked by specific sites. Cre would only remove the loxP and lox2272 stops if it has the correct target sites. If the construct in the mouse is such that the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre (which typically recognizes loxP), then the stop cassettes would remain, preventing eGFP expression.

Ah! Because lox2272 is a variant of loxP. Cre from the SOX10-Cre line is recognizing loxP sites, but the stop cassette for the receptor is between lox2272. So if the Cre can't recognize lox2272, the stop cassette won't be excised. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.

Wait, but lox2272 is a mutant lox site that Cre can recognize, but it's only recombined with another lox2272 or perhaps with loxP. Wait, no, I think that Cre can recognize lox2272 sites but they're designed for different applications, like in FLP-mediated recombination. Or maybe the lox2272 is used with another Cre variant, but the standard Cre might not recognize it. Alternatively, lox2272 is a site that recombines with other lox2272 sites but not with loxP. Hmm.

Wait, in this construct, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. When Cre is expressed, it would excise the loxP sites (for the ligand) but not the lox2272 sites (for the receptor). Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Unless the Cre variant does. So the ligand would be expressed (since the loxP is excised), but the receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

Wait, but in the question, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the ligand would be expressed regardless of Cre, because its stop is under loxP. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry when Cre is present, because the stop is excised. But the receptor's stop is under lox2272. So the Cre in the mouse can't excise that, so the receptor's expression is blocked. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Therefore, the reason would be that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being removed because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So the receptor-eGFP construct isn't expressed.

Wait, but the options don't directly address this. Let me look again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette isn't removed, then the entire ORF would be ligand followed by stop, and receptor followed by stop. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But that's due to the stop cassette not being excised. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed because Cre can't recognize lox2272.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this reasoning?

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is present, which is a strong enhancer/promoter. So the issue isn't the enhancer.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, the stop would be premature, but in this case, the stop is due to the cassette. So I don't think D is correct.

Option B: stuck in Golgi. That would prevent surface expression but not necessarily expression at all. Also, the Western blot uses total proteins, so it would detect whether the protein is made, regardless of localization.

So maybe the stop isn't being removed, meaning the issue is that the stop cassette isn't flanked by loxP sites that Cre can recognize. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly state that. Wait, perhaps another angle: the vector was designed with the ligand and receptor in a way that the stop cassettes are in between. So the ligand is expressed only if the loxP is removed, and the receptor only if the lox2272 is removed. But if the Cre can't remove the lox2272, then the receptor isn't expressed.

In this case, the mouse model is in the wt background, so perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells being examined. Wait, no, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest-derived cells.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (ligand and receptor) were used in the Western blot, but the question says that the blot shows signals proportional to actin. So if the proteins were expressed, they'd show up. But maybe the expression is low or not happening, but the question says that the blot was done after transfection—so the expression is confirmed?

Wait, the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and the Western blot after transfection shows signals. So likely, the construct is working in the transfected cells. But when the mouse is made, and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Therefore, the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed in the mouse. That could be because the stop isn't being removed. So the stop for the receptor is under lox2272. But if Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would Cre not recognize lox2272? Because standard Cre recognizes loxP, not necessarily lox2272. So the lox2272 is a FRT-like site, perhaps, and requires a different recombinase, like FLP.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: loxP is the standard site for Cre. lox2272 is a variant, but I think it's for use with a different Cre or maybe for FLP. Wait, no, lox2272 is a mutant lox site that can be used in combination with standard loxP sites, allowing for inversion or excision when Cre is present. Or wait, no—maybe the lox2272 is a site that can only be cut by a Cre variant, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is between the receptor and eGFP, and the Cre doesn't recognize that. So the stop remains, preventing expression.

Another possibility: the vector uses two different lox sites, loxP and lox2272, and the Cre doesn't recognize the lox2272 sites. So the ligand's stop is removed (because it's flanked by loxP), but the receptor's stop isn't, because the Cre can't cut lox2272. Therefore, only the ligand is expressed, not the receptor.

So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So in the offspring, when looking for eGFP, no signal. So the issue is that the receptor's stop cassette isn't being removed.

Looking at the options again, which one fits? Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would lead to a stop, but in this case, the stop is due to the cassette, not frameshift. So not D.

Option C: enhancer missing. But the promoter is present. So C is unlikely.

Option B: stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP isn't expressed, it's not about the Golgi. So B isn't it.

The correct reason is that the stop for the receptor isn't being excised because Cre can't recognize lox2272. But none of the options explicitly say that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But the problem is that the stop cassette isn't removed, not a frameshift.

Hmm, perhaps the question is pointing towards the construct design. The ligand is 5' with mCherry, receptor 3' with eGFP. The stop cassettes are between them. So when Cre is expressed, the ligand would be ligand-mCherry, and receptor-eGFP.

But if the vector is such that the ORFs are not correctly placed, like the receptor isn't in frame with eGFP, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the vector, the ORF for the receptor is fused to eGFP. So if the stop cassette is in between, and the stop isn't removed, then the receptor can't be expressed, so the eGFP isn't either.

But why would the stop cassette's lox sites not be recognized? Because of the wrong lox site.

So the problem is that the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre, so the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state this. So perhaps the best fit is option D. Because if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the stop cassette is a separate issue.

Wait, perhaps the real problem is that the receptor isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the answer is option C, which states that the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But no, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter.

Alternatively, maybe the mouse is expressing the Cre, but the Cre can't get into the nucleus or isn't active in the right cells. But the question says that the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to activate in neural crest cells.

Wait, perhaps the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous, so expression is lower. But that might not prevent expression entirely.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working because the correct cell type isn't present. But the IRES is supposed to allow some expression without a promoter.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem is that in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. The possible reasons are:

1. The stop cassette isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. That would be because Cre can't recognize lox2272. But the options don't have this.

2. The construct is designed wrong, like the eGFP is out of frame. But that's option D.

3. The promoter is missing, but the ligand has a promoter (CBA). The receptor is under IRES. So option C is less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional, but that would affect the receptor's expression when in the presence of Cre.

Wait, when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, so the receptor would be under its own IRES. IRES doesn't require a promoter, but it's cell-type specific. So if the construct is in a cell where the IRES isn't active, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the SOX10-Cre mice are designed to have Cre active in neural crest cells, which should be the right cell type for the receptor expression.

Wait, but the construct's IRES may not be functional in those cells. But IRES elements are often used in such constructs to allow for some expression even without a promoter. But if the IRES doesn't work, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed, leading to no eGFP.

But in that case, the issue is the IRES, not the eGFP being in frame. So that's not directly any of the options.

Hmmm. I think the best fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to eGFP not being expressed. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP won't be expressed. So the real issue is the stop cassette not being excised, which would be because the lox sites are not recognized by Cre. But since that option isn't present, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, no, the stop cassette isn't the same as being out of frame. The stop cassette is a separate issue. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But perhaps the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, but that would require a frameshift. But in this case, the stop is preventing expression.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because the stop cassette is in between. So the construct is ligand, then a stop, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP. Without the stop being removed, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place.

But the question states that the offspring don't show eGFP, so the issue is that the stop isn't being removed. If the stop isn't being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop being removed?

Because the lox sites are lox2272 and Cre can't recognize them. So the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't mention this, so perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the Western blot result indicates that the proteins are being expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But in the question, the Western blot was done after transfection, which showed signals. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression is not happening.

Alternatively, maybe the vector is not correctly designed. Oh, wait, the ligand is at 5', with mCherry, and the receptor is at 3', with eGFP. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES. The stops are between ligand and mCherry (loxP) and between receptor and eGFP (lox2272).

So when Cre is present, it removes the loxP stop, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed, and the lox2272 stop remains, preventing receptor-eGFP expression. Oh! Wait, that's possible. If the ligand and receptor are on the same vector, but the stop for the receptor isn't removed, then only ligand is expressed, not the receptor.

But why would only the ligand's stop be removed? Because the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, which Cre can cut. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which may not be cut by Cre, so it remains. Thus, only the ligand is expressed, not the receptor. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green signal.

But why would the ligand's stop be cut? Because the CBA promoter is driving the ligand expression, and the stop is under loxP. So when Cre is present, the ligand is expressed, as ligand-mCherry. But the receptor remains under its IRES, but the stop isn't removed, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

So, in the mouse, only ligand-mCherry is expressed, and receptor-eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed, which is why no green signal is seen.

So the reason is that the stop for the receptor isn't being removed because the Cre can't recognize lox2272.

But the options don't mention this. So perhaps the intended answer is another option.

Looking again, the question is about the failure to see eGFP. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Another possibility: the IRES element isn't functional. So even if the stop is removed, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says that the eGFP isn't expressed, so perhaps the IRES isn't working. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because the ORF is not in frame. So option D states that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP won't be expressed. So no green.

But in the construct, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the ORF is in frame, then the receptor is expressed with eGFP attached. If not, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor might be truncated.

But the question is about the eGFP not showing. So if the ORF isn't in frame, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that the stop cassette isn't removed, not the frame. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe the stop cassettes are not correctly placed. For instance, if the stop is after the receptor, but in the same reading frame, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's a design issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't functional in the cells being examined, so the receptor isn't expressed. But IRES is supposed to allow some expression without a promoter.

Hmm. I'm going to have to go with option D as the answer. Because if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Alternatively, the stop isn't removed. But since the options don't include the stop issue, I think option D is the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, where the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. The ligand ORF contains a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, while the receptor ORF contains a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. After crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via the IRES element.
   - The ligand ORF has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.
   - Cre recombinase is expected to excise these stop cassettes, allowing expression of the respective fluorescent tags (mCherry for the ligand and eGFP for the receptor).

2. **Western Blot Confirmation**:
   - Total protein extracts show signals proportional to actin loading, confirming that the proteins are being expressed. However, this does not directly confirm whether the stop cassettes are excised in the mouse model.

3. **SOX10-Cre Expression**:
   - SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest-derived cells. This suggests that Cre should excise the stop cassettes in the relevant cells.

4. **Lack of eGFP Expression**:
   - The absence of a green signal indicates that the receptor-eGFP construct is not being expressed. This could occur if the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not excised, preventing eGFP expression.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (Paracrine relationship)**: This refers to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor, not their expression. It does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence.
   - **Option B (Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi)**: If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized but not reach the cell surface. However, the Western blot confirms total protein expression, making this unlikely.
   - **Option C (Enhancer missing)**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no evidence that an enhancer is missing, making this unlikely.
   - **Option D (Receptor and eGFP not in frame)**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed. This aligns with the observation of no green signal, as the stop cassette would prevent proper expression of the eGFP.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing the expression of eGFP. This aligns with the observation of no green signal in the confocal microscopy. While the stop cassette issue could also explain the lack of eGFP expression, it is not explicitly addressed in the options. Therefore, the best fit is **Option D**.

Answer: D
