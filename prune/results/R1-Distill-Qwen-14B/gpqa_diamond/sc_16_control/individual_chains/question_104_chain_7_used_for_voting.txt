Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are both in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and this causes the spectral lines to shift. The shift's amplitude (how much it moves) depends on the mass of the planet and other factors.

In this problem, Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (that's 5e-3 angstroms), and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, wait, wait. The RV method measures the velocity of the star, right? Because the star moves due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is given by some equation involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p^3) ) / (M_star^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(1+M_p/M_star)) ) * (1/(sin i)) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look things up right now, so I'll try to remember.

Another approach: the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is:

K = [ (27 * G) / (4 * π^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P).

Wait, I think the formula relates K to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have the same mass (like Neptune), but the K values are different.

So, the key point is that K is related to the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the scaling relations between K, the period P, and the mass of the planet. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV method's velocity semi-amplitude K relates to the star's motion due to the planet. The formula I remember is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (since planets are much less massive than stars), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, the formula simplifies a bit.

So, K ≈ [ (2π G)^(1/3) / (c P^(1/3)) ) ] * ( M_p sin i ) / M_star^(2/3) )

But in this problem, both stars have the same mass (M_star = M_sun), and both planets have the same mass (M_p ~ Neptune mass). Also, the orbits are circular, so sin i = sin 90° = 1.

Therefore, K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)) ), since all other factors are the same for both planets except P.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then if Planet #2 has a higher K, its P must be smaller. But let me check.

Wait, K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But M_p and M_star are the same for both planets and stars, so K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Which means that if K increases, P decreases, because it's inversely proportional.

In the problem, Planet #1 has a K of 5 milliangstrom, and Planet #2 has a K of 7 milliangstrom. So, since K is higher for Planet #2, that would imply a shorter period. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's. So if K2 > K1, P2 < P1, meaning the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So if K is higher, P is smaller. So Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's. So the ratio P2/P1 would be something like 0.85 or 0.36.

But let me think again. Let me get the formula correct. Because I'm a bit confused.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p / M_star) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the scaling. Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the only variable is the period P.

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )

Because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * constant, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * constant.

Taking the ratio: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, if K2 is bigger than K1, that would mean that (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2 < 1.

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

In the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is7 milliangstrom. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Therefore, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is approximately 0.36. So the ratio is about 0.36, meaning Planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, so the question is asking how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's. So that would be P2 = 0.36 * P1, so the factor is 0.36. So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the formula for K is K = ( (v) ) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) → because, K1 = const * P1^(-1/3), K2 = const * P2^(-1/3 ), so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Given that K1 is 5, K2 is 7 → K1/K2 = 5/7.

So:

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

(5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1, which would mean P2 = 0.36 * P1 → P2/P1 = 0.36, so P2 is 0.36 times the period of P1. So it's shorter.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Because I thought that when K is higher, the period is shorter. So if K2 > K1, P2 < P1. So the ratio would be less than one, which matches our calculation.

So the answer should be option A, ~0.36.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. For two planets with the same mass and host star mass, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of their orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), we cube this value:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1, the ratio is \( 0.36 \).
