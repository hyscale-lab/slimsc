Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, which is 1/plx^5. Hmm. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance. So, parallax plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if the distance is r, then plx is 1/r.

Wait, actually, the standard formula is that the parallax in arcseconds (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs (d). So, plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

So, going back, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, let's see: 1/( (1/r) )^5 equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that's the number of stars as a function of r. But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So, it's the change in N as r changes by a small amount, meaning the derivative of N with respect to r, perhaps?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So that might mean the density as a function of distance. But wait, no, the question is phrased a bit ambiguously. Let me read again.

The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant.

We can express plx in terms of r. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r.

So substituting, N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but N is the number of stars in a specific region. So, for a given region, how does the number of stars change as r (distance) increases. So, if r increases, N increases as r^5. So for a given range of r, like from r to r + dr, the number of stars would be proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about the change per unit range of distance. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps it's about the number density, like how many stars per unit distance. Or maybe the number per unit volume? Wait, no, I think the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. Because when astronomers count stars in a region, they're considering a volume. So the number of stars in a thin shell would depend on the volume of that shell.

Wait, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to the surface area (4πr² dr) times the number density (stars per volume). So if the number density (n) is the number per unit volume, then the number of stars in the shell is n * 4πr² dr.

But wait, the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So maybe that's the number density as a function of parallax. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume (n) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm.

Wait, let's think again. Parallax plx is related to distance r as plx = 1/r (in parsecs). So, if N is the number of stars in a region, perhaps it's a function of plx. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a certain region (like a volume) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5). Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * r^5.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then for a given increase in r, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if you're moving a small distance dr away, how does the number of stars in that region change?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. We have N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And plx is 1/r, so N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power of distance. So, as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But the question is phrased as, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's asking for the dependence of N on r for a given change in r. So, the rate of change, like the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but no, the question isn't about the rate of change. It's about how N changes as a function of r. So, if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5—so when r increases by a factor, N increases by that factor to the fifth power.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5. And because plx is 1/r, that becomes N = k * (r)^5. Thus, N is proportional to r^5, so the number of stars increases as r^5. So the correct answer is B) ~r^5.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = 1/r \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto 1/(1/r)^5 \), which simplifies to \( N \propto r^5 \). 

This means the number of stars in the region increases with the fifth power of distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), and since \( N \propto r^5 \), the correct answer is that the number of stars depends on \( r^5 \).

Answer: B
