Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers can prioritize their observations. Let's break down the information given.

Both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the question is about the transit method. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting in front of its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the transit probability formula... I think it's something like R_planet divided by R_star, squared, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability is more about the orbital plane's alignment with our line of sight. I think the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet)^2 divided by (a^2), where a is the semi-major axis. But maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_star / a)², assuming the orbit is randomly oriented. Because the chance that the orbit's inclination is just right for a transit is higher when the orbit is smaller relative to the star's size.

Wait, let me think again. The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star / a)² * ( (R_planet / R_star) )^2 )? Or maybe I'm getting the factors wrong. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2. Because the area of the star is πR_star², and the area where the planet can be in the correct line of sight is πR_star²/(a² - R_star²). Or maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet)² / (a²) , but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's roughly (R_star / a)^2. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight, which depends on the size of the orbit relative to the star's size. The bigger the star (or the smaller the orbit), the higher the chance of alignment. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

So, to find which planet has a higher probability, we need to calculate (R_star / a)^2 for each.

Wait, but what do we know about the parameters? Let's list the given data.

Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass. The orbital period of Planet_1 is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P_2 / 3.

The host stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2 = R (since it says both have same radii because host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radii). So R_star is same for both.

But the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2*M2.

Wait, but how does the mass of the star affect the semi-major axis? Because the orbital period is related to a via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) ) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M >> m, so P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³.

So a³ = (G M P² ) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So for each planet, a1 and a2.

Given that P1 is (P2)/3.

So for Planet_1:

a1^3 = (G M1 (P1)^2 ) / (4 π²) )

Similarly, a2^3 = (G M2 (P2)^2 ) / (4 π²) )

So the ratio a1/a2 would be [ (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²) ]^(1/3)

We know M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (P2)/3, so P1² = P2² /9.

So the ratio inside the brackets is (2) * (1/9) ) = (2/9).

So (a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222, cube root of that is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is approximately 0.6 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute it exactly. Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3):

Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2.

Since R_star is same for both planets, and a1 is smaller than a2, (R/a)^2 will be larger for Planet_1.

Compute (R/a1)^2 = (R/(0.605 a2))^2 ≈ (1 / 0.605 )² * (R/a2)^2 ≈ (2.645)^2 * (R/a2)^2 ≈ 6.98 * (R/a2)^2.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is (R/a1)^2 / (R/a2)^2 = (a2/a1)^2.

Because P is proportional to (R/a)^2, so the ratio is (a2/a1)^2.

From earlier, a1 = 0.605 a2 → a2/a1 = 1 / 0.605 ≈ 1.653.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.653)^2 ≈ 2.733.

So Planet_1 has approximately 2.73 times higher probability to transit than Planet_2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a1 is smaller, (R/a1) is bigger, which would make P1 higher. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Looking back at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. Option C says 1.65 times. Hmm.

Wait, let me recalculate the a1/a2 ratio precisely.

We have a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2² )

Given M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 / 3.

So (M1/M2) = 2, (P1² / P2²) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = (2 * 1/9) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) → exact value?

Cube root of 2 is approximately 1.2599, cube root of 9 is approximately 2.0801.

So cube root of (2/9) is (1.2599 / 2.0801) ≈ 0.605.

So a1 = 0.605 a2.

Then, transit probability P is proportional to (R/a)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1 / 0.605)^2 ≈ (1.6529)^2 ≈ 2.73.

So P1 is about 2.73 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Option C: Planet_1 due to ~1.65 times. But 1.65 is the square root of 2.7, because 1.65 squared is about 2.7. But no, wait, 1.65² is 2.7225, which is approximately 2.7. So if the probability ratio is 2.73, then P1 is 2.73 times P2.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let's double-check the transit probability formula. I've heard that the transit probability is roughly (R*/a)^2, assuming random inclination. But I'm not 100% confident. I think another way to look at it is considering the area where the planet's orbit can be edge-on enough for a transit. The probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2 because the required inclinations are within a certain range.

Alternatively, the actual formula for the transit probability is:

P ≈ (R_star / a)² * ( (R_planet / R_star)^2 ) → but since R_planet << R_star, the term (R_planet / R_star)^2 is negligible, so the main factor is (R/a)^2.

Wait, no, the formula I remember is that the probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 (1 - (R_star/a)^2 )). But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, which is much smaller than a, then it's approximately (R_star/a)^2. Yeah, that makes sense.

So our earlier calculation holds. So Planet_1 has a higher probability, around 2.7 times that of Planet_2.

Therefore, the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \((R_\text{star}/a)^2\), where \(R_\text{star}\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The key parameters provided are:

1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2** have the same mass and circular orbits.
2. **Planet_1** has an orbital period (\(P_1\)) that is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (\(P_2\)), i.e., \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\).
3. The host stars have the same radius (\(R_\text{star,1} = R_\text{star,2} = R\)).
4. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_\text{star,1} = 2M_\text{star,2}\)).

### Step 1: Relating semi-major axis to orbital period and stellar mass
Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_\text{star}\), we find the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_\text{star,1} P_1^2}{M_\text{star,2} P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \(M_\text{star,1} = 2M_\text{star,2}\) and \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\), we get:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot (P_2/3)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \(2/9\) is approximately \(0.605\), so:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2.
\]

### Step 2: Calculating transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_\text{star}/a)^2\). Since \(R_\text{star}\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2.
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2\), we find:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.605}\right)^2 \approx 1.653^2 \approx 2.73.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 1.65 but approximately 2.73.
- **Option D**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability.
