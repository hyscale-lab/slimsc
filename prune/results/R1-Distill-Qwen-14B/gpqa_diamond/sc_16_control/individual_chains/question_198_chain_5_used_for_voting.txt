Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that when metal ions are in solution with ligands, they form complexes, and the stability constants (β) tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the problem gives me four stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because β4 is less than β3. So the order is β3 > β2 > β1 > β4? Or maybe I should double-check the order.

Wait, no, the stability constants usually increase as the number of ligands increases. For example, Co(SCN)1^+ would have β1, Co(SCN)2^(2+) would have β2, and so on. But wait, the β is the formation constant, so the way it's written, each step is the addition of another SCN-.

Wait, but the problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's Co(SCN)_2^(2+), which would be the second complex. Or wait, maybe it's the tetrahedral one? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps it's the blue one that's the third complex. Wait, I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Or wait, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I should proceed and see.

The problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^(2+) complex. So that's the second complex, with β2=40.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the largest, which would correspond to [Co(SCN)_3]^ something. Wait, but the order is a bit confusing because β4 is 16, which is smaller than β2 and β1. So maybe the complexes are ordered by the number of ligands. Let's see: β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, Co(II) is +2, so maybe the charge of the complexes would be:

[Co(SCN)]^+ : Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge would be 2+ + (-1) = +1? So that's a +1 charge complex. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) would be Co^2+ + 2SCN^- → 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the complex ions are as follows:

[Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is (2+) + (-1) → +1
[Co(SCN)_2]^{0} → +2 + 2*(-1) = 0
[Co(SCN)_3]^{-} → +2 + 3*(-1) = -1
[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → +2 +4*(-1)= -2

So the stability constants are for each step. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for the second, etc. But wait, the problem says β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). So that would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which seems a bit odd. But perhaps in this case, the complexes stop at four ligands, but the fourth is less stable than the third. Maybe the problem is designed that way for the sake of the question.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex is a deep blue color. But wait, according to my earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] would be neutral. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the charge wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which would have two SCN- ligands. So that would be the second complex, with β2=40.

But I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let's try to think differently. The stability constant for each step is given, so:

β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} → [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} ] / ( [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] )

Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} + SCN^- → so β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} [SCN^-] )

And β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- → β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3]^- [SCN^-] )

So each β is the step-wise formation constant. To find the concentration of each species, we can model the distribution of Co species based on the various βs and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is quite high, the complexes are likely to form extensively.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so the second complex.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the third one, but I remember that the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. Wait, but according to the earlier charge calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] would be neutral. Hmm... Or perhaps I'm mixing up the charges. Let me recheck.

Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m, the charge would be:

m = 2+ (from Co) + n*(-1) (from n SCN^- ions) = 2 - n.

So the charge of the complex depends on n.

So for n=1 → +1
n=2 → 0
n=3 → -1
n=4 → -2

So the complexes are:

n=1 → [CoSCN]^+
n=2 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0
n=3 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-
n=4 → [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

So the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral.

Now, our goal is to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to all cobalt species.

To find the percentage, I'll need to calculate the fraction of each species and sum them up, then find the percentage for n=2.

The approach is to model the system using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

The total cobalt species are:

Co^2+ → X0
[CoSCN]^+ → X1
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → X2
[Co(SCN)_3]^− → X3
[Co(SCN)_4]^{2−} → X4

The total concentration is X0 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

The [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M.

The stability constants relate the concentrations as follows:

β1 = [X1]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) → X1 = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

Similarly,

β2 = [X2]/( [X1][SCN^-] ) → X2 = β2 [X1][SCN^-]

β3 = [X3]/( [X2][SCN^-] ) → X3 = β3 [X2][SCN^-]

β4 = [X4]/( [X3][SCN^-] ) → X4 = β4 [X3][SCN^-]

But this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the distribution by considering the step-wise formation.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me try to express all the species in terms of X0.

X1 = β1 X0 [SCN^-]

X2 = β2 X1 [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 X0 [SCN^-]^2

X3 = β3 X2 [SCN^-] = β3 * β2 * β1 X0 [SCN^-]^3

X4 = β4 X3 [SCN^-] = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 X0 [SCN^-]^4

So, all species can be expressed in terms of X0.

Now, the total concentration is:

X0 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 = c = 1e-2 M.

Substituting each term,

X0 + β1 S X0 + β1 β2 S^2 X0 + β1 β2 β3 S^3 X0 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 X0 = c

Where S is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Factor out X0:

X0 [1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S^2 + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 ] = c

So,

X0 = c / [1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S^2 + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 ]

Once X0 is found, we can find all other species.

Our goal is to find X2, which is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

X2 = β1 β2 S^2 X0

So, the fraction f2 = X2 / c.

So, f2 = (β1 β2 S^2 X0 ) / c

But since X0 = c / D, where D is the denominator [1 + ... ], then f2 = (β1 β2 S^2) / D.

So,

f2 = (β1 β2 S^2) / [1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S^2 + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 ]

Let me plug in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

S = 0.1.

Compute each term in the denominator D:

Term0: 1

Term1: β1 S = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: β1 β2 S^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 S^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 → Let's compute:

9 *40=360; 360 *63 = 22680. Then 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute numerator: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

Multiply by (0.1)^4 = 0.0001 → 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the denominator D is:

1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288.

Let me add them step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the numerator for f2 is β1 β2 S^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6.

So f2= 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05555.

So f2 ≈ 5.555% → wait, but that's 5.55% of the total Co is in the X2 (dithiocyanato) form.

But wait, wait a second. That can't be right because the options given are in the 16-42% range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations for the terms in the denominator. Let me double-check each term.

Wait, for Term2: β1 β2 S^2.

β1=9, β2=40 → 9*40=360. S^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01. So 360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 S^3 → 9 *40 *63 = let's compute that again.

9 *40 is 360, 360 *63 → 360 *60 =21600, 360*3=1080 → total is 22680. S^3 is 0.1^3=0.001. So 22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 → 9*40*63*16 = ?

Compute step by step:

9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16. Let's compute 22680 *10=226800, 22680*6=136080 → total 226800 + 136080=362,880.

S^4 is 0.1^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → correct.

So the denominator D is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468 → correct.

So f2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05555, which is about 5.555%. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in my assumption about which complex is blue.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which would be X4. Let me check the fraction for X4.

f4 = (β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4 ) / D.

So numerator is 36.288, denominator D=64.468.

So f4=36.288/64.468 ≈ 0.5629 → ~56.29%. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, none of those match. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which species is the blue one.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which would be a different scenario. Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] would be neutral, not +2. So that can't be right. So maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up what the blue dithiocyanato complex is. From what I recall, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is a deep blue color. Wait, but according to the charge calculation earlier, n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I have the charge wrong.

Wait, perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which would imply that two SCN^- ions are ligands, but the charge is +2. That would mean:

Co^2+ + 2SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}

Because Co^2+ (charge +2) plus 2 SCN^- (each -1) gives a complex charge of 0. Wait, no, that's neutral. So perhaps the formula is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which would require that Co is in a higher oxidation state, but the problem states it's Co(II), so that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the complexes form. Let me think again. Maybe the complexes are different. For example, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would have Co in a higher oxidation state, but Co is given as Co^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} ion, which is a deep blue. So that would be X4, the fourth complex. So let's check f4 again.

f4 = (36.288) /64.468 ≈ 0.5629 → ~56.29%, which isn't in the options. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- → X3. Let's compute f3.

f3 = (β1 β2 β3 S^3) / D = (22.68) /64.468 ≈ 0.3517 → 35.17%. That's also not matching any options.

Wait, but maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which would have n=2 but with a different charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm numbering the complexes incorrectly. Maybe the β values correspond to the number of ligands beyond the first. For example, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ → 1 ligand, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → 2 ligands, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the complexes differently. Let me think of the complexes as having different charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are formed in a way that each β corresponds to adding a ligand to the previous complex, regardless of the charge.

Wait, perhaps the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge +1.

The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} → [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → charge 0.

The third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → charge -1.

The fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → [Co(SCN)_3}^- + SCN^- → charge -2.

So, with this setup, the β values are:

β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ][SCN^-] )

And so on.

In that case, the expressions for each X_i would be:

X1 = β1 X0 S

X2 = β2 X1 S = β1 β2 X0 S^2

X3 = β3 X2 S = β1 β2 β3 X0 S^3

X4 = β4 X3 S = β1 β2 β3 β4 X0 S^4

Wait, but this way, the denominator D would be:

D = 1 + β1 S + β1 β2 S^2 + β1 β2 β3 S^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4

Which is what I did earlier.

In that case, the fractions are as I calculated.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, but if β4 is 16, which is less than β3=63, that would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That might not make sense, but the problem says so.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the denominator D.

Compute each term:

Term0 =1

Term1=β1*S=9*0.1=0.9 → correct.

Term2=β1*β2*S^2=9*40 * 0.01=360*0.01=3.6 → correct.

Term3=β1*β2*β3*S^3=9*40*63 *0.001 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

Term4= β1*β2*β3*β4 *S^4 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880; 362880 * (0.0001) =36.288 → correct.

So D=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468 → correct.

So, in this setup, the fraction for X2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.555%. But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is a different species. Maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, but according to the charge calculation, that's not possible with Co^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which would correspond to X4, which has a fraction of 36.288/64.468≈56.3%, which isn't in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the fractions. Let me see:

Wait, for X2, the fraction is (β1 β2 S^2) / D → 3.6 /64.468≈0.0555 or ~5.55%.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN ligands, but perhaps it's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which would require that the complex has a charge of +2. But how?

Wait, if Co is in +3 oxidation state, but the problem states it's Co(II), so that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which would require that each SCN^- is -1, so two of them would make -2, and Co^2+ plus two SCN^- gives 0 total charge. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that all the Co is in the form of these complexes. But perhaps some other species are present, like Co(SCN)_n with other charges. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the dithiocyanato complex but considering it as [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} which would have n=2 but a different charge. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, perhaps the denominator should include an additional term for the hydrolysis of Co^2+ or some other factor, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think it's safe to ignore.

Wait, perhaps the β constants are given in a different way. For example, perhaps β1 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, etc. In that case, the formation constants would be cumulative.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall formation constants, not step-wise. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- etc.

In that case, the expressions would be different.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But if they are overall constants, that changes the way the concentrations are calculated.

If β1 is K1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 is K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 is K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

In that case, the concentrations would be:

X1 = β1 * X0 * S

X2 = β2 * X0 * S^2

X3 = β3 * X0 * S^3

X4 = β4 * X0 * S^4

Then, the total is X0 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 = c.

So D = 1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4.

In that case, let's compute D with the given values.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

S=0.1.

Compute each term:

1 →1

β1 S = 9 *0.1=0.9

β2 S^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

β3 S^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

β4 S^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

So D=1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 = 2.3646.

So, X0= c / D = 1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.225e-3 M.

Then, the concentration of X2 (which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}) is X2= β2 * X0 * S^2 =40 *4.225e-3 *0.01 → 40 *4.225e-5 = 1.69e-3 M.

The total Co is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction f2= X2 /c = (1.69e-3) / (1e-2) )= 0.169 → 16.9%.

Which matches option D:16.9%.

But wait, this approach assumes that the βs are overall formation constants, not step-wise.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the βs were step-wise. But perhaps in this problem, the βs are the overall stability constants.

So, if the βs are overall, then the approach would be different, and the fraction for X2 would be 16.9%, which is option D.

That makes sense because the options include 16.9% as option D.

So, the percentage would be 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]
- The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \), which is the second complex.

### Approach:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constants (\( \beta \)) represent the equilibrium formation of cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the following species:  
   \[
   \text{Co}^{2+}, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}^+], \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+}, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^-, \, [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-}
   \]
   The concentrations of these species can be expressed in terms of \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] \) using the stability constants.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the equilibrium constants and the total cobalt concentration. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   c = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^− + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-}
   \]
   Using the stability constants, the fractions of the species can be calculated as:  
   \[
   f_i = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_i [\text{SCN}^-]^i}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]

3. **Denominator Calculation**:  
   The denominator \( D \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting the given values (\( \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16, \, [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \)):  
   \[
   D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot 0.1^4)
   \]
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

4. **Fraction of \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \)**:  
   The fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D}
   \]
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{64.468} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05555
   \]
   Converting to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_2 \approx 5.55\%
   \]

5. **Revisiting the Blue Complex**:  
   Since \( 5.55\% \) does not match any of the provided options, it is likely that the blue complex corresponds to \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} \), which has a higher fraction. Recalculating for \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} \):  
   \[
   f_4 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}{D}
   \]
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   f_4 = \frac{9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4}{64.468} = \frac{36.288}{64.468} \approx 0.5629
   \]
   Converting to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_4 \approx 56.29\%
   \]

6. **Final Adjustment**:  
   The correct interpretation aligns the blue complex with \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \), and recalculating under the assumption that the stability constants are overall formation constants (not step-wise) gives:  
   \[
   D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
   \]
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]
   The fraction of \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]
   Converting to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_2 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
