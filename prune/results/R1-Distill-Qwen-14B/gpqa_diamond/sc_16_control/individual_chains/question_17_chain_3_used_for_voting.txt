Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. So the complex is CaEDTA^2- or something like that.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh right, because when EDTA is in solution, it forms a complex with Ca²+ ions, and the free [Ca²+] is much lower than the concentration of the complex. So I think this has to do with the formation constant, K, which is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in reality, EDTA is usually in its deprotonated form, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about the protons or different forms of EDTA. So I can proceed with the given K value.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Assuming that the dissociation of the complex is negligible because the K is so large (5e10), which is a big number, so the reaction mostly goes to the right. So the complex doesn't dissociate much, which means [Ca²+] is very low.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the stoichiometry. The complex is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA. So each mole of CaEDTA gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- when it dissociates. But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the change as 'x' for the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, when the complex dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But since K is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation becomes:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12.

So 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. Then x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, the calculation: 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13? Let me check.

Wait, 5e10 is 5*10^10. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Yes, that's right.

So x squared is 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Hmm, wait, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, sqrt(4e-13) would be 2 * sqrt(1e-13). Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes I might mix up the K expressions. Let me double-check the K expression. Kf is [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So with [complex] = 0.02, and [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, Kf = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7.

Yes, that seems correct. So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f \), which is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_f \) is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we let the dissociation of the complex produce \( x \) M of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Thus, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \( x \) is very small due to the large \( K_f \)),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
