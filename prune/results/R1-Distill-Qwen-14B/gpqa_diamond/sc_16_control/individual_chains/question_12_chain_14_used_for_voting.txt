Okay, let's try to solve this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. And the pion is stationary. Oh right, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But wait, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

So the rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? So I can probably treat it as massless. That should simplify things.

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So each of them will have some kinetic energy. Let me think about energy conservation here. The rest mass of the pion will convert into the rest masses of the muon and neutrino plus their kinetic energies.

So the total energy available is the rest mass of the pion. So energy before decay is just m_pi c². After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible, E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, but the neutrino is a lepton, and in beta decay processes, it's relativistic, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Let's proceed.

So applying conservation of energy:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu.

And conservation of momentum says that the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = |p_nu| c. And for the muon, E_mu^2 = (m_mu c²)^2 + (p_mu c)^2.

Hmm, maybe I should set up the equations.

Let me denote K_mu as the kinetic energy of the muon, and K_nu as the neutrino's kinetic energy.

So,

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

Wait, wait, no. Because E_mu is m_mu c² + K_mu. And E_nu is K_nu. So:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But wait, that would be adding m_mu c² twice. That can't be right because the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, which is less than twice the muon's mass (which is 105.7 MeV ×2=211.4 MeV). So that would suggest that 139.6 MeV = 211.4 MeV + something, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Oh wait, no. Because the pion is decaying into a muon and a neutrino. So the rest energy is m_pi c² = m_mu c² + m_nu c² + K_mu + K_nu.

But since m_nu is zero, m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu.

So,

K_mu + K_nu = (m_pi - m_mu) c².

But I can't directly find K_mu and K_nu from this alone. I need another equation.

The other equation comes from conservation of momentum. The magnitudes are equal, so p_mu = p_nu.

The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), right? And E_nu = p_nu c. But since p_mu = p_nu = p, we can write:

E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 )

E_nu = p c

So energy conservation:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.

Let me divide both sides by c² to make it easier. Let's let me define variables in units where c=1 for simplicity. So:

m_pi = m_mu + sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Wait, but let me write it correctly. Let me write it as:

m_pi = m_mu + sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Wait, no. That would be:

m_pi = m_mu + sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Hmm, that seems difficult to solve. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me write x = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). Then,

m_pi = m_mu + x + (x - m_mu) ?

Wait, no. Because p = x - m_mu? No, that's not correct. Hmm, perhaps I should square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, let me set up the equation again. Let me let m_pi = M, m_mu = m.

So, M = m + sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

Let me subtract m from both sides:

M - m = sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

Let me denote S = M - m.

So, S = sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

Let me isolate the sqrt term:

sqrt(p^2 + m^2) = S - p.

Now, square both sides:

p^2 + m^2 = (S - p)^2 = S² - 2 S p + p².

Simplify:

p^2 + m^2 = S² - 2 S p + p².

Cancel p^2 on both sides:

m^2 = S² - 2 S p.

So,

2 S p = S² - m^2.

p = (S² - m^2)/(2 S).

But S is M - m, so substituting:

p = [ (M - m)^2 - m^2 ] / [ 2 (M - m) ) ]

Expanding numerator:

(M - m)^2 = M² - 2 M m + m². So,

Numerator = M² - 2 M m + m² - m² = M² - 2 M m.

So,

p = ( M² - 2 M m ) / [ 2 (M - m) ) ]

Factor numerator:

M² - 2 M m = M (M - 2 m).

Wait, that can't be factored that way. Alternatively, perhaps factor out M - 2m?

Wait, let's see:

M² - 2 M m = M (M - 2 m) ?

No, because M (M - 2 m) is M² - 2 M m. Oh, right. So,

p = [ M (M - 2 m) ] / [ 2 (M - m) ) ]

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute S = M - m.

M = 139.6 MeV

m = 105.7 MeV

So, S = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Wait, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, S = M - m = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Wait, but M is 139.6, m is 105.7, so M - m is 33.9.

So, S = 33.9.

Then, back to p:

p = (S² - m²) / (2 S )

Wait, earlier I thought that p = (S² - m^2) / (2 S )

Wait, because earlier equation:

2 S p = S^2 - m^2 → p = (S^2 - m^2)/(2 S )

So,

p = [ (33.9)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) ] / ( 2 * 33.9 )

Wait, let's compute numerator:

33.9^2 = let's calculate: 34^2 is 1156, so 33.9^2 is approx 1149.21.

105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49; 2 *100 *5.7=1140. So 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So numerator: 1149.21 - 11172.49 = -9923.28.

So,

p = ( -9923.28 ) / ( 2 *33.9 ) → denominator is 67.8.

So,

p ≈ -9923.28 / 67.8 ≈ approximately -146.4 MeV/c.

Wait, but p here is in MeV/c?

Wait, but p is a magnitude, so it can't be negative. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the equation:

sqrt(p² + m^2) = S - p.

But if S is 33.9 and p is positive, then S - p must be positive because sqrt is positive.

So, S - p > 0 → p < S.

But if S is 33.9, and if p is positive, that's possible. But when I calculated p, I got a negative value. That can't be right. So probably I made a mistake in the algebra.

Let me double-check the steps.

We had:

M = m + sqrt(p^2 + m^2) + p.

Subtract m:

M - m = sqrt(p^2 + m^2) + p.

Then,

sqrt(p^2 + m^2) = (M - m) - p.

Then,

sqrt(p^2 + m^2) = S - p, where S= M -m =33.9.

Square both sides:

p^2 + m^2 = (S - p)^2 = S^2 - 2 S p + p^2.

Cancel p^2:

m^2 = S^2 - 2 S p.

Rearranged:

2 S p = S^2 - m^2.

p = (S^2 - m^2)/(2 S).

Wait, that's correct.

So plugging numbers:

S =33.9, m=105.7.

S^2 = (33.9)^2 = around 1149.21.

m^2 = (105.7)^2 =11172.49.

So,

S^2 - m^2 = 1149.21 -11172.49 = -9923.28.

Divided by 2 S = 2 *33.9 =67.8.

So,

p= (-9923.28) /67.8 ≈ -146.4 MeV/c.

Wait, that can't be. So, p is negative? But p is the magnitude, so we can't have negative. So perhaps I messed up the setup.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the sign somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, when I wrote the energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + E_mu + E_nu.

And E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2? Wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, maybe it's better to work in terms of MeV and c=1 units.

So, in terms of energy, E = pc for massless particles, and E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 for others.

Wait, but if I set c=1, then E = p for massless, and E^2 = p^2 + m^2 for others.

So, the equation becomes:

M = m + sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ) + p.

Which is the same as earlier. So solving for p gives a negative value, which is impossible.

Ah, I see the problem. The assumption is that the neutrino's momentum is p, and the muon's is also p, but perhaps their directions are opposite. Wait, but the pion is at rest, so the total momentum of the products must be zero.

So, the muon's momentum is +p, and the neutrino's is -p. So the magnitude of each is p. So, in terms of vector addition, they cancel each other.

So, when I write the equation for energy, it's correct. So why am I getting a negative p?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I assumed that the neutrino's momentum is p, but in reality, the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is p in the opposite direction. So in terms of magnitude, both have p. So p can't be negative.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the equation setup is correct, but when I plug in the numbers, since m_pi is less than 2 m_mu, the equation results in a negative p, which is impossible. So maybe the setup is incorrect.

Wait, let me compute M - m =33.9 MeV. And m = 105.7. So when I compute S^2 - m^2, it's 33.9^2 - 105.7^2 = negative, which when divided by a positive denominator gives negative p. Which is impossible.

Hmm, so that suggests that the equation is impossible to solve, which can't be the case, because the decay is happening.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. Because the muon can't have a kinetic energy that would require its total energy to be more than the pion's rest energy.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the invariant mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the muon and neutrino must add up to the pion's rest mass.

But the thing is, the muon has a rest mass, so after the decay, the available energy for kinetic energy is (M - m_mu) c^2. But since the neutrino is massless, it takes away some energy.

Wait, but perhaps I can model this as a two-body decay, where one particle is massless. Let me recall the formula for the kinetic energy in such a decay.

In two-body decay where one product is massless, the energies can be found using the following approach.

The total energy after decay is M (since the pion is at rest, its energy is its rest mass), which is partitioned into the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy and the neutrino's kinetic energy.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is all kinetic.

Another approach is to consider the fact that the muon and neutrino share the available energy, and their momenta are equal and opposite.

So, let me denote:

E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

E_nu = K_nu.

Because the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its energy is K_nu.

From conservation of energy:

M = m_mu + K_mu + K_nu.

From conservation of momentum:

p_mu = p_nu.

So, the momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The muon's momentum is p_mu = sqrt( E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 ) .

The neutrino's momentum is p_nu = E_nu.

So, since p_mu = p_nu, we have:

sqrt( E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 ) = E_nu.

But E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

And E_nu = (M - m_mu - K_mu).

So substituting:

sqrt( (m_mu + K_mu)^2 - m_mu^2 ) = M - m_mu - K_mu.

Let me square both sides:

( m_mu + K_mu )^2 - m_mu^2 = ( M - m_mu - K_mu )^2.

Expanding both sides.

Left side:

(m_mu)^2 + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 - (m_mu)^2 = 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2.

Right side:

( M - m_mu )^2 - 2 (M - m_mu) K_mu + K_mu^2.

So,

Left: 2 m_mu K + K^2.

Right: (M - m_mu)^2 - 2 (M - m_mu) K + K^2.

Set them equal:

2 m_mu K + K^2 = (M - m_mu)^2 - 2 (M - m_mu) K + K^2.

Subtract K^2 from both sides:

2 m_mu K = (M - m_mu)^2 - 2 (M - m_mu) K.

Bring all K terms to the left:

2 m_mu K + 2 (M - m_mu) K = (M - m_mu)^2.

Factor K:

K [ 2 m_mu + 2 (M - m_mu) ) ] = (M - m_mu)^2.

Simplify inside the brackets:

2 m_mu + 2 M - 2 m_mu = 2 M.

So,

K * 2 M = (M - m_mu)^2.

So,

K = (M - m_mu)^2 / (2 M )

But wait, what K does this correspond to? Because in the equation, K is the K_mu.

Wait, no. Let me check.

Wait, in the setup, E_nu = M - m_mu - K_mu.

So, the K in the equation is K_mu.

So,

K_mu = (M - m_mu)^2 / (2 M )

Wait, but let's compute that.

M = 139.6 MeV

m_mu =105.7 MeV.

So,

M - m_mu =33.9 MeV.

So,

(33.9)^2 = 1149.21.

2 M = 279.2.

So,

K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.117 MeV.

So approximately 4.12 MeV. That's for the muon's kinetic energy.

Then, the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu = M - m_mu - K_mu = 139.6 - 105.7 -4.117 = 33.9 -4.117 ≈29.783 MeV. Approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes when you square and rearrange, you might have made a mistake.

Wait, the formula I derived is K_mu = ( (M - m_mu)^2 ) / (2 M )

Which makes sense because when M is much larger than m_mu, K_mu would be about (M²)/(2 M) = M/2, which can't be right because M is 139.6, so K would be about 69 MeV, but given that M - m is 33.9, that's not the case. But in this scenario, M is not much larger than m_mu, so the formula should hold.

So with M=139.6, m_mu=105.7, M - m_mu=33.9.

(33.9)^2= 1149.21.

2*M=279.2.

1149.21 / 279.2 ≈4.117 MeV.

So yes, approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon's KE, and the neutrino's KE is 33.9 -4.117=29.783, which is about 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option is D:4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is treated as massless (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV}\)).

### Key Principles:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy of the system before decay (rest energy of the pion) equals the total energy after decay (rest energy of the muon plus kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino):  
   \[
   m_{\pi} c^2 = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Since \(c = 1\) in natural units, this simplifies to:  
   \[
   m_{\pi} = m_{\mu} + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta (\(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\)).

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2,
   \]  
   where \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} + K_{\mu}\).  
   For the neutrino (massless):  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Solving for \(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\):
From energy conservation:  
\[
K_{\nu} = m_{\pi} - m_{\mu} - K_{\mu}.
\]  
From momentum conservation (\(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\)):  
\[
p_{\mu} = \sqrt{E_{\mu}^2 - m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(m_{\mu} + K_{\mu})^2 - m_{\mu}^2}.
\]  
Substituting \(p_{\mu} = E_{\nu}\) and solving for \(K_{\mu}\):  
\[
\sqrt{(m_{\mu} + K_{\mu})^2 - m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - m_{\mu} - K_{\mu}.
\]  
Squaring both sides and simplifying:  
\[
K_{\mu} = \frac{(m_{\pi} - m_{\mu})^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
m_{\pi} - m_{\mu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV},
\]  
\[
K_{\mu} = \frac{(33.9)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\nu} = m_{\pi} - m_{\mu} - K_{\mu} = 33.9 - 4.12 \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energy of the muon is \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). This matches option **D**.
