Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with chirality, right? Chiral molecules are those that aren't superimposable on their mirror images. So they have a mirror plane but can't be flipped to match the other side. These can rotate plane-polarized light, which is why they show optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through them one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The structure is a dimethyl ester of a dicarboxylate. Wait, the substituents are attached in such a way that the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But wait, if the substituents are in positions that are symmetric, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Oh, but the biphenyl with substituents can create a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Let me think. The substituents on each ring are in symmetrical positions relative to the central bond. So, on each benzene ring, nitro at 6 and the ester groups at 2. So if the arrangement around the central bond is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Wait, but when the groups on both rings are the same, maybe the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a mirror image, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the substituents are all on the same side? Or are they in positions that cause asymmetry? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for other compounds first and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Now, does this compound have a chiral center? The central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to which groups? Let's see: the carbon is connected to -CH3, -OH, -COOCH3, and the other CH2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon. The second carbon is the middle one. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COO^- (as the acid), so the ester would be CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (the ester group),
- and another CH2... Wait, no, if it's CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3, the central carbon (position 2) has groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH. Wait, no. Let's think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (the ester group),
- and the adjacent CH from the next carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) has:

- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. The central carbon is the second carbon of propanoate. So it's connected to:

Carbon 1: CH3,

Carbon 3: COOCH3,

and two other groups: OH and CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CHO(OH)-COOCH3? No, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me draw it out mentally.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, no. Wait, the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (ester group),
- and another CH (the one next to it, but wait, that's the same as the CH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps that central carbon has four different substituents. Let's see: if the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another hydrogen? Wait, no. Because the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the next carbon, which is connected to the COOCH3. Wait, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the OH-bearing one) is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. The central carbon is CH, so it's connected to:

Left: CH3,

Right: COOCH3,

Top: OH,

and another CH from the adjacent carbon? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think in terms of bonds. The central carbon is bonded to:

- A methyl group (CH3),
- An OH group,
- The carboxylate group (COOCH3),
- And another CH (the carbon next to it, which is the one connected to COOCH3). Wait, but that would make the central carbon connected to two CH groups, which are the same. So perhaps it's CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Or maybe I'm mixing up the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH),

Carbon 2: CH2,

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propanoate is three carbons: the first is the methyl (CH3), the second is the middle carbon, and the third is the COOCH3.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (number 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and what's the fourth group? Oh, the hydrogen. Wait, no: each carbon makes four bonds. So the middle carbon has:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and another CH (from C3 again? Or wait, maybe it's a CH2 group? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon has four different groups. If so, then it would be a chiral center. So, let's see: groups would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another group. Wait, but the central carbon is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Or perhaps another hydrogen? No, because the adjacent carbon is CH2 connected to COOCH3. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a CH2 (the next carbon, which is connected to COOCH3).

Wait, but the next carbon (C3) is connected to COOCH3, so perhaps the central carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group, but that's a single substituent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a CH2? Or perhaps another CH group.

Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So, in that case, the molecule would have optical isomerism because it's chiral.

So, moving on to the next compound.

3. Benzophenone. That's a ketone with two benzene rings attached to a carbonyl group. Structure: Ph-CO-Ph. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the groups attached to the central carbon are two phenyl groups and two O's (from the carbonyl). Wait, no. The structure is Ar-CO-Ar, where Ar is aryl (benzene rings). The central carbon (the one in the ketone) has:

- Two aryl groups (Ph),
- A carbonyl group (O double bond),
- And another substituent? Wait, no. The structure is:

Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

So the central carbon is bonded to two aryl groups, the oxygen (double bond), and another hydrogen? No, wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is O double-bonded to C, which is connected to two phenyl groups. So the carbonyl carbon has:

- Two phenyl groups,
- Double bond to O,
- And that's it. Wait, that's three bonds. Oh, wait, no, the carbonyl group is R-C(=O)-R'. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, the oxygen, and has a double bond to O. So, it's only attached to three groups, but that can't be because each carbon must have four bonds. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it has two single bonds: one to each phenyl group. So, the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, the oxygen (double bond), and another single bond to what? Oh wait, no, the carbonyl group is O=C-R. So in benzophenone, the central carbon is part of the ketone group: O=C-(Ph)₂. So it's bonded to two phenyl groups and the oxygen via a double bond. Wait, but that leaves only three bonds, which is impossible. So perhaps I should think of the structure as (Ph)₂CO, which is O=C-Ph-Ph. The carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to phenyl groups. So, the groups attached are two phenyls and one O (double bond). But that's only three bonds, so there must be a fourth. Oh, wait! Maybe the carbonyl carbon also has a hydrogen attached. No, benzophenone doesn't have a hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon. Because it's (Ph)₂CO, which is (Ph)₂C=O. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. So no, no hydrogen. So that carbon has three substituents, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps benzophenone structure is Ph-C(Ph)=O. So the carbon has two phenyl groups (Ph) and a double bond to O. So, the central carbon has three substituents. But that would be three bonds, but it's supposed to have four. Oh wait, perhaps the carbonyl group is O=C-Ph, but with two phenyl groups on the same carbon. So, the structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph. Wait, no, that's the same as before. So the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. So, that leaves only three substituents. Which is not possible. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because the molecule is symmetrical. Since both substituents on the carbonyl are the same (two phenyl groups), there's a plane of symmetry, so the molecule isn't chiral. So, no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is a diacid, and fumarate is the trans isomer of the diester. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the molecule is a diester with a double bond between the two carbons. The two ester groups are on opposite sides because it's the trans (fumarate) isomer.

Now, does this molecule show optical isomerism? Well, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let's see: dimethyl fumarate (trans) would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, each ester group is attached to a CH2 group, and the double bond is between them. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in trans configuration. So, the molecule would look like:

       O
       |
O=C-OCH3
       |
CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in trans configuration. So, each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetric. Wait, because if you have a double bond with two identical groups on each side, it would have a plane of symmetry. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule would have a center of symmetry? Or a plane of symmetry? Let me think: the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2 in trans. So, each COOCH3 is on opposite sides. So, the structure would be symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond. So, it's a meso compound. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents on either side are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, in this case, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same. So, if the two substituents on each end are the same and arranged trans, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Wait, for example, if you have two identical groups on each carbon of the double bond arranged trans, the molecule would be symmetrical. So, the molecule would not be chiral because it's superimposable on its mirror image. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: if the molecule has a double bond and two identical substituents on either side, but arranged in a way that makes it asymmetric. No, in the case of fumarate, the substituents are identical and arranged trans, leading to a plane of symmetry. So, no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer. Fumarate is trans. Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, so the molecule is symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, hence no optical activity.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about fumarate. Fumarate is a meso compound. Because if you have a molecule where there's a double bond with two identical groups on either side and the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. So, for example, in fumarate, the two ester groups are arranged trans, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's a meso compound, meaning it's achiral despite having stereocenters. Wait, no. Wait, wait, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Wait, fumarate is the trans diastereomer. But for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a chiral plane. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbonyl carbons (the ones attached to ester groups) are connected to the same groups. Each is connected to an OCH3, a carbonyl group, and two CH2 groups. Hmm, no, perhaps not. Wait, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2 in trans.

Wait, wait, each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, each is connected to one COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, no, let's be precise. The structure is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Let's reconstruct it correctly.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. Wait, no, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides (trans configuration). So, the dimethyl ester would have the two methyl ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group,
- And the double bond.

Wait, but that's three substituents. Each carbon must have four bonds. Hmm, wait. Each of the two central carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3,
- One CH2 (on the other end),
- A double bond to the other carbon,
- And another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but arranged trans.

Wait, no, that would make each CH have two substituents, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but in trans conformation, wait, no. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of these central carbons is bonded to a COOH group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, maybe each is bonded to a COOH and two CH2 groups? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

   HOOC
     \
C=C
     /
   HOOC

But with the two COOH groups on opposite sides (trans).

Ah, I think I'm mixing up the structures. Let me check. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait. Wait, but butenedioic acid would have a double bond between the two middle carbons. So, for fumaric acid, it's (E)-HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So, it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the CH₂ groups. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H, but in the trans configuration.

So, when you make the dimethyl ester, it becomes:

(CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(OOCCH3), but in the trans configuration. So each CH is bonded to an OOCCH3 group on opposite sides. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's a meso compound, which is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer. So, in the cis isomer, the two ester groups would be on the same side, making the molecule chiral. But in the trans (fumarate) isomer, the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to a symmetric structure, hence no optical isomerism.

So, coming back to the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not sure about this one yet. Let's think. The structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. On each ring, there's a nitro group at position 6 (relative to the connecting bond) and a carboxylate ester (OOCR) at position 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. Now, considering the entire molecule, does it have a plane of symmetry? Because if the substituents are in symmetrical positions on each ring, the molecule might be symmetric. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. The two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. On each ring, the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to the connecting bond. Wait, position 2 on the first ring would be adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1), and position 6 is across from it (para). Similarly for the other ring. So, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, then the molecule would be achiral. But if the arrangement makes it so that the substituents are not mirror images, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. But I'm not entirely sure without drawing it.

Let me think again. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other (para). So, for each ring, substituents are in para positions. So, the biphenyl molecule would have substituents in such a way that each ring's substituents are aligned in a particular way. But considering the entire molecule, the arrangement might not be symmetrical. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Or maybe it's not.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule is symmetrical, it's not chiral. For example, if the substitution pattern is such that the molecule can be divided by a plane into mirror images, then it's achiral. If not, it's chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. On each ring, the substituents are in the para positions relative to the connecting bond. So, each ring has two substituents across from each other. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central bond. So, the substituents on each ring are mirror images across that plane. So, the entire molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the nitro groups are in positions that break the symmetry. Let's imagine the two rings. Each has a nitro at 6 and a ester at 2. The nitro and ester are on opposite sides of the ring relative to the central bond. So, for each ring, the substituents are in positions that are mirror images across the central bond. So, the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait another thing: the substituents on each ring could be arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack symmetry. For example, if the ester and nitro groups are in the same orientation on each ring, but their positions relative to each other are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical. But given that they are para to each other on each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

So, perhaps compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, the question is: does this compound have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically on each benzene ring, then yes. So, considering the biphenyl structure, each ring's substituents are in positions that are mirrored across the central bond, so the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral.

So, compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, let's reevaluate the four compounds:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Earlier thought was that it has a chiral center, so yes to optical isomerism.
3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.
4. Dimethyl fumarate: Earlier thought was that it's a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake with compound 4? Because if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, it doesn't have optical isomerism. But what about the possibility of it having geometric isomerism? Well, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

So, the only compound that has optical isomerism is compound 2.

But wait, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options list only 2. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. Its structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, with the ester groups on opposite sides. So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Let me check again:

Which compounds have optical isomerism?

1. No
2. Yes
3. No
4. No

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But in the options, none have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 2.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Let me re-examine that.

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and another CH (from C3).

Wait, the central carbon is connected to:

CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group. Wait, but the adjacent carbon is CH, which is attached to COOCH3. So, the central carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon, which is connected to COOCH3).

Wait, but that would make four substituents, but are they all different?

Let me list them:

1. CH3 (from the left),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (on the right),
4. And the adjacent carbon, which is connected to COOCH3. Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is the same as the COOCH3 group. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to count the substituents.

In CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3:

The central carbon (CH(OH)) has:

- A methyl group (CH3),
- An OH group,
- A carbonyl group connected to OCH3 (COOCH3),
- And a CH2 group? No, because the next carbon is connected to the COOCH3, so it's a CH2 group.

Wait, no, the next carbon is the one attached to COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and another CH2 (from the next carbon? Or is that the same as the COOCH3 group? I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is bonded to:

- A methyl group (CH3),
- A hydroxyl group (OH),
- An ester group (OOCR),
- And another hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make four substituents. Wait, no, the central carbon would have four bonds: two single bonds (to CH3 and OH), a single bond to COOCH3, and another single bond to the adjacent carbon (which is the one connected to COOCH3). Wait, that adjacent carbon is the same as the COOCH3 group. Hmm, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon, which is the one attached to COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps that adjacent carbon is a CH2 group. So, the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and CH2.

Wait, if the substituents are all different, then the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but if two substituents are the same, then it's not chiral. In this case, the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2 (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, but in reality, the adjacent carbon is connected to the COOCH3, so the substituent is a CH2 group. So, all four substituents are different. Thus, the central carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of showing optical isomerism. So, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, from the four compounds, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about another compound. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, does exhibit optical isomerism. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would have a center of symmetry. Wait, no. Because the two substituents on each carbon are the same. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH3 (if it's CH2=... wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2 in trans.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)₂ in the trans configuration. So, each of the two central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but that would make each carbon have two identical substituents, leading to a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be symmetrical and hence not chiral.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions relative to the connecting bond. So, the nitro groups are at 6, and the ester groups are at 2 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. Now, the biphenyl structure is connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the substituents on each ring are in positions that are across from each other (para). Now, considering the entire molecule, does it have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral.

But wait, if the substituents are all in positions that make the entire molecule asymmetric, then it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the central bond. Because each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are mirror images across the central bond. So, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (which includes 1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2).

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of compound 4. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, is it a meso compound?

Wait, a meso compound has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters, but the meso form is achiral.

So, if dimethyl fumarate has stereocenters but is a meso compound, it wouldn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereocenters. Let me think: in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, each ester group is attached to a carbon in the trans configuration. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, but in that case, each carbon may not be a stereocenter because the substituents are not four different groups.

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to:

- One COOCH3,
- One CH2 group,
- And the double bond.

Wait, that's three substituents. So, each carbon can't be a stereocenter because it's only bonded to three different groups. So, no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But wait, looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → No, because 1 and 4 don't.
B) 3 and 4 → No.
C) 2 and 3 → No, 3 doesn't.
D) 1 and 2 → No, 1 doesn't.

Hmm, none of the options fit. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Let me think again about compound 1. Could it be that the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral?

If the molecule is symmetrical, then no. If not, then yes.

Each benzene ring in compound 1 has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. So, each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6. Now, considering the entire molecule, the positions of the substituents could be arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement causes the substituents to be in a non-symmetrical way. For example, if the nitro and ester groups are on the same side of the central bond on one ring, but on opposite sides on the other ring. But no, because the substituents are in the same positions on each ring. So, they would mirror each other across the central bond.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. If not, it's chiral.

In this case, each ring's substituents are in positions that are mirror images across the central bond. So, the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So, perhaps the question is wrong, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me consider the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality. So, unless the molecule has a chiral center or is a chiral molecule, it won't show optical isomerism.

Another possibility: perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me think again. Suppose the biphenyl structure has substituents in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of each ring relative to the central bond, causing the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So, on each ring, the substituents are para to each other. So, for each ring, the substituents are arranged in a way that they are mirror images across the central bond. So, the entire molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans isomer. So, in maleate, the substituents are on the same side, making the molecule chiral. But in fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, making it a meso compound, hence achiral.

Wait, so if the question is about which of the four compounds show optical isomerism, then only compound 2 and any others that might have it. But according to the options, perhaps option A is incorrect and I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism, but compound 1 might. Let me think again about compound 1.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. But how?

Each substituent on each ring is at 2 and 6 positions, which are para. So, for each ring, the substituents are across from each other. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, the only compound exhibiting optical isomerism is 2.

But none of the options have that. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which is a meso compound. Therefore, it's achiral.

So, the only correct compounds showing optical isomerism are 2. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct option is A) 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 1 and 4 are correct, so I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it's chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to each other, causing no plane of symmetry.

Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across from each other. So, the molecule would be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, the nitro groups are on the same side, and the ester groups are on the same side, but in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

But given that each ring's substituents are in para positions, I think the molecule is symmetric.

So, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

From my analysis, only 2 is correct. But it's not an option. So perhaps the mistake is that I thought 2 has a chiral center, but it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps 2 doesn't have a chiral center. Let me reevaluate compound 2.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (which is the same as the COOCH3 group?).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, but that can't be because that would make four substituents. Alternatively, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, if it's attached to a hydrogen, then the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. In that case, the substituents are all different, making it a chiral center. So, yes, it would have optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option would need to include 2. Looking at the options, option A includes 2, as do options D and A.

Wait, but according to my initial analysis, compounds 1 and 4 don't show optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1, 2 and 4, but I don't think 1 and 4 do. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about 4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism. Let me think: if the molecule is asymmetrical, it would have optical isomers. But I thought it's a meso compound.

Wait, maybe it's not a meso compound. Let me think: in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, so the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should make a decision based on the analysis.

So, the correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. However, none of the options match that. Therefore, perhaps the correct option is A) 1, 2, and 4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think: if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral, then it would show optical isomerism.

But I'm not confident about that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but that would imply that 1 and 4 have optical isomerism, which I don't think they do.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A.

But this isn't making sense. I think I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center. Let me think: the biphenyl structure might have substituents arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents on each ring are such that one is on the same side as the other ring's substituent, leading to an overall asymmetry.

But without a clear image, it's hard to say. However, I think the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct option is A, which includes 2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A) 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the analysis that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A) 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does show optical isomerism. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

If the molecule is not symmetrical, it would be chiral. But I thought it's a meso compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't a meso compound. Let me think: in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, each ester is on a different carbon, and they're trans. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, hence achiral.

So, I'm confident that the only correct answer is compound 2. But since the options don't have that, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate, being the trans isomer, is a meso compound. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 3. Let me think again about benzophenone.

Benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to oxygen. So, it's not a chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is compound 2.

But none of the options match. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me list the compounds:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Yes.
3. No.
4. No.

So, only 2 is correct. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. If dimethyl fumarate is a cis isomer, then it's chiral. But I thought it's the trans isomer.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to fumarate as the cis isomer. No, fumarate is the trans isomer.

So, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 has two chiral centers. Let me think about the structure again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)₂. Each of the two central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each carbon is bonded to:

- One COOCH3,
- One CH2 group,
- And the double bond.

So, each carbon has three substituents, not four. Hence, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

So, going back, the only correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate being a meso compound. Let me think: if the molecule has two identical substituents on either side of the double bond, arranged trans, it's a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I think the correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

However, based on my analysis, I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. Therefore, perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but I must choose the best possible answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something about compound 4. Let me think again: could it have a chiral center?

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each carbon has three substituents. Hence, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is compound 2. But since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll have to go with the option that includes compound 2, which is option A, but I'm not sure.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) are in para positions relative to the connecting bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exhibit optical isomerism.  
   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups, and the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is (E)-CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical and classified as a meso compound, meaning it is achiral despite having stereoisomerism.
