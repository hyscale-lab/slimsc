Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax value. Right, because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and it's the apparent shift in position as seen from Earth's orbit. So if a star is nearby, it moves more against the background, giving a larger parallax.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I think it means that their spatial density is uniform in space. So, the number of stars in any region doesn't depend on how far away that region is. That is, the number density n is constant throughout space. So, more stars would be found in larger volumes, but the density itself doesn't change with distance.

Wait, but that's in real space. How does this translate to the parallax space? Parallax and distance are inversely related. So if I consider the number of stars within a certain range of parallax, how does that number depend on parallax?

Let me think. The parallax (plx) is related to distance (d) by the formula plx = 1/d (in parsecs, I think). Or wait, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

If I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in distance terms? Let's see. The parallax decreases as distance increases. So if plx is small, the star is far away. So, the range of plx from plx to plx + dplx would correspond to a decrease in distance from d to d - dd, where dd is the change in distance.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of differential elements. Let me try to model this mathematically.

We want to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dplx) as a function of plx.

Given that the number density of stars n is constant, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

But how do I relate the volume element in space to the parallax?

Let me consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dd. Because it's a spherical shell, the volume is surface area (4πd²) times thickness (dd).

But since the parallax plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = -d(plx)^-2 d(plx). Wait, let me compute that.

d = 1/plx
dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)

So, the volume element dV = 4π d² dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -(1/plx²) d plx:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx )

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me write it step by step.

dV = 4π d² dd
= 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx²) d plx)
= 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² ) d plx
= -4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're looking for the number of stars per unit parallax range, maybe we can take the absolute value or consider the positive aspect.

So the number of stars in that volume element is n*dV = n * (-4π / plx^4 ) d plx. Hmm, negative because as plx increases, the shell volume decreases. But for the count, we can say the number dN is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but wait a second. The differential dN is the number of stars in that thin shell when plx varies by d plx. So, dN = n * dV.

So, dN = n * 4π d² dd.

But since we need this in terms of plx, let's substitute d = 1/plx and find dd in terms of d plx.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Substituting into dV:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx )

So,

dV = -4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

But since dN is a positive quantity, the negative indicates the direction of change, but for the magnitude, we can ignore the sign.

So,

dN = n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

Wait, no, because dV is negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value. So,

dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

Hence, the number of stars per unit range of plx is dN/d plx = n * 4π / plx^4.

So, the density of stars in terms of parallax would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean that as plx increases (i.e., as stars get closer), the number per unit plx increases as 1/plx^4. So for a fixed range in plx (like 1 to 2 arcseconds), the number of stars would be higher because they are closer and more densely packed in parallax space.

But wait, the question is about how the number per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, the number per unit plx is dN/d plx, which is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, dV = 4π d² dd.

dd is the change in distance, which is negative of (1/plx²) d plx.

So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx )

= -4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars is dN = n * dV = n * (-4π / plx^4) d plx.

But since we're considering the absolute number, it's 4π n / plx^4 * d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is (dN)/(d plx) = (4 π n) / plx^4.

So, number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Which suggests that the correct answer is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that for volume in 3D, the number of stars would depend on 1/plx^3, but perhaps I'm mixing up the dependencies.

Wait, another approach: considering that the number density is uniform, which means that the number of stars in a volume V is n * V.

The volume element in terms of distance is a spherical shell: 4π d² dd.

So, for a given parallax plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting d and dd into the volume element:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx )

= -4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, V is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the number of stars dN in this shell is n * dV = n * (-4π / plx^4) d plx.

So, dN = (4 π n ) / plx^4 * d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is dN/d plx = (4 π n ) / plx^4.

Which suggests that the number per unit plx changes as 1/plx^4.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me consider a uniform distribution in real space (number density n is constant). The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is dN = n * 4 π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, wait, why? Because the volume element is 4 π d² dd, and d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dd = (d plx) * (-1/plx²). So, the volume is 4 π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/plx^2 d plx ). So that's 4 π (-1/plx^4) d plx.

But the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but for the magnitude, it's positive. So, dV = 4 π / plx^4 d plx.

So, the number of stars in this shell is n * dV = (4 π n / plx^4) d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is 4 π n / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct answer would be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought for a uniform distribution in real space, the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so the number of stars in a shell at distance d would be proportional to d^2 * dd. But when converting to parallax, which is 1/d, perhaps the scaling changes differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the volume per unit parallax.

Wait, perhaps I can model it using the fact that the number of stars in a certain distance range is proportional to the volume of the shell at that distance multiplied by the number density.

But since the number density n is constant, the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd is n * 4 π d² dd.

So, the number per unit distance is n * 4 π d².

Now, to find the number per unit parallax, we can make a substitution. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Substituting into the expression:

Number per unit distance is n *4 π (1/plx)^2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number per unit plx. So, how does the number per unit plx relate to the number per unit distance?

Well, the number of stars per unit plx is the number per unit distance multiplied by the derivative of distance with respect to plx.

Wait, that's probably a better way to think about it. Because the number per unit plx is the number per unit distance multiplied by the change in distance per change in plx.

So, number per unit plx = (number per unit distance) * (dd/d plx).

Hmm, so number per unit distance is n * 4 π d².

And dd/d plx is the derivative of d with respect to plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd/d plx = -1/plx².

So, number per unit plx = [n *4 π d² ] * ( - 1/plx² )

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx².

Substituting:

number per unit plx = [n *4 π (1/plx²) ] * ( -1/plx² )

= -4 π n / plx^4.

Since we're looking for the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign.

So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which again suggests option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density \( n \) is constant. The parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to the distance \( d \), i.e., \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density \( n \). The volume of the shell is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = 1/\text{plx} \) and \( dd = - (1/\text{plx}^2) d\text{plx} \), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
dN = n \, dV = n \left(-\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, as \( \text{plx} \) increases (i.e., as stars move farther away), the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases more steeply than any other power of \( \text{plx} \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
