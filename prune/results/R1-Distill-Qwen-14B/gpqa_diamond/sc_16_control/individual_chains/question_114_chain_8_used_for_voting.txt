Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, each involving a reaction. I need to figure out the reagents A and B from the options provided.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's methylacetone or something. NaCN is sodium cyanide. Hmm, what reactions do ketones typically undergo with cyanide? Oh, I think I remember something about nucleophilic addition to ketones. Oh wait, the cyanide ion acting as a nucleophile adding to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. Right! The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alcohol. So, the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. That's exactly what's happening here. So butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives that cyanohydrin.

But wait, what's reagent A? The reaction conditions are important. I think the formation of cyanohydrin typically happens under acidic conditions. Because the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic. So, the cyanide ion can attack more easily when the carbonyl is protonated.

So, A is the acid that provides the H+ for protonation. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or maybe something else. The options for A in the choices are H3O+ or NaHSO3 in options C and D.

Wait, what's the role of NaHSO3? Sodium bisulfite is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like in the bisulfite addition test for ketones. But in this case, we're adding cyanide, not reducing the ketone. So for the cyanohydrin formation, we need an acid catalyst. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Wait, but in the first reaction, what is the role of A? The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the acid, so H3O+ would be option A, B, or C's A is H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, if A is H3O+ or maybe another acid, but the options for A are:

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So the first reaction's A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but wait. Cyanide addition to ketones usually is done under acidic conditions, like with HCl or H2SO4 as catalysts. So maybe A is H3O+ (like from HCl, but that's not in the options for A). Or maybe it's a strong acid. Alternatively, could it be NaHSO3? No, I think NaHSO3 is a weaker acid and is more commonly used in bisulfite reactions, which are different.

Alternatively, wait, maybe A is not the acid but something else. Or perhaps the reaction uses NaCN as the cyanide source, and then some acid is added as a catalyst, which is A here.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ (acid) → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (cyanohydrin). That makes sense. So A is H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

What conditions do that? Oh, I think there's a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either strong acid (like HCl) and heat, or in the presence of a strong base like NaOH followed by acid work-up.

Wait, so for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you can have acidic hydrolysis or basic. Let me think. The product is a carboxylic acid. In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O, but more likely, the conditions are acid or base.

Wait, but the reagent given in the reaction is B, and the reaction is with H2O. So probably, the reagent is a solution with H2O and an acid or a base.

So, the starting material is a nitrile with an alcohol group on the same carbon. When the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So under acidic conditions, nitrile hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, how does that happen? The acidic hydrolysis of nitriles usually involves concentrated H2SO4. Alternatively, it can be done with HCl in the presence of water and heat. So for the second step, reagent B is either HCl or something else. The product is a carboxylic acid, so B should be an acid catalyst.

Looking at the options, B is either HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). So which is the correct one?

Wait, the reagent is written as B (H2O), so perhaps B is the solution used, like aqueous HCl or aqueous H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe it's another condition.

Wait, another point: the first reaction's product is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Then, in the second reaction, the nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid. But if the alcohol is on the same carbon as the nitrile, how would that hydrolysis work? Because when nitriles are hydrolyzed, they can form amides, or acids under certain conditions.

Wait, maybe the presence of the alcohol affects the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis in acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, if the reagent is H2O and B, so for example, if B is HCl, then it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. If B is CH3COOH, then it's a weak acid.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically uses strong acid conditions. For example, HCl in aqueous solution with heat. Alternatively, using H2SO4 and heat. So, for B, which is the reagent, if it's HCl, that would fit. So B is HCl.

Looking back to our options, options A and C have B as HCl. Let's see their A's.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

In the first reaction, A is H3O+ (acid) for the cyanohydrin formation. So for the first reaction, A is correct as H3O+.

So option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. So that's a possible correct choice.

Wait, but what about option B and D?

Wait, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that's correct. So options A and B have A as H3O+. So options A and B are possible candidates.

Now, in the second reaction, B has to be HCl. So between options A and C, which have B as HCl.

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, which is correct, then option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So that would be the correct option.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the second reaction. The product is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires strong acid conditions.

Alternatively, sometimes the nitrile is first converted to an amide under basic conditions, then treated with acid to form the carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, the standard hydrolysis of nitriles with HCl and H2O would produce a carboxylic acid. So for the second reaction, B is HCl, which is option A or C.

But we know that in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (from HCl or another acid), so if A is H3O+, which is in option A, then the second reaction uses HCl as B.

Wait, wait, but if the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, then during the reaction, H3O+ would come from an acid like HCl. But in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (protons), perhaps from a solution of HCl, but the question says A is the reagent. Oh, wait, the question says the reagents are NaCN, A, and B.

Wait, no. Let me look back.

The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

So, the reagents are NaCN and A. So A is the acid, perhaps HCl (as H3O+ comes from HCl), but in the options, A is H3O+.

Alternatively, maybe A is H2SO4, which would provide H+.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps after adding NaCN and acid (H3O+), the first reaction forms the cyanohydrin.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, then A would be H3O+.

Then, the second reaction uses HCl (B) to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

So the correct option would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but in the options, option A is that. So that would be the right choice.

Alternatively, if NaHSO3 is used in A, which is a weaker acid, would that work for the cyanohydrin? I'm not sure. I think that the formation of cyanohydrin requires an acid catalyst, so H3O+ is more likely.

So putting it together, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion. The formation of the product, a cyanohydrin, typically requires an acidic catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion.  
   - Among the options, reagent A must be an acid. H₃O⁺ is the most suitable choice for this reaction, as it provides the necessary protons for the acid-catalyzed mechanism.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-Benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acid conditions, such as HCl.  
   - Among the options, reagent B must be HCl, as it provides the acidic environment necessary for the hydrolysis.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Correct for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1, and HCl is suitable for the hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect for Reaction 2. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - Incorrect for Reaction 1. NaHSO₃ is not a strong enough acid to catalyze the formation of a cyanohydrin effectively.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect for both reactions. NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is unsuitable for Reaction 2.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
