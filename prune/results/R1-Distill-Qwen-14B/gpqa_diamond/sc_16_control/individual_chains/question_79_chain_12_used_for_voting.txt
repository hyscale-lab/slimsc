Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and we have to figure out what compound X was. The options are A to D, all epoxides it seems.

First, I need to recall what 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Wait, wait, but actually, I think it's more often used in the formation of epoxides. Or maybe it's for opening epoxides in specific conditions. Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. The solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is 403 K, which is pretty high. Oh wait, it's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base, like a strong, bulky base. Oh right! The reaction is probably a ring-opening of an epoxide because when an epoxide is treated with a strong base like this, it can open the epoxide in a certain way. Or wait, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, no, another thought. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually used in the formation of epoxides from carbonyl groups. Like, it's a catalyst in the Prilezhaev oxidation, where a ketone is oxidized to an epoxide with an oxidizing agent like hydrogen peroxide. So maybe in this case, compound X is not the epoxide, but something that forms an epoxide upon reaction. Wait, but if X is the starting material, and the reaction forms the epoxide, but the product's NMR is given. Hmm, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, wait. The product's NMR is given, so the product is an epoxide because the options are all epoxides. So maybe the reaction is opening an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide from a carbonyl. Let me think.

Wait, the product has an epoxide structure because all the options are epoxides. So if the reaction is using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, perhaps it's an acid catalyzed opening, but that's not right because 1,4-diazabicyclo is a base. Or maybe it's a ring-opening under basic conditions.

But then, the question is about the product. Wait, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm more confused now. Alternatively, perhaps compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is doing something else. Wait, but the product is an epoxide because the options are all epoxides. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data. The product's 1H NMR and 13C NMR are given. So the product is an epoxide, and we need to figure out what the starting material was that upon reaction (with this reagent) gives this product.

Wait, no, actually, the reaction is of compound X to give the product. So X is the starting material, and the product is the epoxide. So the question is, what is X that when reacted with this reagent gives an epoxide with the given NMR.

Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base and can be used to form epoxides from carbonyl groups. For example, if X is a ketone, then the reaction with this reagent in presence of an oxidizing agent would form an epoxide. Alternatively, another possibility is that X is a diene, and the reagent is used in some way to form an epoxide, but I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the opening of an epoxide. If X is an epoxide, and the reagent is a base, perhaps it's opening the epoxide in a ring-opening reaction, but the product would then be something else, not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The product is an epoxide, because the options are all epoxides. So X must have been a compound that, when treated with this reagent, forms an epoxide.

So, what's the structure of the product? Let's look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So there are two singlets at around 2.3 ppm, each integrating for 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like being attached to electronegative atoms or in symmetric positions. Maybe each is attached to an oxygen, such as in an epoxide where each oxygen is attached to a CH2 or something else. Wait, but epoxide is an oxygen connected to two carbons. Alternatively, perhaps they're attached to carbonyls, but then they would be more deshielded.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the epoxide is part of a styrene structure, maybe like a vinylcyclohexane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the two methyl groups could be on adjacent carbons in the ring. Let me think about the 13C NMR.

13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, that 197 ppm is a very high chemical shift. That's indicative of a ketone group (around 205-220 ppm) but wait, if the product is an epoxide, why is there a carbonyl? Or maybe it's an ester or another group. Wait, but the 197.7 is a singlet, so it's a single carbon. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 197.7 is an epoxide. No, epoxide carbons are usually in the 60-70 ppm range. Wait, no, let me recall. Epoxide carbons are typically deshielded but not that high. Wait, maybe not. Let me check. Oh right, the carbons in an epoxide are typically around 50-60 ppm. So 197 is way higher, so it's not an epoxide carbon.

So perhaps the product is not an epoxide, but what else? Wait, but the options are all epoxides. So perhaps the product is the epoxide, and the NMR data includes other groups.

Wait, but the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone, but that's conflicting with the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the options again. All the options are epoxides. So the product must be an epoxide. But the 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. That's confusing. Unless the product is an epoxide with a ketone group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide with a ketone substituent. So, maybe the starting material was a carbonyl group, and the reaction formed an epoxide adjacent to it.

Wait, let me think. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base. So, perhaps X is a carbonyl, such as a ketone, and the reaction forms an epoxide via an epoxidation. So X is a ketone, and the product is an epoxide with a ketone group.

Wait, but how? Oh, wait, I think that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used in the oxidation of ketones to epoxides using hydrogen peroxide. So the Prilezhaev oxidation. So for example, a ketone like cyclohexanone would be oxidized to form an epoxide, cyclohexene oxide, but with more substituted groups, perhaps.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has the formula C11H12O. So when oxidized, it becomes an epoxide, which would have the same number of carbons, but perhaps the O increases? Wait, no, wait: the formula of compound X is C11H12O. Let's see, the product, if it's an epoxide, would have an oxygen in the epoxide (each epoxide is O), but where else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide with another O in a carbonyl group. So, for example, if X is a ketone, the product would be an epoxide adjacent to the ketone. So the product would have two oxygen atoms: one in the epoxide and one in the ketone.

Wait, but let's look at the molecular formula. X is C11H12O. If X is oxidized to form an epoxide, which adds an oxygen, then the product would be C11H10O2. But the options are all C11H12O. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't oxidation. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening. If X is an epoxide, and the reagent opens it. But then, what would be the product? That would probably break the epoxide ring, leading to a diol or something else, but the product would no longer be an epoxide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's analyze the NMR data of the product.

In the 1H NMR, we have a singlet at 2.28 ppm for 3H and another at 2.31 ppm for 3H. So two methyl groups. Then, there's a doublet at 6.75, and then more doublets in the aromatic region.

Wait, the aromatic region has a 1H doublet at 6.75, 2H doublet at 7.08, 1H doublet at 7.68, and 2H doublet at 7.71. So four peaks in the aromatic region. Let me think: for a para-substituted benzene ring, you'd typically have two doublets. But here, we have four peaks, which suggests maybe a more complex substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. For example, a styrene group would have a trans coupling between the vinyl protons and the aromatic protons. Let me think about the coupling.

Wait, the aromatic signals: 7.08 (2H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). These look like two doublets with the same coupling, perhaps for a para-substituted benzene. The H at 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) might be part of a vinyl group attached to the benzene.

So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that is an epoxide attached to a vinyl group. For example, something like styrene oxide. But let me think.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product has a ketone group. But if it's an epoxide, the carbonyl would be part of another functional group.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to draw the structure based on the NMR data.

So, the 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So two methyl groups, each attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Maybe each methyl is attached to an oxygen, like OCH3, but those are usually around 3.3 ppm. Wait, but 2.3 ppm is more like a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom or perhaps a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are attached to carbons adjacent to oxygen, like in an epoxide. For example, in an epoxide, each oxygen is connected to two carbons. So if those carbons each have a methyl group, that would account for the two singlets.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, the carbons:

21.3 and 28.4 are both quaternary carbons (s), but wait the 21.3 is a singlet for 1C, and 28.4 for 1C. So maybe these are the two carbons in the epoxide ring. The other carbons are the aromatic carbons and others.

Wait, but the 13C NMR also shows a carbonyl at 197.7, which is a singlet. So that's a carbonyl carbon. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, because the options are epoxides.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product has an epoxide ring and a ketone group. But that would require two oxygens, but the product's molecular formula from the options is C11H12O. Wait, but let me check: the product's formula, if X is C11H12O and the reaction adds an oxygen, but perhaps not. Hmm, no, maybe the reaction is not adding oxygen but changing structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given and see which one would fit the NMR data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

So all are epoxides, with substituents on the epoxide ring.

Let me think about each option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide where the oxygen is between two carbons, one of which is attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C
     |
     CH2-CH2-(benzene)

Wait, no, styryl is CH2=CH-Ph. So if it's 2-styrylepoxide, the structure is O-C-O connected to a CH2-CH2-Ph? Wait, no, wait. Styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-O. Wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, styryl is the vinyl group attached to benzene. So styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-. No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, actually, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2.

Wait, no. Styryl is the vinyl benzene group: benzene ring attached to a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-O, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between the two carbons of the styryl. For example, the epoxide would have the two oxygen-connected carbons as part of a CH2-CH2 group, but that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between the two carbons of the styryl. So the structure would be: the epoxide is between the two carbons of the styryl group. So O connected to two CH2 groups, each attached to the benzene. So that would be a 1,2-epoxy group in the styryl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
  CH2 CH2
      |
      Ph

Wait, but that's not a styryl group. Styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. So if it's a styrylepoxide, perhaps the structure is O connected to the two carbons of the double bond. So O
||
C-O-C with each C connected to a benzene?

Wait, no, that would make a four-membered ring. Wait, no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
  CH2 Ph

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between the two carbons of the styryl group, making it a three-membered ring with the oxygen.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data again.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

The aromatic protons are at 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). That suggests that the aromatic ring has substituents that split the protons into these patterns.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that is a vinyl group attached to an epoxide. So, the benzene has a substituent at the para position which is a CH2-O-CH2 group with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-O-CH2-CH2 group? No, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH3

But wait, that would be an ether. But we need an epoxide, so perhaps:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen, but that's not an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic epoxide with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that is a vinyl group, and the vinyl group is part of an epoxide.

Let me think about the 1H NMR again. The two singlet methyl groups (2.28 and 2.31) would be on adjacent carbons each attached to oxygen in the epoxide. So, perhaps the epoxide is between two carbons, each with a methyl group.

Wait, so the epoxide is O connected to C(CH3)-O-C(CH3). But wait, that would make a four-membered ring, which is not possible. No, epoxide is a three-membered ring. So perhaps each of the two carbons in the epoxide has a methyl group attached to them.

So the structure would be:

CH3-O-C-O-CH3

Wait, but that's not possible because the epoxide is a three-membered ring. Oh, wait, no, the epoxide is O connected to two carbons. So each of these carbons has a methyl group. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-O-C(CH3)

But that's a four-membered ring, which isn't an epoxide. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, but not part of the epoxide. So the epoxide is between two carbons, each of which has a methyl group. For example:

CH2(O)-CH2- with each CH2 having a methyl substituent.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's look at the 13C NMR. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So the product is an epoxide with a ketone group.

But how can that be? Because the starting material is C11H12O, and the product would have more oxygens if that's the case. But the options are all C11H12O, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the 197.7 ppm is not a carbonyl. Could it be another type of carbon? Oh, wait, maybe it's an ester carbonyl, but then the formula would have an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is an aldehyde carbon, but aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm, which isn't in the 1H NMR. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 197.7 is an acetylenic carbon, but those are usually around 70-100 ppm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me recount the 13C NMR:

The 13C NMR has 9 signals. The two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. Then, 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C), and 197.7 (1C).

Hmm, 21.3 and 28.4 are likely to be CH3 groups attached to something. The high value (28.4) suggests maybe a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom, like O. Wait, but CH3-O is usually around 50 ppm for the O-bearing carbon, but the CH3 itself is around 20-30 ppm, which matches 21.3 and 28.4.

Wait, maybe the two methyl groups are attached to two different carbons, each adjacent to an oxygen. Like in a structure where the epoxide has two adjacent carbons each bearing a methyl group.

So, the epoxide would be O-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-O. No, that can't be because the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so it's O-C-C-O. So each C in the epoxide has two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-C(CH3)

But that would require the two carbons to each have a methyl and be connected to each other and the oxygen. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)

Wait, but that's not an epoxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger structure. Let me think about the options.

Option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So it's an epoxide with substituents at positions 2 and 3. The styryl group is attached to the 3 position, and there's a methyl at 2.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
 CH3  styryl group

Wait, but the styryl group is a vinyl benzene. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
CH3   CH2-Ph

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
CH3   CH2-CH2-Ph

But that would make the epoxide connected to a propyl group, which is substituted with a benzene. Hmm, but the NMR might show signals accordingly.

Wait, but let's think about the 1H NMR of option C. If it's 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, the structure would have a methyl group attached to one carbon of the epoxide and a styryl group attached to the other.

So the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-...

Wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-O? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
 CH3   CH2-Ph

Wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-, so maybe the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
 CH3   CH2-CH2-Ph

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH(CH3)-O ?

No, that's not an epoxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-CH(CH3). But that's getting complicated.

Maybe I should consider each option and their expected NMR.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is between the two carbons of the styryl group. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-Ph

No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O, but that's an ether, not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-CH3. No, that's not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O, but with the oxygen in the epoxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the number of signals in the NMR.

In the 1H NMR, there are 6 signals: two methyl singlets, and four aromatic signals. The 13C NMR has 9 signals: two methyl, then 6 aromatic carbons (since 2+2+1+2+1+1=9?), but wait, let's see:

The 13C NMR has 21.3 (1C), 28.4 (1C), 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C), 197.7 (1C).

So that's 9 carbons, which matches the formula C11H12O. Because 11 carbons in the structure.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone group. But how does that fit with the options being epoxides? Because the options don't have a ketone. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide. Hmm, but the options are all epoxides.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl as part of an epoxide ring. But that's not possible because epoxide carbons are in the 50-70 range.

Wait, maybe the 197.7 is a carbonyl in a ketone group, but then the product must have a carbonyl and an epoxide. But the formula would be C11H10O2, but the options are C11H12O.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is not a carbonyl. Maybe it's an oxygenated carbon, like an epoxide carbon. Wait, but earlier I thought that epoxide carbons are around 50-60 ppm. Let me double-check. Wait, I think that epoxide carbons can be around 60-70 ppm. So 197 is way higher; that must be a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a carbonyl compound. But the options are all epoxides. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl that is part of the epoxide. But I don't think that's possible because epoxides don't have carbonyl groups. So maybe the product is a different structure.

Wait, maybe the 197.7 is part of a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. So perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond.

But again, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the number of hydrogen signals and see which option fits.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has four signals: two doublets for 2H each, and two doublets for 1H each. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause the splitting.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, you typically have two sets of peaks: the para-substituent leads to two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So, for example, if the substituent is -OCH2CH2Ph, then you would have peaks for the ortho, meta, and para positions. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents on adjacent carbons, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another idea: maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that is a vinyl group, leading to coupling between the vinyl protons and the aromatic protons. So the vinyl would have a trans coupling, causing the doublets in the aromatic region.

Let me think about the 1H NMR again. The peaks at 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) could be the para-substituted benzene, and the peaks at 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) could be the vinyl protons.

Wait, but in a vinyl group, the protons are split into a doublet of doublets, but in this case, each is a doublet. So maybe each vinyl proton is coupled to only one other proton, like in a trans configuration where each is coupled to an aromatic proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of the epoxide, leading to specific coupling patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl protons are adjacent to the aromatic ring, leading to coupling with the aromatic protons.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the options and their structures.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So that would be an epoxide where the styryl group is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-O

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O forming an epoxide ring. So the epoxide would be between the two CH2 groups, making a three-membered ring.

So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH3 ?

No, that's an ether, not an epoxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-CH3

But that would be an epoxide only if the O is between the two CH2 groups. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
Ph-CH2  CH3

Hmm, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Another approach: Let's count the number of protons in each NMR.

In the 1H NMR, the integration is:

3H (s) + 3H (s) = 6H,

1H (d),

2H (d),

1H (d),

2H (d).

Total: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12H.

The molecular formula is C11H12O. The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0.

So (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees of unsaturation, which can be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an epoxide (which is a ring, 1), and another double bond (1?), but I'm not sure.

But in the product, the 1H NMR shows 12H, which matches the formula (since H=12 in the product, but the formula is C11H12O). So that's correct.

Looking back at the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product must have a carbonyl group. But the options are epoxides, which don't have carbonyls. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the product is not an epoxide, but the question says the options are epoxides. So maybe the 197.7 is not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I misread the 13C NMR. Let me check:

The 13C NMR: 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So nine carbons in total, which matches the formula C11H12O: 11 carbons.

Wait, but 197.7 ppm is a very high shift, which is typical for a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. But all the options are epoxides without a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not an epoxidation but a ring-opening of an epoxide, leading to a carbonyl. But then, the product wouldn't be an epoxide anymore.

Hmm, perhaps the initial analysis is flawed. Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is not a carbonyl. Let me think: what else can cause a 13C shift around 200 ppm?

Wait, maybe it's an ester carbonyl? Or an amide? No, the reaction doesn't involve amides.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a vinyl carbonyl, like in an enone system. So if the structure has a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond, like in a cyclopropane ring.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So, the structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) where one of the carbons is attached to a prop-1-en-2-yl group that's substituted with a phenyl.

So the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
Ph-CH2- CH(CH3)

Wait, no, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So that would be:

Ph-C(=CH2)-CH2-O

Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-Ph, but that's not right. Alternatively, it's CH2-Ph-CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-O, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-CH2-O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-CH2-O, but that would be a propenyl group attached to the epoxide.

I think I'm getting stuck in the structures. Maybe I should count the signals.

The 1H NMR has two singlets (6H total) in the methyl regions. So perhaps they are two separate methyl groups, each attached to something that doesn't split their signals.

Looking at option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

The structure would have an oxirane ring (epoxide) with one carbon attached to a propenyl group which is substituted with a phenyl.

The propenyl group would be CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond. So the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-O connected to the epoxide.

Wait, but that would give a structure where the epoxide ring is connected to CH2-CH2-Ph. But then, I'm not seeing where the methyl groups would come from in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH(CH3)-CH2-Ph, but that's not matching the description.

Wait, another approach: the product's 1H NMR shows two methyl groups as singlets. So perhaps the structure has two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl or to an epoxide.

If the product is an epoxide with two methyl groups attached to the two oxygen-bearing carbons, that would explain the two singlets.

So, structure is O-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-O. But that's a four-membered ring, which isn't possible. So perhaps the two methyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons in the molecule, not part of the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure, where each of the two carbons in the epoxide has a methyl group attached.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options and the NMR data.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone. The options don't have a ketone, which suggests that perhaps the product isn't an epoxide, but the options are all epoxides. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps compound X is a carbonyl group that reacts with the reagent to form an epoxide. So X is a ketone, and the product is an epoxide. So the starting material X would be a ketone, and the product is an epoxide with one less oxygen? No, because the product's formula is C11H12O, same as X.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a different structure, but the options are all epoxides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is not a carbonyl. Maybe it's an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an epoxide carbon. But that doesn't fit with the shift.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options and pick the one that fits the NMR.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure would be an epoxide attached to a styryl group. The styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O. But that doesn't include a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR includes a carbonyl. So perhaps option D isn't the right one.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

So the structure would have a methyl group on one epoxide carbon and a styryl group on the other. So the structure is O connected to C(CH3) and C(Ph-CH=CH2).

So the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-C(Ph-CH=CH2)

In this case, the styryl group would be Ph-CH=CH- attached to the epoxide.

So, the vinyl group would cause coupling between the aromatic protons and the vinyl protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups would each be attached to the epoxide carbons, hence their signals would be singlets if they're not near any other protons.

In this structure, the aromatic protons would be split based on their positions relative to the substituent.

The styryl group would cause the aromatic ring to have substituents that split the protons into a specific pattern.

The vinyl protons would be adjacent to the aromatic ring and would couple with the aromatic protons, leading to doublets.

So, for the aromatic ring, if the substituent is a vinyl group, the protons would be split into a specific pattern.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region would have signals around 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71. These could correspond to the ortho, meta, and para protons relative to the substituent.

The 13C NMR would have the carbons for the benzene ring, the vinyl group, and the epoxide.

The two methyl groups would be attached to the epoxide carbons, giving the 21.3 and 28.4 signals.

The styryl group would contribute the carbons at 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, 130.3, 141.5, and 144.1. These are typical for aromatic carbons, including the carbons in the vinyl group.

The 197.7 would still be a problem, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 isn't a carbonyl. Maybe it's an error in the data, or perhaps it's a carbonyl in a neighboring group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is an sp3 hybridized carbon, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's an acetylenic carbon, but I don't see any indication of that in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl from a ketone in the starting material, but the product is the epoxide. So maybe the product doesn't have a carbonyl, and the 197.7 is an error, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is part of a conjugated system that shifts the carbon shift.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the integration. The 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each, so two methyl groups.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: O connected to a carbon with a 4-methylstyryl group. So, the structure would have a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached to the epoxide.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a vinyl group connected to the epoxide. The 4-methyl would mean a methyl group on the benzene ring in the para position.

In this case, the 1H NMR would show the methyl group on the benzene (as a singlet?), but in the product's NMR, the methyl groups are singlets at around 2.3 ppm, which are probably not on the benzene.

So perhaps option A is not correct.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

The substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl on the first carbon. So structure would be something like:

O
||
C-O-C
   /   \
Ph   CH2-CH2

But it's prop-1-en-2-yl, so it's CH2=C-Ph attached to the epoxide.

Wait, no, 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it's Ph-C=CH2 attached to the epoxide.

In this case, the substituent would have a vinyl group with a phenyl at one end. The 1H NMR would show signals from the vinyl protons. But would that account for the two methyl singlets?

Not sure.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

So the structure has a methyl group on one epoxide carbon and a styryl group on the other. So the substituent on the epoxide is a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-), and a methyl group on the adjacent carbon.

In this structure, the styryl group would have a vinyl proton which would couple with the aromatic protons, leading to specific splitting patterns.

The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets for the para positions and two more for the ortho positions, but with specific coupling constants.

In the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups would each be attached to the epoxide carbons, leading to their singlet signals.

The 13C NMR would show the two methyl carbons, the aromatic carbons, the vinyl carbons, and the epoxide carbons.

The 197.7 would still be a problem, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl from the starting material. But no, the product's NMR is given.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is an error, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a carbonyl group and an epoxide group, making it a different structure.

Wait, but all the options are epoxides, so perhaps the 197.7 is not part of the epoxide structure but something else.

Wait, maybe the structure is a bicyclic compound with both an epoxide and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl from a ring structure. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess.

The presence of two methyl singlets (2.28 and 2.31) suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, likely adjacent to an oxygen atom.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. The higher value (28.4) might be a CH3 attached to an oxygen, like in an epoxide.

So, the structure likely has two methyl groups attached to the epoxide ring.

Looking at the options, option C has a methyl group on the epoxide. So perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Alternatively, option D, which is 2-styrylepoxide, would have a styryl group attached to the epoxide, but where would the two methyl groups come from? There are no methyl groups in the structure of option D, so the two singlets in the 1H NMR wouldn't fit.

Wait, no, option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which would have a structure where the epoxide is connected to a styryl group. So the structure would have a benzene ring, a vinyl group, and an epoxide. But where are the methyl groups? The 1H NMR has two methyl groups, so unless the styryl group has a methyl, which it doesn't, that doesn't fit.

So, option C would have a methyl group on the epoxide and a styryl group on another carbon. So the methyl groups would be on the epoxide carbons, leading to their singlets.

In that case, the two methyl groups would be on the epoxide carbons, and the styryl group would contribute to the aromatic signals.

So, the 1H NMR would have the two methyl singlets and the aromatic protons from the styryl group.

The 13C NMR would have the two methyl carbons, the aromatic carbons, and the carbons in the styryl group.

But the 197.7 is still a problem. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is from the carbonyl in the starting material, but that doesn't make sense because the product should be an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl in a neighboring group, but I don't see how.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that option D doesn't have methyl groups. But the product's NMR has two methyl singlets.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again: the product's NMR has two methyl groups, which would require the structure to have two methyl groups.

Looking at the options, only options A and C have methyl groups.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group. That would have a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached to the epoxide.

In this case, the methyl group on the benzene would be a singlet in the 1H NMR, but it's at 2.3 ppm, which is more like a CH3 attached to something else, like oxygen.

Wait, the benzene's methyl group is usually around 2.3 ppm if it's attached to a vinyl group, but in this case, the 1H NMR shows two methyl groups at 2.28 and 2.31, which are singlets. So perhaps these are not on the benzene but elsewhere.

So option A has a methyl on the benzene, but the NMR shows two methyl groups, so perhaps that's not it.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the substituents on the epoxide are a methyl group and a styryl group. So the structure would have a methyl (CH3) on one carbon and a styryl (Ph-CH=CH-) on the other.

In this case, the two methyl groups in the NMR would be from the CH3 on the epoxide and perhaps another methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, but the formula is C11H12O. Let me count the carbons in option C.

Epoxide (2 carbons) + methyl (1C) + styryl group (Ph-CH=CH- is 6C + 2C = 8C). Wait, no, styryl is benzene (6C) plus CH=CH- (2C), so total 8C for styryl. Plus the two epoxide carbons, and the methyl is on one epoxide carbon. So total carbons would be 8 + 2 + 1 (methyl) = 11. So yes, that fits.

But in option C, the structure has only one methyl group on the epoxide. So the 1H NMR would have only one methyl singlet. But the product's NMR has two methyl singlets. So option C doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the product's formula is C11H12O. The starting material is also C11H12O. The reaction is with a base, which may abstract a proton, but the formula remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. If X is an epoxide, and the reagent opens it in a basic condition, the product would be a diol. But the product's NMR doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is used in a different reaction, like a conjugate addition.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the data.

The two methyl groups in the product suggest two CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. The only option that includes two methyl groups is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Let me count the carbons.

Epoxide (2C) + substituent: 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl.

The substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2- attached to the epoxide. So the substituent is Ph-CH2-C(=CH2)-.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-C(=O)-, but no, it's prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2=C-CH2-.

So the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond?

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, but that would only account for one methyl group.

Wait, no, option C has one methyl group on the epoxide. So the two methyl groups in the NMR don't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a ketone, but all the options are epoxides. So I must have made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is an error, and the correct structure is option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

In that case, the NMR would have the two CH2 groups attached to the oxygen as singlets, but in this structure, the epoxide would have two CH2 groups. But the 1H NMR has two CH3 groups, which doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck, but I think the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The reaction conditions suggest a possible epoxidation or rearrangement, and the product's NMR data must be analyzed to determine the structure of Compound X.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - Two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H), indicating two methyl groups attached to something that does not split their signals, likely near an electronegative atom.
   - Aromatic region shows four signals: δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), and δ 7.71 (2H, d), suggesting a substituted aromatic ring with specific coupling patterns.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - Two methyl carbons at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4.
   - Aromatic carbons at δ 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3.
   - A carbonyl carbon at δ 197.7, which is unusual for an epoxide but could indicate a conjugated system or another functional group.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**
- This structure includes a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group connected to the epoxide.
- The methyl group on the benzene would typically appear as a singlet, but its chemical shift (around 2.3 ppm) is inconsistent with a benzyl methyl group. Additionally, this structure does not account for the two methyl singlets observed in the 1H NMR.

#### **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**
- This structure features an epoxide with a propenyl group substituted with a phenyl group.
- The structure does not include two methyl groups, making it inconsistent with the two singlets observed in the 1H NMR. This option is unlikely.

#### **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**
- This structure has a methyl group on one epoxide carbon and a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-) on the other.
- The methyl group on the epoxide would explain one of the singlets in the 1H NMR. However, this structure only accounts for one methyl group, not the two observed in the NMR data. Thus, this option is also unlikely.

#### **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**
- This structure consists of an epoxide with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-) attached to one of the epoxide carbons.
- The styryl group explains the aromatic signals in the 1H NMR. However, this structure does not include two methyl groups, which are clearly observed in the NMR data. Despite this inconsistency, the other options are less plausible.

### Conclusion:
The presence of two methyl singlets in the 1H NMR suggests that the product includes two methyl groups, which none of the options fully account for. However, based on the aromatic splitting patterns and the overall structure, **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide** is the most consistent with the NMR data, despite the unresolved issue of the two methyl groups.

Answer: D
