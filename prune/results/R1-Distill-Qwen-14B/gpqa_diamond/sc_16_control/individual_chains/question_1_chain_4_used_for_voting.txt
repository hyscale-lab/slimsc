Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference ΔE between these two states so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, with various values in eV.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play, especially when dealing with energy and lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant divided by 2π. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details. Let me think. I think the uncertainty principle can also be expressed as ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the lifetime of the state, which is the uncertainty in time. Or maybe it's half of that? Or perhaps it's an approximation. Anyway, the key idea is that the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. A longer lifetime means a smaller energy uncertainty and vice versa.

So for each state, E1 has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, and E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 seconds. Wait, no. Wait, the energy states themselves don't have lifetimes, right? Oh wait, no, I think the question is that E1 and E2 are the energies of two different states, each with their own lifetimes. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the question says two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 and have lifetimes of 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So each state has its own lifetime.

Wait, but how does the lifetime relate to the energy difference between them? I think in spectroscopy, the lifetime of a state affects the linewidth of the spectral line. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is related to the lifetime (τ). The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but here, we have two states. The question is about distinguishing between the two energy levels. So the energy difference between them should be larger than the uncertainty in their energies so that they are resolvable. Otherwise, the lines would overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So perhaps the energy uncertainty for each state is ħ divided by its own lifetime. So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

But wait, the problem is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let's denote ΔE as |E2 - E1|. We need ΔE to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each of their uncertainties? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolving condition is that the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Otherwise, their spectral lines would overlap, making them indistinct.

So, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between them should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe just greater than the largest uncertainty. Let me think.

Wait, the uncertainty principle here is about each state individually. For each state, the energy isn't precisely known; there's a spread around each energy. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

So, if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the sum of these two uncertainties, then the two states can be clearly distinguished. Otherwise, their energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So, let's compute the individual uncertainties.

First, let's get the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.05e-25 J. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-8) ≈ 1.05e-26 J.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, perhaps. Or maybe just larger than the maximum of the two. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal condition is that ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty of each state, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, another approach: in spectroscopy, the resolving power of a spectrometer is often given by the condition that the energy difference must be greater than the linewidth (which is proportional to 1/τ). So, the resolving condition is ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2, but that's not necessarily correct because each state has its own uncertainty. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference as being much larger than the individual uncertainties. So, if the energy difference is much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

But the problem is to find which of the options is a possible ΔE so that they can be clearly resolved. So perhaps we can compute the minimal ΔE required.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, but I'm not certain. Another approach: the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so for each state, the energy is uncertain by that amount. Therefore, the two states' energy ranges must not overlap. So the separation between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let's compute that.

ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9) ≈ 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.

ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

So sum is about 1.155e-25 J.

But wait, let's convert that into eV because the options are in eV. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is 1.05e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is 1.05e-26 J /1.602e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

So sum is about 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = approximately 7.21e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait, that's an extremely small value. Let me check the calculations because the numbers seem way too small, which can't be right considering the options are 1e-4 eV and others.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation step by step.

First, compute ħ: ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert that to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 (eV) = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (1.05457e-25) / (1.602e-19) ≈ (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 ≈ approx 0.658 * 1e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.

So sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is approximately 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = about 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, that's around 7.2e-7 eV. But looking at the options, the smallest option is 1e-11 eV (option B), then 1e-9 (A), then 1e-8 (D), and 1e-4 (C). So 7e-7 eV is larger than all these options except C, which is 1e-4 eV. But wait, 7e-7 is bigger than 1e-4? No, wait 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 7e-7 is 0.0000007. So 1e-4 is larger than 7e-7. So 7e-7 eV is smaller than option C.

Wait, but this suggests that the required ΔE is about 7e-7 eV. But none of the options are that. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the sum of the uncertainties but the relative uncertainty. Or perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is such that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. So, for instance, ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2.

Wait, but let's compute the individual uncertainties in eV.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE must be larger than both of those. So any ΔE larger than the larger of the two would suffice. So if ΔE is larger than 6.58e-7 eV, then it would be larger than both.

But wait, none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8.

Wait, but 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.58e-7 eV (which is 0.000000658 eV). So 1e-4 is way larger than 6.58e-7.

So if ΔE is 1e-4 eV, which is option C, that's way larger than both uncertainties. So the energy difference of 1e-4 eV would be clearly resolvable.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV

B) 1e-11 eV

C) 1e-4 eV

D) 1e-8 eV

So, the required ΔE is about 7e-7 eV. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is about the uncertainty in the energy difference, rather than the individual uncertainties. Or perhaps it's about the energy width of each state.

Wait, another thought. Suppose you have two states with energies E1 and E2, each with their own lifetimes. When you make a measurement, the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2. So the separation between E1 and E2 must be such that E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So that the two intervals [E1 - ΔE1, E1 + ΔE1] and [E2 - ΔE2, E2 + ΔE2] do not overlap. So the separation should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

So, in that case, the minimal ΔE is sum of the uncertainties.

But earlier calculation gave sum as about 7.238e-7 eV, which is 0.7238e-6 eV, or 0.7238 µeV. None of the options are close. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in energy for each state is inversely proportional to their own lifetimes. So the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy uncertainty for each state and ensure that the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the states are resolvable.

In that case, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would work.

Looking at the options, the only option larger than 6.58e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, much larger than 6.58e-7 eV).

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, it would be well above the required 6.58e-7 eV, making the states resolvable. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's see:

Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.000000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So that's too small.

Option B is 1e-11 eV; even smaller.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is still smaller than 6.58e-7 eV (0.000000658 eV).

Only option C is larger than 6.58e-7 eV (since 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV is larger than 0.000000658 eV).

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial calculation suggested the sum of uncertainties is about 7.2e-7 eV, but option C is much larger, so it would satisfy the condition. So any ΔE larger than this sum would suffice.

Thus, the correct answer is option C, 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), and lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant. Converting the uncertainties to electronvolts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

From the calculations:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than approximately \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the given options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: Much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), satisfies the condition.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small.

The only option that ensures the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is **Option C**.
