Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says: We have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 mixed together. We need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are A to D, with some values in kcal and others in kJ. Wait, I should probably make sure I know what each unit is. Oh right, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so that could affect the answer.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Normally, it's about one mole of acid reacting with one mole of base, but here it's a bit more complex because we have different acids and a strong base.

Let me break down the reactants. First, HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, is it fully dissociated in solution? I think the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-), but the second H+ (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) might not be as complete, but in strong solutions, it's often considered to dissociate completely. Or wait, maybe for the sake of this problem, we can assume all H+ from H2SO4 is available because the concentration is high enough. Or perhaps, the problem just wants us to consider all H+ ions from both acids.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Its formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^- when dissolved. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So the base here is providing 2 equivalents of OH- per mole.

So the neutralization reaction will involve H+ ions from both HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

To find the enthalpy change, I think the key is to find the moles of H+ and OH- available, determine the limiting reagent, and then calculate the heat based on that.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4: it's 0.3 M, 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Because each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much reaction occurs.

We have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-. So OH- is the limiting reagent here; it's the smaller amount. So all 0.2 moles OH- will react with 0.2 moles H+ to form 0.2 moles H2O.

Wait, but wait a second. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but if it's a strong acid, the second H+ is also available. So the calculations are correct—0.18 moles H+ from H2SO4 and 0.1 from HCl, totaling 0.28.

But the OH- is only 0.2 moles. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will be neutralized, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

So the neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and the enthalpy change is based on that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH- to form water. The standard value is about -57.3 kJ per mole for strong acids and strong bases.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ react with OH-, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. But let me check the options. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Wait no, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh, because the units are mixed.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy in kcal or kJ. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. So the calculation I did was in kJ, but one of the options is in kcal. Let me convert.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57.3 kJ per mole (exothermic, so negative). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way higher. Option B is about -11.42 kcal. Since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, let me see.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is about how many kcal? 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So if the correct enthalpy is about -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.73 kcal. But that's not one of the options. Wait, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Let's see: HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is in excess. So all OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

Thus, moles of H2O formed: 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But none of the options have this. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the moles of H+ available isn't 0.28, but less. Or maybe I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but only the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is weak. Wait, but the problem gives H2SO4 as 0.3 M. Wait, in reality, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete, but the second is not. But I'm not sure if the problem expects that or not.

Wait, but the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed." So perhaps the neutralization is between the available H+ ions and OH-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of H+ ions. Let me think: H2SO4 is a strong acid, so in solution, it fully dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

HCl is 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

Total = 0.28 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So as before, 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

Wait, but then the neutralization is only 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-. So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So that's approximately -11.46 kJ, which is around -2.73 kcal (since 11.46 kJ ≈ 2.73 kcal). Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -47.9 kJ (because 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.77). That's way higher than our calculation of -11.46 kJ.

So why the discrepancy? Because the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. The problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization," but doesn't specify the units. But looking at the options, both A and B are in kcal, D is in kJ.

Wait, perhaps the question is using different values for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's per mole of acid or per mole of base. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy value is 57.3 kJ per mole of H+? Because that's what I used.

Wait, let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So that's correct.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ → approximately -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So I'm thinking the correct answer is A.

But wait, let me check the mixing of all the solutions. Because when you mix solutions, the total volume changes, but the moles don't. So the mixing doesn't affect the moles, just the concentrations. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the maximum possible reaction. Wait, in this case, the OH- is the limiting reactant, so the maximum reaction is 0.2 moles of H2O formed. So the heat is based on that.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ or approximately -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is extremely close. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, let me check the math again. 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ. So in kcal, that's 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal, so -2.736 kcal. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about right. So that must be the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. Wait, sometimes, the enthalpy of neutralization is given as 57 kJ/mol. Let me recalculate.

0.2 mol ×57 = 11.4 kJ → 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that would be exactly option A: -2.72 kcal.

Yes, that's the answer. So the correct option is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available.

### Step 1: Moles of H⁺ ions
- **HCl**:  
  Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since each HCl molecule provides 1 H⁺ ion, moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

- **H₂SO₄**:  
  Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each H₂SO₄ molecule provides 2 H⁺ ions, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Total H⁺**:  
  \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Moles of OH⁻ ions
- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule provides 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 3: Limiting Reagent
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \).  
- Moles of H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Moles of OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ will react.

### Step 4: Enthalpy of Neutralization
The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) for strong acids and strong bases.  
- Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  

Convert to kcal:  
\( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \), so  
\( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \).

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to \( -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \) is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
