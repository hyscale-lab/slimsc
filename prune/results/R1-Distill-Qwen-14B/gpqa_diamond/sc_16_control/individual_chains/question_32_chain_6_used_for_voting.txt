Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium normally has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because protons plus neutrons equal the mass number. So Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its gamma factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, so gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Given that v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation. Let me calculate beta first, which is v/c. So beta is 0.96. Then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Wait, let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should be precise here because the answer requires four decimal places. Let's calculate the square more accurately. 0.96 * 0.96 is exactly 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Hmm, approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the particle is given by the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, no, in particle physics, when we talk about the energy in colliders, it's often the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. But sometimes it's the kinetic energy. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". RHIC accelerates ions to high speeds, and the energy typically refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes in these contexts, it's the total energy. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the formula for total energy.

The total energy E is gamma * m0 * c². The rest mass energy is m0 c². So if I can find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus, then multiply by gamma, I'll get the total energy.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think in this case, the energy refers to the kinetic energy. Because when accelerators are said to have an energy, it's usually the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. So the total energy E_total is gamma * m0 c², and the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So I need to find either K or E_total, but let me check the options. The options are all in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So I think the question is asking for the kinetic energy because the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, and the energy would be much higher than the rest mass energy.

Wait, no wait. Let me think again. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So it's the energy that the RHIC imparts, which would be the kinetic energy. So K = (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So first, I need to find the rest mass energy of Li-6. Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Wait, how do I find that number? I think the exact value for the mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. Let me double-check. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol for natural lithium, but for Li-6, the mass is lower. Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact value. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a certain approximation.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass number A. The mass of one nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Since the nucleus is Li-6 with 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the rest mass energy would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, this is an approximation, and the actual mass might be slightly different due to binding energy and such. But perhaps for this problem, this approximation is acceptable.

Wait, but more accurately, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3*(938.272) = 2814.816 MeV
3*(939.565) = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

But wait, that's just the sum of individual nucleon masses. The actual mass of the nucleus is less due to the mass defect (binding energy). But I'm not sure if the problem accounts for that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass including electrons. Hmm, but for heavy ions, the electrons' rest mass is negligible compared to the nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 u * c² converted to GeV. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Wait, but which approach is correct? Let me think. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is indeed approximately the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy. But for rough calculations, sometimes people approximate the mass of a nucleus with A nucleons as A * 938 MeV. However, the exact value for Li-6 is known. Let me try to recall or compute it.

Actually, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0145 atomic mass units (u). So converting that into GeV/c²: 6.0145 u * 931.494 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6.0145 * 931.494 ≈ Let's calculate step by step.

First, 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0145 * 931.494 = let's compute 0.01 * 931.494 = 9.31494, and 0.0045 * 931.494 ≈ 4.1917 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 + 9.31494 = 5598.27894 +4.1917= 5602.4706 MeV. So about 5.60247 GeV.

So m0 c² is approximately 5.6025 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually 6.0145 u. Let me confirm: the exact mass is 6.0145015 u. So 6.0145015 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

6.0145015 * 931.494 = let's compute:

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0145015 * 931.494 = ?

0.01 * 931.494 = 9.31494.

0.0045015 * 931.494 ≈ 0.004 *931.494= 3.72598, plus 0.0005015*931.494 ≈ approx 0.466.

So 3.72598 + 0.466 ≈ 4.192 MeV.

So total for 0.0145015 is approx 9.31494 +4.192=13.50694 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5588.964 +13.50694= 5602.47094 MeV, which is 5.60247 GeV. So m0 c² ≈5.6025 GeV.

So, that's the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

Now gamma is 3.5714286 (since 1/0.28 is exactly 35/8 ≈ 3.57142857).

So the total energy E_total = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714286 * 5.6025 GeV.

Calculating that:

3.5714286 * 5.6025 ≈ Let's compute.

First, 3 *5.6025=16.8075.

0.5714286 *5.6025: Let's compute 0.5 *5.6025=2.80125; 0.0714286≈1/14. So 5.6025 /14 ≈0.400179.

So 0.5 contributes 2.80125, 0.0714286 contributes 0.400179.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach: 3.5714286 is 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714286.

Wait, 3.5714286 is exactly 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714286. Alternatively, perhaps compute 3.5714286 *5.6025.

3.5714286 ≈ 25/7 (since 25/7 ≈3.57142857). So 25/7 *5.6025.

5.6025 = 56025/10000 = 2241/400.

So 25/7 * 2241/400 = (25 *2241) / (7 *400 )= (56025) / (2800 )= approx 20.0089286 GeV.

Wait, wait, 56025 divided by 2800.

Let me compute 2800 *20=56,000. So 56025 is 25 more than 56,000. So 56025/2800 = 20 + 25/2800 = 20 + 5/(560) ≈ 20 + 0.00892857 = 20.0089286 GeV.

So E_total is approximately 20.0089 GeV.

But wait, that's the total energy. The kinetic energy is E_total minus m0 c².

So K = E_total - m0 c² = 20.0089 GeV -5.6025 GeV =14.4064 GeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are around 20 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I was supposed to calculate the total energy and not the kinetic energy. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, my calculation for E_total gives about 20.0089 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute gamma again. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)), where beta is 0.96.

Compute 1 - beta^2 = 1- (0.96)^2 = 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, so gamma is exactly 35/8 =4.375? No, wait 35/8 is 4.375. Oh wait no, 35/8 is 4.375. But 0.28 is 28/100 =7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

So gamma is 25/7=3.57142857.

m0 c² is 5.60247 GeV.

So E_total = (25/7) *5.60247.

Compute 5.60247 *25 = 140.06175.

Then divide by7: 140.06175 /7=20.0088214 GeV.

So approximately 20.0088 GeV.

So the total energy is approximately 20.0088 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake with the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6. Let me double-check. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.0145015 u. So 6.0145015 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6.0145015 *931.494.

Let me compute this more accurately. 

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0145015 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0045015 *931.494 = let's compute 0.004 *931.494=3.725976, and 0.0005015 *931.494≈0.466225.

So 3.725976 + 0.466225=4.192201.

So total for 0.0145015 is 9.31494 +4.192201=13.507141 MeV.

So the rest mass is 5588.964 + 13.507141 =5602.471141 MeV, which is 5.602471141 GeV.

So E_total= (25/7)*5.602471141 GeV.

25/7 is approximately 3.571428571.

So 3.571428571 *5.602471141 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.602471141 *3 =16.807413423.

5.602471141 *0.5 =2.8012355705.

5.602471141 *0.071428571 (which is 1/14) = ?

0.071428571 is 1/14, so 5.602471141 /14 = approximately 0.40017651 GeV.

So adding them together:

16.807413423 (from 3x) +2.8012355705 (0.5x) =19.608649.

Then +0.40017651 (0.07142857x) gives 20.0088255 GeV.

So E_total is approximately 20.0088 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass energy calculation. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the kinetic energy.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." RHIC's energy is typically given as the kinetic energy of the ions. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m0 c^2.

Gamma is 25/7, so gamma-1 is 18/7 ≈2.57142857.

So K = (18/7) *5.602471141 GeV.

Compute 5.602471141 *18 =100.8444799 GeV.

Then divide by 7: 100.8444799 /7 ≈14.40635428 GeV.

So K is approximately 14.406 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14 GeV. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because the options are around 20 GeV.

Wait the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

My calculation for E_total was about 20.0088 GeV. So closest to option C (20.132 GeV). So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

Beta is 0.96, so beta^2 =0.9216. So 1 - beta^2=0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass energy. Let me check the exact value. The mass of Li-6 is 6.0145015 u. 1 u is 931.494061 MeV/c².

So 6.0145015 u *931.494061 MeV/u=?

6 *931.494061 =5588.964366 MeV.

0.0145015 u *931.494061 MeV/u=?

0.0145015 *931.494061.

Calculating 0.01 *931.494061=9.31494061.

0.0045015 *931.494061.

Compute 0.004 *931.494061=3.725976244.

0.0005015 *931.494061= approx 0.466226.

So sum is 3.725976244 +0.466226≈4.192202.

So 0.0145015 u contributes 9.31494061 +4.192202 ≈13.5071426 MeV.

Adding to 5588.964366 MeV gives 5602.471508 MeV, which is 5.602471508 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.6024715 GeV.

Then E_total = gamma * m0 c² = (25/7) *5.6024715.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6024715.

Hmm, let me compute this exactly.

3.57142857 multiplied by 5 is 17.85714285.

3.57142857 multiplied by 0.6024715:

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 * 0.0024715 ≈.

0.0024715 *3.57142857.

0.002 *3.57142857=0.00714285714.

0.0004715 *3.57142857≈0.0016807142.

So total approx 0.00714285714 + 0.0016807142=0.0088235713.

So 3.57142857 *0.0024715 ≈0.0088235713.

So total for 3.57142857 *0.6024715 is approx 2.142857142 +0.0088235713≈2.151680713.

So total E_total=17.85714285 +2.151680713=20.00882356 GeV.

So approximately 20.0088 GeV.

So the total energy is about 20.0088 GeV. The closest option is option C, 20.132 GeV, but there's a discrepancy of about 0.123 GeV, which is 123 MeV. That's a bit significant. Why is there a difference?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0145015 u. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the actual mass is slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron, ignoring binding energy. Let me compute with the sum of protons and neutrons without binding energy.

Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron 939.565 MeV/c².

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m0 =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV/c² =5.633511 GeV.

So using this, E_total would be gamma * m0 c² = (25/7)*5.633511 GeV.

Compute 5.633511 *25=140.837775.

Divide by7: 140.837775/7=20.119682 GeV.

Approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

Ah, so I think I see where I went wrong earlier. I used the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which includes the binding energy, but perhaps the problem expects us to simply sum the masses of the nucleons (protons and neutrons) without considering the binding energy. Because in particle physics, sometimes the rest mass is approximated as the sum of the masses of the constituent nucleons.

So using 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each with their respective masses, gives m0 c² of approximately 5.6335 GeV. So E_total = (25/7)*5.6335.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6335 = let's compute.

3 *5.6335=16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335.

0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.07142857 *5.6335 ≈ 0.4043.

So sum is 2.81675 +0.4043=3.22105.

So total E_total=16.9005 +3.22105=20.12155 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1216 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but earlier when I used the exact nuclear mass including binding energy, I got E_total around 20.0088 GeV, which is about 20 GeV, but none of the options match that except option C is 20.132. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Wait, let's think about that.

The mass of the Li-6 atom is 6.0145015 u. But that includes the mass of the electrons as well. Because the atomic mass includes the electrons, which is 3 electrons for Li. But in the nucleus, the electrons are not part of the nucleus. Hmm, but in the context of RHIC, which deals with heavy ions, the ions are typically bare nuclei, meaning they have lost their electrons (ions). So the mass considered would be the nuclear mass, not including electrons.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.0145015 u. No, wait, no. Wait, the atomic mass (like in periodic table) is the mass of the atom, including electrons. So the nucleus' mass is slightly less.

The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.0145015 u minus the mass of electrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0145015 u. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. Li has 3 electrons, so the mass of the nucleus is 6.0145015 u - 3*(0.00054858 u).

Compute 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.0145015 -0.00164574=6.01285576 u.

6.01285576 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6 u *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01285576 u *931.494 MeV/u = let's compute.

0.01 u *931.494=9.31494 MeV.

0.00285576 u *931.494: 0.002 *931.494=1.862988 MeV.

0.00085576 *931.494 ≈ approx 0.7985 MeV.

So total for 0.00285576 u is 1.862988 +0.7985=2.661488 MeV.

So 0.01285576 u contributes 9.31494 +2.661488=11.976428 MeV.

So total nucleus mass is 5588.964 MeV +11.976428 MeV=5600.940428 MeV →5.600940428 GeV.

So m0 c² is approximately 5.60094 GeV.

Then E_total = (25/7) *5.60094 GeV.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.60094.

3 *5.60094=16.80282.

0.57142857 *5.60094.

0.5 *5.60094=2.80047.

0.07142857 *5.60094 ≈0.4000 (approx 0.4000).

So 2.80047 +0.4000=3.20047.

Total E_total=16.80282 +3.20047=20.00329 GeV.

So approximately 20.0033 GeV.

Which is close to 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, but with this approach, it's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

Proton: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron:939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E_total= (25/7)*5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *25 =140.837775.

140.837775 /7=20.119682 GeV≈20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, so perhaps the exact calculation would give a value closer to 20.132 GeV. Let me compute more accurately.

5.633511 GeV *25/7.

25/7 is exactly 3.57142857142857.

5.633511 *3.57142857142857.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857142857=17.85714285714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714285714.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.1193.

So 0.633511 *3.57142857≈2.14285714285714 +0.1193≈2.262157.

So total E_total=17.85714285714285 +2.262157≈20.1193 GeV.

So approximately 20.1193 GeV.

Which is about 20.1193 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps there are more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Given v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857142857.

But perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784, exactly. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=35/8=4.375? Wait, no, 0.28 is 28/100=7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the rest mass is computed using the exact mass, including binding energy, which brings it down.

Earlier, when I used the exact nuclear mass (6.0145015 u), I got E_total≈20.0088 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than that. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses (without binding energy), which gives around 20.1197 GeV.

So the correct option would be C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but when I sum the masses, I get 5.6335 GeV. Multiply by 35/7=5.6335 *3.57142857=20.1197 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation gives 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers relativistic effects more precisely or uses more precise values for the masses.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the exact gamma and then multiply.

Compute gamma = 25/7 = 3.57142857142857.

m0 c² =5.633511 GeV.

So E_total= 3.57142857142857 *5.633511.

Let me do this multiplication precisely.

5.633511 *3.57142857142857.

Let me compute 5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857142857.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07=0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857142857≈0.00805042.

So 5.633511 *0.07142857142857≈0.39434577 +0.00805042=0.40239619.

So total E_total=16.900533 +2.8167555 +0.40239619.

16.900533 +2.8167555=19.7172885.

19.7172885 +0.40239619=20.1196847 GeV.

So about 20.119685 GeV, which is ~20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher but very close. So I think the correct answer is C)20.132 GeV.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using relativistic mechanics. The total energy \( E_{\text{total}} \) is given by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

The rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \) of the Li-6 nucleus is approximated by summing the masses of its nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). Using the proton mass \( m_p = 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and neutron mass \( m_n = 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), we calculate:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \) into the total energy formula:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.633511 = 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or more precise intermediate values. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
