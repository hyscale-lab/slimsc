Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait—no, benzene is a ring, so the numbering would be 1, 2, 3 in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. But the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize that. Position 1: ethoxy. Position 2: tert-butyl. Position 3: nitro group.

Wait, but when numbering, you take the substituents in alphabetical order. Ethoxy starts with E, nitro with N, tert-butyl with T. Wait, no, the substituents are ordered by their prefixes: ethoxy (E), nitro (N), tert-butyl (T). Oh wait, no, I think the substituents are ordered by their first letter in the name. So, E comes before N and T. So the substituents are ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl.

Wait, in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order except for the position. So the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the numbering should be such that the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2.

Alternatively, maybe the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, considering their priority. Nitro groups have higher priority than ethoxy, which in turn is higher than t-butyl? Wait, substituent priority is based on the first atom. Nitro has N, ethoxy has O, tert-butyl has C. So nitro (N) > ethoxy (O) > t-butyl (C). Wait, no, the priority goes based on the first atom's atomic number. Nitrogen (7) is higher than oxygen (8)? Wait no, oxygen is higher than nitrogen. So O has higher priority than N? Wait, no: atomic numbers go O=8, N=7. So O comes after N. So in terms of priority, the order is: O (ethoxy) > N (nitro) > C (t-butyl). So substituents are ordered by O, N, C.

Wait, but when numbering, the substituents are given the lowest possible numbers, regardless of their priority. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. But if the substituents are ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3, and t-butyl at 2, then the numbering starts with the ethoxy as position 1. Alternatively, maybe another numbering could give lower numbers.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the substituents are ortho, meta, para relative to each other. Let me sketch it out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the synthesis steps. The question is, which sequence of reactions starting from benzene will yield the target compound.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, nitro, and t-butyl groups. So we need to introduce each substituent via electrophilic substitution or other reactions.

But since the substituents can direct incoming groups, the order of their introduction matters.

Benzene is initially activated towards electrophilic substitution. Adding a directing group will influence where the next substituent goes.

Let's think about the substituents:

- t-butyl group: bulky, and it's a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group, an electron-donating substituent). It's ortho/para directing.

- Ethoxy group: similar to OMe, it's an activating group (electron-donating through lone pairs), but it's ortho/para directing. However, since it's an ether, it's less activating than t-butyl.

- Nitro group: deactivating, meta directing.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So when we add nitro, it will not allow further substitution in certain positions.

So the strategy is to add the groups in an order that allows for the correct positions.

Let me outline the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, let me assign the positions:

Let's number the benzene ring so that the ethoxy is at position 1, the t-butyl at position 2, and the nitro at position 3.

So, the substituents are all adjacent to each other. Wait, no. Benzene is a ring, so position 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in order. So the three substituents are at adjacent positions.

Wait, that's a meta arrangement? No, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, which would form a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Hmm, that's an unusual structure. Alternatively, perhaps I need to think that the substituents are in such a way that two are in ortho positions and one is meta. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me try to think about the synthesis steps.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the nitro group is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-butyl at 2. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

But in benzene, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So the substituents are all next to each other. That's a 1,2,3-tri substitution.

Wait, but adding three substituents to benzene in this way requires that each substituent is introduced in a way that directs the next group to the desired position.

Let me think about the steps. Starting from benzene.

First, perhaps I should introduce the nitro group. But wait, nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. If I add it first, the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to nitro. But that might complicate the addition of the other groups.

Alternatively, adding the ethoxy group first. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para directing. Then, adding the t-butyl group in a position influenced by the ethoxy group. Then, adding the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the t-butyl first, since it's a strong activating group, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the order of the substituents. Nitro is a deactivating group, so it's better to add it last because it makes the ring less reactive towards further substitution. The ethoxy and t-butyl are activating, so we should add them earlier.

So the plan is: first, introduce the ethoxy group. Then, introduce the t-butyl group. Finally, introduce the nitro group.

Wait, but when adding multiple substituents, the order and directing effects are crucial. Let's see.

Step 1: Benzene → introduce ethoxy group.

How? Using an electrophilic substitution. For example, via Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible for ethoxy, because alkylation requires an alkyl halide, but benzene would undergo electrophilic substitution. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation. But for introducing an ether group, perhaps we can use a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the ethoxy group via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually under strong conditions and requires a strongly activated ring. Alternatively, maybe introducing the ethoxy via a substitution reaction, but that's tricky.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after some activating groups are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring is nitrated and then reduced. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ethoxylation via a substitution, but perhaps that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification using something like a Williamson-type approach, but that's generally for alcohols and alkyl halides, not directly applicable to benzene.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts requires an alkyl halide that's a primary or secondary, but the problem is that the alkyl group from Friedel-Crafts tends to undergo rearrangement. Moreover, benzene is deactivating towards alkylation because the ethoxy group is an activating group, but wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group to direct the incoming electrophile. Wait, no, benzene itself is activated enough for Friedel-Crafts. Wait, wait, benzene is not strongly activated, but for Friedel-Crafts, the ring must be activated. So benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but it's more selective towards acylation since alkylation tends to produce carbocations that can rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a different method. Let me think. Oh, wait, perhaps via the use of an electrophilic reagent. For example, using ethyl nitrite with H2SO4, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via the replacement of a hydrogen with an ethoxy group, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible options given in the question. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions.

Wait, let me look at the options. Each option lists steps i to ix. Let's see what each step does.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: that's Friedel-Crafts alkylation, introducing the t-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation, which is a strong activating group (but wait, sulfonic acid groups are meta directors but deactivating because they're strong -SO3H groups.)

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization, but that's for aryl amines, but benzene isn't amine.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me step back.

Each option's steps:

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride with AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-butyl group to benzene.

ii) HNO3, H2SO4: nitration.

iii) SO3, H2SO4: sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2, HCl: diazotization, but benzene doesn't have an amine. This step might not make sense unless a ring has an amine group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are applied to intermediates with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps each step is an addition of a substituent in the order of the steps.

So, option A's steps are:

1. t-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Nitration.

3. Sulfonation.

4. Diazotization.

Hmm, that seems a bit off, because after nitration, you have a nitro group which is deactivating, making further substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonation is done before nitration, but in option A, it's after nitration.

Wait, given that, let's think about the order.

If the starting material is benzene, step i is FC alkylation to add t-butyl group. Now, the ring has a t-butyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para director.

Step ii: nitration. So the nitration would occur at the ortho or para positions relative to the t-butyl group. Let's say para, but depending on steric factors, ortho may be less favored. So nitro would be at para position. But then, when we add the ethoxy group, where would it go?

Wait, but the target requires the ethoxy at position 1, nitro at 3, t-butyl at 2. So the substitution pattern is 1,2,3.

Hmm. Maybe the order is wrong.

Alternatively, let's think of another approach. Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, then the t-butyl, then the nitro.

But how to introduce the ethoxy group first.

Wait, perhaps introducing the ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution. But benzene is not nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps via a directing group that can be replaced.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a nitration followed by reduction, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group like a methyl group, but that's probably not needed here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group, but wait, nitro is deactivating, making substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's tricky because ethoxylation would require an ethyl group as an electrophile. Wait, Friedel-Crafts is for adding alkyl or acyl groups. So to add ethoxy, perhaps we need to use ethyl chloride and AlCl3. So, benzene would undergo FC alkylation with ethyl chloride. But wait, ethyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide, which can undergo FC alkylation, but it's more prone to carbocation rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a more stable carbocation, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether substitution. Wait, maybe via a benzene ring with a leaving group, but that's more applicable to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires strong activating groups.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the steps in each option and see which order makes sense.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration of benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: this is for reduction, perhaps to reduce nitro group to amine.

But why would nitration be first step? Let me think.

Wait, benzene first nitrated, then perhaps something else. Let's see the steps in option D:

i) Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine (aminobenzene).

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: FC alkylation. But wait, aminobenzene is strongly activating, but FC alkylation is for adding alkyl groups. But aminobenzene is so activated that FC alkylation would be difficult, as the amine is a strong activating group and directs incoming electrophiles to para positions. But wait, amine is a meta director for electrophilic substitution.

Wait, no, amine groups are strong activating, ortho/para directors. Wait, but after reduction, the ring has an amine group.

So, after step ii, we have aniline.

Step iii: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3. So, FC alkylation of aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group (ortho/para), so the t-butyl would go into ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

Wait, but aniline is so activating that FC alkylation is not feasible because the carbocation would be too unstable. Wait, no, FC alkylation requires a Lewis acid catalyst, and aniline can undergo it, but the problem is that the amine might form a complex with AlCl3, making the reaction difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the t-butyl is introduced via another method, but in this option, it's using AlCl3, so perhaps FC alkylation.

But in any case, after adding t-butyl, the next steps are more nitrations and other things.

Looking back at the target molecule, it's better to have the nitro group added last because it's deactivating. So perhaps the nitro group is added after the other substituents.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is already present. So if the nitro group is added early, it may deactivate the ring, making it difficult to add other groups.

Hmm.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D:

i) Nitration: adds nitro group to benzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine (step ii: Fe/HCl).

iii) FC alkylation with t-butyl.

iv) Nitration again: would add another nitro group, but target has only one.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the nitration in step iv is in a different position.

But the target only has one nitro group. So perhaps option D's steps would lead to multiple nitro groups, which is not desired.

So maybe D is not the correct option.

Let me check option B.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3: FC alkylation adds t-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration again.

Hmm, that seems like adding two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So maybe option B's steps would add another nitro group, which is incorrect.

Option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3: FC alkylation → benzene → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration?

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: first ethoxy, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy via FC alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is an acylation product, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that would require the ring to be highly activated. For example, if the ring has a strong activating group, like a hydroxyl group, which can be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but how to get the hydroxyl group in the first place. Maybe via a sulfonation and then displacement.

Wait, let's think: if you sulfonate benzene (SO3/H2SO4) to form benzene sulfonic acid. Then, perhaps replace the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy. But that's a nucleophilic substitution, which requires the leaving group to be a good one. Sulfonic acid groups are strong, but I'm not sure if they can be easily replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, you can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: think about the steps in option C.

Option C steps:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate. Now, the ring has t-butyl and a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate. Now, nitro group is added.

iv) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration? Hmm.

vii) H3O+/H2O/heat: hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4: perhaps acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: saponification? Or maybe an SN2 reaction.

Wait, perhaps after all this, you end up with the ethoxy group.

But I'm not getting it. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification after some steps. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present. But to have a leaving group on benzene, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic attack on a benzene ring that already has a nitro group. But nitro is deactivating, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution but more towards nucleophilic substitution. Wait, no, nitro is meta-directing and deactivating, so nucleophilic substitution is not favored either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the t-butyl first, then the nitro, then the ethoxy. But how?

Wait, after adding t-butyl (activating, ortho/para), nitration would add nitro at ortho or para to t-butyl. Then, perhaps adding ethoxy to the remaining position.

But let me think about the target structure: 2-(t-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So the t-butyl is at position 2, nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group at position 1.

2. Introduce t-butyl group at position 2.

3. Introduce nitro group at position 3.

But how to do that.

Wait, if we first introduce ethoxy, which is an activating group, then t-butyl can be added in the ortho or para positions. Then, the nitro group would be added in the meta position relative to ethoxy or t-butyl.

Wait, but let me think about the steps.

First, benzene → ethoxy group via FC alkylation. Wait, but FC alkylation with ethyl chloride would add ethyl, not ethoxy. Oh, wait, no, FC alkylation adds an alkyl group to the ring. So benzene would get an ethyl group, not an ethoxy.

Ah, right, so getting an ethoxy group via FC is not possible because FC alkylation adds alkyl groups, not ethers.

So to get an ethoxy group, perhaps we need a different approach. Maybe via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps if we have a nitro group on benzene, and then reduce it to an amine, then perform some kind of alkylation to introduce the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after making the ring highly activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the t-butyl and nitro groups via a substitution, but that would require the ring to have a good leaving group.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think about the steps in each option and see which makes sense.

Looking at option D, which starts with nitration. So benzene → nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl would reduce nitro to amino: aniline. Then, tert-butyl via FC alkylation. But aniline is a strong activating group, so the t-butyl would go para to the amino group. Then, step iv is nitration again. Would that add a nitro group? But the target has only one nitro group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps the nitro is at position 3, t-butyl at 2, ethoxy at 1.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how to get ethoxy in? Because in FC alkylation, you can't get ethoxy.

Wait, maybe after adding the t-butyl group, you can perform a nitration to add nitro group, then introduce the ethoxy via some substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about whether the ethoxy group can be introduced via an acetylation and then hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps if you acetylate the ring with an acetyl group, then introduce substituents, and then perform a nucleophilic substitution to replace the acetyl with ethoxy. But I'm not sure about that.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try another approach. Let me think about the steps in each option and see which one logically leads to the target.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl via FC alkylation → t-butyl group added at ortho or para to amino group.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group? But target has only one nitro. So this might not be the right approach.

Option B:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration again. Hmm, again, multiple nitro groups.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) Sulfonation → now, two groups: t-butyl and sulfonic acid.

iii) Nitration → nitro group.

iv) Reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotization with NaNO2.

vi) HNO3 again? Not sure.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Sulfonation.

iv) Diazotization (but without an amine, this doesn't make sense).

Wait, option A has steps that include diazotization, which requires an amine. But after nitration, the ring has a nitro group, and then sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, where is the amine?

So, perhaps none of these options are correct except one.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible steps needed:

The target has an ethoxy group, t-butyl, and nitro. So we need three substituents.

The order of addition must be such that each substituent directs the next to the correct position.

Since nitro is deactivating, it's better to add it last.

So, first, add ethoxy → which is ortho/para directing, activating.

Then, add t-butyl → ortho/para to ethoxy.

Finally, add nitro → which can go into the meta position relative to ethoxy and para to t-butyl.

Wait, but benzene can't have three substituents in such a way that all are adjacent. Or can it? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-butyl group in the para position of ethoxy.

3. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be the ortho position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me try to think of the order of reactions.

- Benzene → introduce ethoxy (using a method that allows this). How?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. For that, the ring must have a good leaving group, like a nitro group. But nitro is a meta director. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added after the ring has a nitro group, but that's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would add an acyl group, which would then be reduced to a CH2 group. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. But nitro is a meta director, so the substitution would occur in the meta position.

This is getting too confusing. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps considering the options, the correct order is adding t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy last.

Ah! Maybe after adding t-butyl and nitro, the remaining position can be substituted with ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution.

But to have a nucleophilic substitution, the ring must have a leaving group, which would be a good leaving group, such as a nitro group. But wait, nitro groups are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps after introducing a nitrate ester or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a sulfonic acid group, which can be replaced with ethoxy. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, looking at option C:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl via FC alkylation → adds t-butyl to para position (since amine is ortho/para director).

iv) Nitration → adds nitro group.

Wait, but target has only one nitro. So this may not fit.

Alternatively, maybe after adding t-butyl, the ring has an amine (from step ii) and a t-butyl group. Then, nitration would add nitro group in a position directed by the amine and t-butyl.

But this is getting too speculative.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents in the target and see which option's steps would result in them being in the correct positions.

The target is 2-(t-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at positions 1,2,3.

Assuming the ring is numbered such that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and t-butyl at 2.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group at position 1.

2. Add t-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Add nitro group at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and para to t-butyl).

But, how to add the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has both t-butyl and nitro groups.

Wait, but that would require a leaving group in the desired position.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to look for the steps that introduce the substituents in the correct order, considering directing effects.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D: steps are

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) FC alkylation → t-butyl.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

v) SO3 → sulfonate.

vi) Dilute H2SO4.

vii) H3O+/H2O/heat.

viii) Dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps after the initial nitration, reduction, and FC alkylation, adding another nitro group would not help. So likely, option D is not correct.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) reduce nitro → amine.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, maybe the nitration in step iii is the first nitro group.

Wait, perhaps after sulfonation, nitration would occur at a certain position.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm stuck and should consider another approach: looking for the steps that involve introducing the ethoxy group via a substitution, perhaps as the last step.

In which option is the ethoxy group introduced last?

Looking at the options:

Option B: steps are t-butyl, nitrate, reduce, nitrate again, etc. No ethoxy mentioned.

Option C: steps involve sulfonate, nitrate, reduce, nitrate again. No ethoxy.

Option A: steps are t-butyl, nitrate, sulfonate, diazo, etc. No ethoxy.

Option D: steps are nitrate, reduce, t-butyl, nitrate, sulfonate, etc. No ethoxy.

Wait, this can't be right. The target has an ethoxy group. So none of the options seem to introduce ethoxy. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking at the options again.

Wait, in option B, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That's a possibility for an SN2 reaction, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group via an alkoxide.

Wait, NaOH and EtBr would provide ethoxide ions. So perhaps in this step, an ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 substitution. But the ring must have a leaving group at that position.

So, perhaps in option B:

After step iv, the ring has a nitro group. Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization (but without an amine, this wouldn't work). So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification after a leaving group is present.

Wait, perhaps in option C, step viii is dilute H2SO4, which might hydrolyze something. Step ix is NaOH/EtBr, which is for elimination or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution in step ix.

Wait, perhaps the order of steps is such that by the end, the ethoxy group is added via an SN2 reaction where a leaving group is present.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D because it introduces the nitro group first, then the t-butyl, and then the ethoxy via some substitution.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro, which is meta to t-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy, which is para to nitro.

Wait, but that would place the substituents in a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

- FC alkylation with t-butyl.

- Nitration, which adds nitro in meta to t-butyl.

- Then, introduce ethoxy via substitution where needed.

But the options don't seem to line up with this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a good leaving group.

Wait, the only option that includes a step with NaOH and EtBr is option B and option C and option D.

In option B, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. So perhaps that's where the ethoxy group is introduced.

So, the steps would be:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → make diazonium salt.

vi) HNO3 → perhaps another reaction.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → introduce ethoxy via SN2.

Wait, but if the ring has a nitro group (from step iv), perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution in step vii.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is adding the t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But in that case, the steps would have to include adding ethoxy via FC alkylation, which isn't possible for ethers.

Hmm.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct option is D because it seems to add the substituents in a way that allows for the correct positions. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are all adjacent.

To get that, perhaps the nitro group is added first in position 3. Then, the t-butyl is added in position 2 (ortho to nitro, but nitro is meta director, so that wouldn't happen. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added last. So, the ring initially has ethoxy and t-butyl groups. Then, the nitro is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl.

Wait, but ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and t-butyl is ortho/para. So, the positions would be arranged accordingly.

After adding ethoxy and t-butyl, adding nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy (which would be position 3) would be possible.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl added.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) reduce.

v) diazo.

vi) nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/heat.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps in step ix, the ethoxy is introduced via an SN2 reaction. So, after all the steps, the ring has t-butyl and nitro groups, and a leaving group where the ethoxy would go.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro (meta to t-butyl).

3. Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

But without a leaving group, this isn't possible.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is D.

Wait, no, perhaps option D's steps include adding the nitro group first, then the t-butyl, then the ethoxy.

But in that case, the steps would be:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Reduce → amine.

iii) FC alkylation → t-butyl.

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro group.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Given that, I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct option is likely option D, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The synthesis must consider the directing effects of these substituents and the order in which they are introduced.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group.
   - Step iv: Diazotization (requires an amine, not present here) makes this sequence invalid.
   - This sequence does not align with the target structure, as it introduces a sulfonic acid group and does not account for the ethoxy group.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iii: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - Step iv: Nitration introduces another nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule having only one nitro group.
   - This sequence introduces multiple nitro groups and does not explain the introduction of the ethoxy group.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group.
   - Step iii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iv: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - Step v: Diazotization creates a diazonium salt.
   - Step vi: Nitration introduces another nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.
   - This sequence does not explain how the ethoxy group is introduced.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step ii: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iv: Nitration introduces another nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule having only one nitro group.
   - This sequence introduces multiple nitro groups and does not explain the introduction of the ethoxy group.

### Conclusion:
None of the options fully align with the target structure of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** appears to be the closest match, as it introduces the tert-butyl and nitro groups in a plausible order, even though it does not account for the ethoxy group or introduces multiple nitro groups. Given the constraints, **Option D** is selected as the answer.

Answer: D
