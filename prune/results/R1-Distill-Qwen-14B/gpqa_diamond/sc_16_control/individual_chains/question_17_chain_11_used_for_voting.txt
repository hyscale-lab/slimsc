Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so that's the complex ion in solution. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, I think.

Wait, right. When you have a complex like Ca-EDTA, some of the EDTA is bound to calcium, and some is free. But the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in solution. So, I think the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (or some form, depending on pH). But since the pH is ideal, maybe we don't have to worry about the protonation state of EDTA. 

I remember that the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The general equation for the complex formation is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

So, the formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = K. 

But wait, in this problem, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, assuming that the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, and we can figure out the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- from that.

Wait, but what's the stoichiometry here? The problem says it's a 1:1 stoichiometric complex. So, each Ca^2+ binds to one EDTA^4- to form CaEDTA^2−. So, I think the initial setup is that when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- in a 1:1 ratio.

So, let's think about the situation. The solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−. Let's say that some of this complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The amount that dissociates will be 'x' M. But wait, the problem is about the concentration of Ca^2+ in the solution. So, [Ca^2+] is 'x'. Similarly, [EDTA^4-] will also be 'x'. Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get a mole of each ion.

But wait, wait. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So, if 'x' is the concentration that dissociates, then:

[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x. But if x is very small compared to 0.02, this can be approximated as 0.02. Because K is a large number (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So, the solution is mostly complex, and the free ions are very low. So, I can probably approximate [CaEDTA^2−] ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2−] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

We're setting [Ca^2+] = x and [EDTA^4−] = x, because they dissociate in a 1:1 ratio.

So,

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x^2:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-6 / 5e10? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So:

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13, so sqrt is 2 * 10^-6.5. Wait, 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 ≈6.32e-7 M. So, x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes I might make a mistake in the exponents.

So, K = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2).

So, 5e10 * x^2 = 0.02.

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Yes, that's correct. So, x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So, 2e-6.5 is 2 * (10^-6.5) ≈ 2 * (3.16e-7) )= 6.32e-7 M. So, yes, option C is correct.

So, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K \)), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\). Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
