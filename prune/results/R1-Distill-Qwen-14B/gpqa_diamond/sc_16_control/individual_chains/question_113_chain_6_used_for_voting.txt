Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the data.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably an -OH group, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak around there. Also, they usually have a carbonyl peak. Hmm, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Oh, the 1700 is a strong carbonyl absorption. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl group, but that's a bit lower. Maybe an ester or conjugated carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like in an acid.

Wait, but wait. If there are two carbonyl peaks, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe one is another group. Let me think: 1700 is a typical carbonyl (like ester, ketone, aldehyde). 1650 could be an amide or maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent. But since the options don't seem to include nitrogen, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an overtone or maybe another functional group. Or perhaps it's a C=C stretch. Oh! Because the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that suggests there's a double bond somewhere. So the 1650 could be a C=C in conjugation with something else, maybe an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl. So maybe a conjugated diene or an enone?

But the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks. Wait, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Like, perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C? But the aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600, depending on substitution. So 1650 is a bit high, more like an unsaturated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which is common in esters or ketones with conjugated double bonds. For example, an enone (conjugated ketone and double bond) would have a carbonyl peak around 1700 and a C=C around 1650. That makes sense.

So the presence of two carbonyl-related peaks in FTIR suggests a compound with both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond. Alternatively, maybe an anhydride or something else, but looking at the options, maybe it's a substituted ester or a ketone with a double bond.

Next, the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens means there are protons attached to a double bond. So the compound has a double bond. Also, the presence of an -OH group (from the broad IR peak) would mean it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak, but their protons are usually exchanged and may not appear in the NMR as a peak, or they appear as a very broad peak which can sometimes be difficult to see. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol.

Wait, but in the FTIR, the broad peak is very broad at 3000, which is more suggestive of an -OH group. So maybe it's an alcohol, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak would be even broader. Hmm, but the question says it's a very broad absorption. I think that's more indicative of an -OH group, perhaps as in an alcohol.

Wait, but the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So looking at the degrees of unsaturation might help. Let's calculate each option's degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12. So (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So 1 degree. That could be one ring or one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. (12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Maybe one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. So same as A.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond. Let's see:

Looking at the options:

A: 1 DoU. So either a ring or a double bond. But wait, FTIR shows a C=C peak, so maybe a double bond, but then where's the ring? Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps the mass spec will help. The mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. What fragments have 45? Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COO- (like an ethoxide group), but wait, 45 would be C2H5O2^+? Or maybe something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2COH? No, that's more than 45. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C2H5O2^+? Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So C2H5O2: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 2*16=32. 24+5=29 +32=61. No, that's too heavy. Wait, perhaps it's a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a ketone or ester.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion (M) would be the molecular weight of the compound. Let me see what the molecular weights of the options are.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: 6*12=72 +12*1=12 +2*16=32. So 72+12=84 +32=116. So M would be 116. But the fragment is 45, which is less than that.

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12=72 +10*1=10 +16=16. 72+10=82 +16=98. So M=98. Fragment at 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. 6*12=72 +10*1=10 + 2*16=32. Total 72+10=82 +32=114. So M=114. Fragment at 45.

Option D: C6H12O. 6*12=72 +12=12 +16=16. 72+12=84 +16=100. M=100.

So the fragment is at 45, which is lower than all the options. So perhaps it's a fragment from the molecule. Let's think about what 45 could be. 45 is 45 g/mol.

45 could be (CH3)2COH, which is 58. No. Wait, perhaps it's a fragment like CH2CH2O... Wait, thinking in terms of common fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)3CO^+? Let's see: (CH3)3CO would be C4H9O. That's 4*12=48 +9=9 +16=16. 48+9=57 +16=73. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe an acylium ion. Or maybe a ketone fragment. Another possibility: the fragment could be an ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see possible combinations:

C: number of carbons. 45 = 12a + 1b + 16c. Let me think: 45 as CO2 is 44, but that's 44. So maybe something like CH3COO- is 59. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, maybe a fragment of a ketone like acetone. Acetone is (propanone) C3H6O. Its molecular weight is 58 (3*12=36, 6=6, 16=16. 36+6=42+16=58). So 58. So if the fragment is 45, perhaps a smaller piece.

Wait, 45 could be CH3CH2O^+ (ethoxy group). Let's calculate that: CH3CH2O has a molecular weight of 12*2 + 1*5 + 16 = 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! Yes, that's 45. So a fragment at m/z 45 could be an ethoxy group (CH2CH3O^+). So if the compound has an ethoxy group, then perhaps it's an ester or an ether. Wait, but the options don't include any with a higher O count except the O2 options.

Wait, let's tie this together.

The compound has an -OH group, a carbonyl group, a conjugated double bond, and an ethoxy group? Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

So IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (probably -OH). Peaks at 1700 and 1650 (maybe a conjugated carbonyl and C=C). NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. Mass spec has a fragment at 45, which is CH2CH2O (45). So perhaps the compound is an ester, since esters can cleave to form an ethoxy group.

Wait, but looking at the options, which have two oxygen atoms? Options A and C. A is C6H12O2, and C is C6H10O2. So both have two oxygen atoms, which would fit esters or ketones with an -OH or something.

Wait, an ester would have a carbonyl and an ether linkage. So the structure could be something like R-O-CO-R'. That would give two oxygen atoms. Also, if it's an ester, then in the mass spec, the ethoxy group could come off as a fragment, giving m/z 45.

So let's consider an ester. The ester group would have a carbonyl peak at around 1700, which matches the IR data. The conjugated carbonyl might be part of a double bond, so perhaps the ester is part of a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would explain the C=C peak at 1650.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, where R is some alkyl group. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone.

But the molecular formula needs to have two oxygens. So, let's think about the options again. If it's an ester, the formula would have two oxygens. So options A and C.

Now, looking at the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one ring or one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So option C has two DoU. That would allow for a double bond and perhaps a ring. Or another double bond.

But the mass spec fragment of 45 suggests an ethoxy group, which has two carbons. Let me think about the ester. An ethyl ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R', where R' is ethyl. Then, the ester group would have the oxygen count right. So in the mass spec, losing the ethyl group as a fragment would give m/z 45.

Wait, but the molecular formula of the unknown is one of these. Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. 6*12=72 +12=12 +32=116. So molecular ion at 116. But the fragment is 45, which is less than that, so possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. 6*12=72 +10=10 +32=114. So M=114. Fragment at 45 is possible as part of it.

Now, let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens would mean that the compound has a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond. If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, that would fit the IR and NMR data.

So the structure could be something like methyl vinyl ester. For example, an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

If the structure is an ester, let's imagine it's something like CH2=CHCOO-R. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon ester. Alternatively, perhaps a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester, but that's getting more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that might not necessarily produce the ethoxy fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted benzene with an ester group. But the options don't have benzene rings, I think, since the formula is C6Hsomething, which could be a benzene ring (which would have three double bonds, but let's recalculate the DoU for benzene.)

Wait, if the structure is benzene with some substituents. Benzene has three DoU (from the three double bonds). So if the compound is C6H10O2, that would have two DoU. But benzene itself is 3 DoU. That doesn't add up, so perhaps it's not an aromatic compound.

So back to the ester idea. Let's say the molecule is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. Let's see what the formula would be.

Wait, let's try to model this. Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate). The formula would be C5H8O2. But the options are C6H12O2, etc. So perhaps a bigger ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester or a more complex structure.

Wait, but the options are C6H12O2 and others. Let me see: for a six-carbon ester, maybe it's something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate? Not sure, but perhaps it's a ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a four-membered ring, but that's C4H6O2. Not matching.

Wait, but the options are C6H12O2, etc. Let me try to count the carbons. If the structure is an ester with one oxygen, but with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ketone with an ester group, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a broad peak in IR suggests a strong hydrogen bond donor, like an -OH group. So it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But earlier I thought it's an alcohol because of the NMR not showing a broad peak, but wait, carboxylic acids have very broad peaks and often show up as a singlet in the NMR, but in this case, the question says the NMR has several peaks, including those for vinyl hydrogens. So maybe it's an alcohol.

Wait, but then O would be one. Let me look at the options again. Options B and D have O=1. Options A and C have O=2.

If the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group and a double bond, then the formula would have one oxygen. But in that case, the IR would have a broad peak (alcohol -OH) and a carbonyl peak. But then, the two oxygen options (A and C) would have an ester or other group with two oxygens.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require O=2, since ketone (O=1) and alcohol (O=1) would sum to O=2.

So let's think: the compound has both a ketone and an alcohol group. Then, the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C). Let's look at the molecular formulas.

If it's a diol with a ketone, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexanol acetate, which would be an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but esters are O=2. So that would fit options A or C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this step by step.

1. FTIR:

- Broad peak ~3000 cm^-1: -OH group.

- Peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1: likely carbonyl and conjugated double bond.

2. NMR:

- Vinyl hydrogens: presence of a double bond.

3. Mass Spec:

- Fragment at m/z 45: likely CH2CH2O^+ (ethoxy group).

So the compound likely has an ethoxy group. Which options have ethoxy? Well, looking at the options, ethoxy would be part of an ester or ether.

But the options are:

A) C6H12O2: could be an ester.

B) C6H10O: ether, but unlikely to have a fragment of 45.

C) C6H10O2: could be an ester or another oxygen-containing group.

D) C6H12O: alcohol, but probably not with an ethoxy fragment.

So the presence of an ethoxy group (fragment 45) suggests an ester, which has two oxygen atoms. Thus, options A and C are candidates.

Now, looking at the degrees of unsaturation.

Option A: DoU=1. So one ring or one double bond.

Option C: DoU=2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond, so option A would have one DoU, which could be a double bond. Option C would have two DoU, which could include a double bond and another (like a ring, or another double bond).

The IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So in an ester, this is the carbonyl.

The IR peak at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, or a C=C adjacent to the carbonyl. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, that would explain both the 1700 and 1650 peaks.

So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group.

Let's model this. For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Its formula is C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A).

So perhaps the ester is a six-carbon compound. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate or something else. But without the benzene ring, perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the ester would be RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups.

The general formula for an ester is Cn+1+m H2n+2+2m O2. Wait, perhaps better to think as RCOOR' being (n carbons from RCOO) + m carbons from R'.

But perhaps it's easier to think of specific examples.

If the ester is, say, methyl pentenoate, the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: pentenoate is CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. The formula is C6H10O2, which matches option C.

Alternatively, another structure.

So, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH3, which is methyl 3-pentenoate, the formula would be C6H10O2.

That fits option C. Let's check the degrees of unsaturation for C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So DoU=2. Which would come from the double bond (1) and the ester group (which is a ring of sorts, but actually it's a double bond in the ester's carbonyl. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', which has a carbonyl group (one DoU) and the double bond in the ester is the carbonyl, so the other double bond from the vinyl group contributes the second DoU. So yes, that gives two DoU.

So the structure would have a conjugated double bond (the vinyl group) and the ester's carbonyl. That explains the IR peaks at 1700 (ester carbonyl) and 1650 (conjugated C=C). The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (the CH2=CH group), and the mass spectrum would show a fragment at 45 (CH2CH3O^+ from the ethyl group, but wait, in this example, it's a methyl ester (OCH3). Oh wait, no. If the ester is methyl, then the ethyl group wouldn't be present. Hmm, but the fragment is 45, which corresponds to CH2CH2O^+ (45). So perhaps the ester is ethyl something.

Wait, so if the ester is ethyl propenoate, structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Formula is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (12*6 +2 -10)/2 = (72+2=74-10=64)/2=32? Wait, wait, no, degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C6H10O2: (12 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)=4/2=2. So two DoU.

So the structure would have a double bond and a carbonyl. So the FTIR would show both peaks, which it does.

Now, the mass spec. If the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), the molecular weight is (3 carbons from CH2=CHCOO) + 2 from ethyl: 5 carbons? Wait, no, the formula is C5H8O2. Wait, our options are C6H10O2.

Hmm, perhaps another structure. Let's think of a six-carbon ester with a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's hex-3-en-1-yl ethyl ester? Wait, not sure. Let me count the carbons: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 is 2 (from CH2=CH) + 3 (from COOCH2CH3?), no, wait, COO is two oxygens. Wait, the formula would be:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3: that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 3 (CH2COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 2+3+2=7 carbons. No, that's too many. So that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the ester is a four-carbon with a double bond. But I'm getting stuck. Let's think again about the mass spec.

The fragment at 45 is CH2CH2O^+ (45 g/mol), so that's an ethoxy group. So the ester must be ethyl something. So the ester is RCOOCH2CH3. So the R group is, say, CH2=CHCH2-. Then, RCOO would be CH2=CHCH2COO-. So the formula would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's 2 (CH2=CH) + 3 (CH2COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 7 carbons. No, that's too many. So perhaps a shorter chain.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's ethyl acrylate. Formula: (3 carbons in acrylate) + (2 in ethyl) = 5 carbons. But our options are six carbons. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula of the unknown is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then the molecular weight is 114. The mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So the rest would be 114 -45=69. Hmm, I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not an ester. Maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone. But then the O count would be two.

Another possibility is a diketone, but that would have two carbonyl peaks. But the IR in the question has two peaks, but I'm not sure if that's two different carbonyl groups or an overtone.

Wait, the IR peaks are at 1700 and 1650. So the 1700 is a strong carbonyl, and 1650 could be another carbonyl in a conjugated system, which would fit with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, the O count would be one, but the options would require O=2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize the data:

- IR: -OH (broad), carbonyl (1700), conjugated C=C (1650).

- NMR: vinyl hydrogens.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45 (CH2CH2O^+).

So the compound must have an ethoxy group (from the fragment), a carbonyl, and a conjugated double bond.

So the structure is likely an ethyl ester with a conjugated double bond.

So the molecular formula would be RCOOCH2CH3, where R has a double bond.

If R is CH2CH=CHCH2-, then RCOO would be CH2CH=CHCH2COO-. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Wait, let's count:

R is CH2CH=CHCH2: that's 4 carbons.

RCOOCH2CH3: 4 (R) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 8? No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps R is CH2=CHCH2-, so RCOO would be CH2=CHCH2COO-. Then RCOOCH2CH3 is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's 5 carbons from RCOO and 2 from ethyl, total 7. No, too many.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The options are limited, so perhaps I can eliminate some based on the data.

Option D: C6H12O. So O=1. If the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl, that would require O=2. So perhaps not.

Option B: C6H10O. O=1. Same issue as D.

So the likely candidates are A and C.

Now, between A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

If the structure is an ester, then it must have a carbonyl and an oxygen from the ester group.

The presence of a conjugated double bond would mean that the ester is alpha,beta-unsaturated, which explains the IR peaks.

Now, the molecular formula for option C (C6H10O2) has two less hydrogens than option A.

In an ester, the general formula is CnH2nO2. Wait, no, wait: esters are RCOOR', so the formula is (n carbons in RCOO) + (m carbons in R'). So the total is (n + m + 2) for RCOOR' (since R is (n-1) carbons, RCOO is n carbons, and R' is m carbons). So the formula becomes Cn+m+2 H2(n + m) O2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, for RCOOR', where R is (n) carbons and R' is (m) carbons, the formula is (n + m + 2) carbons (n from R, 1 from COO, m from R'). Wait, no.

Wait, the ester RCOOR' has:

- R: (n) carbons.

- COO: 2 oxygen, 2 carbons.

- R': (m) carbons.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of specific examples.

Ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. Formula is C4H8O2.

So for ethyl acetate:

n = 2 (from CH3COO), m = 2 (from ethyl). So total carbons: 2 (from CH3COO) + 2 (from ethyl) =4.

Hydrogens: 3 (CH3) + 2*2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (the O connects them) ? No, perhaps better to count.

CH3COOCH2CH3: 

CH3 (3 H), COO (no H), CH2CH3 (5 H). So total H is 3 + 5 = 8, but wait, the structure is CH3COOCH2CH3. The carbonyl is between CH3 and O. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH3

So the CH3 group has 3 H, the COO has no H, and the ethyl group has 2 CH2 groups with 2 and 3 H, respectively. So total H: 3 (CH3) + 2 (CH2) + 3 (CH3) = 8. So formula is C4H8O2.

So for an ester RCOOR', the general formula is Cn+2 + m H2n+2m +2 O2? Wait, perhaps better to model it as RCOOR' = (n carbons) + (m carbons) = (n + m + 2) because RCOO is n +1 (since R is n-1). Maybe I'm not getting this right.

But going back, the options are:

A) C6H12O2: DoU=1.

C) C6H10O2: DoU=2.

So for an ester, the formula would be something like CnH2nO2.

Wait, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2, which matches CnH2nO2 where n=4.

So if the ester is C6H12O2, that would suggest n=6, 2n=12 H. So if the ester is C6H12O2, it would be a saturated ester. But wait, the IR shows a conjugated double bond, so it's not saturated.

Alternatively, if the ester is unsaturated, like alpha,beta-unsaturated, then the formula would have fewer H.

So for a six-carbon ester with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2 (since each double bond reduces H by 2).

So option C is C6H10O2. That would fit an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So putting it all together:

- IR shows -OH (broad), carbonyl (1700), and conjugated C=C (1650).

- NMR shows vinyl H.

- Mass spec shows ethoxy fragment (45).

So the compound is likely an ethyl ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, but looking back, option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So one from the double bond, and one from the carbonyl. That matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.

       \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1
       \]
       This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring.
     - For **C₆H₁₀O**:  
       \[
       \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2
       \]
       This indicates two degrees of unsaturation, which could correspond to a combination of a double bond and a ring.
     - For **C₆H₁₀O₂**:  
       \[
       \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2
       \]
       This also indicates two degrees of unsaturation.
     - For **C₆H₁₂O**:  
       \[
       \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1
       \]
       This indicates one degree of unsaturation.

5. **Integration of Data**:
   - The **FTIR data** suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond (C=C), which aligns with the **¹H NMR data** showing vinyl hydrogens.
   - The **mass spectrometry data** indicates the presence of an ethoxy group (CH₃CH₂O⁺), which is consistent with an ester functional group.
   - The compound must have two oxygen atoms to accommodate both the -OH group and the ester functional group, narrowing the options to **A (C₆H₁₂O₂)** and **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**.
   - The **degrees of unsaturation** for **C₆H₁₀O₂** (DoU = 2) are consistent with the presence of both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, as indicated by the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies all the spectroscopic data and functional group requirements.
