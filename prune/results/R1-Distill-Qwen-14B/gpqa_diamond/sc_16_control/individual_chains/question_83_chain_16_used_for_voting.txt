Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have to choose the correct pair of pH values.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentrations. Wait, when we dilute the acetic acid with water, the concentration will change. So, before anything else, I should calculate the concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2.

So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that. 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction will be between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which provides OH-). The reaction equation is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, first, let's find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, but we have to consider the diluted solution. So the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: concentration is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence point is also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So at 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required NaOH. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So at 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH needed has been added. So for each 1 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 mol/L * (cm³ in liters) → 0.1 M * 0.001 L = 0.0001 moles per cm³. So 2.5 cm³ is 0.0001 * 2.5 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

So, the moles of acetic acid and acetate in solution?

Initially, we have 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of acetic acid to acetate.

So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume is the original diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³.

So concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, to find the pH at this point, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Wait, let me compute that ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with calculations.

Let me compute the ratio more accurately.

Moles of acetate = 0.00025; HA (acetic acid) = 0.00075.

So ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333333.

So log(1/3) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256.

So around 4.26. So the 25% titration pH is approximately 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to acetate. So the solution would be a solution of sodium acetate, a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The concentration of acetate would be the moles divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles.

Total volume: original 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ NaOH (since equivalence is 10 cm³ added) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, to find the pH of this solution, we can set up the expression.

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 ≈ (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Calculating log(3.288) ≈ 0.5166, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5166 -6 = -5.4834. So pOH ≈ 5.4834.

Then pH = 14 - 5.4834 ≈ 8.5166.

So pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A says pH 4.26 and 8.52. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes?

At 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26. At equivalence, around 8.52.

So option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but wait. What about the dilution during the equivalence point? Because when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ solution, total is 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, which is correct.

And Kb calculation is correct. So the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.

So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the diluted concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The moles are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

For the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH required to neutralize all the acetic acid are equal to the moles of acetic acid, i.e., 0.001 moles. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{moles}}{M} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acetic acid (40 cm³) and the added NaOH (10 cm³), giving a total volume of 50 cm³. The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of acetate}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \) by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x \) is the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \), we find:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 \approx 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the required NaOH (2.5 cm³) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is now \( 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

From the calculations, the pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52.**
