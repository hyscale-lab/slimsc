      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting a specific value, which is 0. \n\nAlright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but I should probably normalize that state vector because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length squared is 1. Let me calculate the norm first. The elements are -1, 2, and 1. So the square of each is 1, 4, and 1. Adding them gives 6. So the norm is sqrt(6), right? So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Oh wait, wait, the question just gives the column matrix, but maybe it's already normalized? Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6. So yeah, the state vector has a length squared of 6. So the actual state is (1/sqrt(6)) times that column. So I have to keep that in mind for the calculations.\n\nNext, the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write it down. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. Third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the matrix looks like:\n\n0   1/\u221a2   0\n1/\u221a2 0   1/\u221a2\n0   1/\u221a2 0\n\nHmm, what's the structure of this matrix? It looks symmetric, which is good because observables are Hermitian. Wait, yes, because the elements are real and symmetric. So that's a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that measuring P yields 0. So in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is 0.\n\nWait, but let me think about how to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I don't need to find all the eigenvalues. Because the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue (here 0) is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible results are the eigenvalues, and 0 is one of them. Let me find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it more clearly.\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix.\n\nHmm, for a 3x3 matrix, the determinant can be a bit involved. Let me try expanding it along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] )\n- (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n+ 0 * something (so this term drops out)\n\nSo let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst term is -\u03bb multiplied by the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:\n(-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSecond term is - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of another 2x2 matrix:\n[[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n [0, -\u03bb]]\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2 * (-\u03bb)) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) ) = (-\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\nSo putting it together:\n\ndet = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ] - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) \n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst part: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond part: -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nSo the entire determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSet this equal to zero: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 ) =0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb =0, \u03bb=1, and \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So the equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of getting 0.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability is the square of the absolute value of the component of the state vector along the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, the state we have is given as (-1, 2, 1). But earlier I thought it wasn't normalized. Because the sum of squares is 6, so the state is (1/sqrt(6)) times that vector. So the actual state is a vector |\u03c8> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nBut to find the probability, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of matrix P, then compute the inner product of |\u03c8> with that eigenvector, square the absolute value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the state in the eigenbasis of P and find the coefficient for the 0 eigenvalue eigenstate.\n\nBut perhaps first, let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, particularly for 0.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 0:\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0, which is P |v> =0.\n\nSo the matrix becomes P again.\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3 )=0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation:0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first, v2=0.\n\nSo the solutions are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) where v1 is a parameter.\n\nTo make it a unit vector, we can set v1=1/sqrt(2), so the eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nv1 = a, v2=0, v3= -a.\n\nNormalizing: a^2 + 0 + a^2 = 2 a^2 =1 \u2192 a=1/sqrt(2). So yes, the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.\n\nSo the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, our state |\u03c8> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is |<v|\u03c8>|^2.\n\nSo let's compute the inner product between |v> and |\u03c8>.\n\n|v> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo <v|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = same as first term, so (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding these: (-1)/(2\u221a3) + (-1)/(2\u221a3) = (-2)/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/\u221a3. The absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that's option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product calculation. Let me double-check.\n\n|v> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\n|\u03c8> is [-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)].\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is:\n\n(-1)/(sqrt(12)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nsqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so each term is (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding together: (-1 -1)/(2 sqrt(3)) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3).\n\nTaking the absolute value squared gives (1/3). So 1/3 is the probability.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the value \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe state vector is given as \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Its norm is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state vector is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). The matrix \\( P - \\lambda I \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP - \\lambda I = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\lambda\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nExpanding the determinant and solving yields the eigenvalues \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), solve \\( P |v\\rangle = 0 \\). The system of equations is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \\), we get \\( v_2 = 0 \\). From \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0 \\), we get \\( v_3 = -v_1 \\). The eigenvector is:\n\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the probability\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) and \\( |v\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value squared is:\n\n\\[\n|\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C) \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)**",
