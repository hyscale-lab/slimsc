Both systems exhibit eclipses with orbital periods \\( P \\), and their radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are provided. The key relationship between mass and velocity in a binary system is derived from the center of mass condition: \n\n\\[\nm_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two stars, and \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are their respective velocity amplitudes. This implies that the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Mass Ratios for Each System\nFor **system_1**, the velocity amplitudes are \\( v_1 = 10 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( v_2 = 5 \\, \\text{km/s} \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThe total mass of system_1 is:\n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{system_1}} = m_1 + m_2 = m_2 + 0.5m_2 = 1.5m_2\n\\]\n\nFor **system_2**, the velocity amplitudes are \\( v_1 = 15 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( v_2 = 10 \\, \\text{km/s} \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe total mass of system_2 is:\n\n\\[\nM_{\\text{system_2}} = m_1 + m_2 = m_2 + \\frac{2}{3}m_2 = \\frac{5}{3}m_2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Ratio of Total Masses\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we compute the ratio of their total masses:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{M_{\\text{system_1}}}{M_{\\text{system_2}}} = \\frac{1.5m_2}{\\frac{5}{3}m_2} = \\frac{1.5}{\\frac{5}{3}} = 1.5 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 0.9\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Refinement Using Orbital Period\nThe total mass of a binary system can also be expressed using Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[\nM + m = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G P^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the separation between the stars and \\( P \\) is the orbital period. The separation \\( a \\) can be related to the velocity amplitudes and the period:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{v_1 P}{2\\pi} + \\frac{v_2 P}{2\\pi} = \\frac{(v_1 + v_2) P}{2\\pi}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a \\) into the mass formula, the total mass becomes proportional to:\n\n\\[\nM + m \\propto (v_1 + v_2)^3 P\n\\]\n\nFor **system_1**:\n\\[\nv_1 + v_2 = 10 + 5 = 15, \\quad P = 2 \\, \\text{years}\n\\]\n\\[\nM_{\\text{system_1}} \\propto 15^3 \\cdot 2 = 3375 \\cdot 2 = 6750\n\\]\n\nFor **system_2**:\n\\[\nv_1 + v_2 = 15 + 10 = 25, \\quad P = 1 \\, \\text{year}\n\\]\n\\[\nM_{\\text{system_2}} \\propto 25^3 \\cdot 1 = 15625 \\cdot 1 = 15625\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the total masses is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{M_{\\text{system_1}}}{M_{\\text{system_2}}} = \\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately \\( 0.4 \\), which corresponds to option **A**.\n\n**Answer: A**"
