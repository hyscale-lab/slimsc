The analysis of the options is as follows:\n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. **Directing Effects**:\n   - **Nitro (-NO\u2082)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n   - **Bromine (-Br)**: Weakly deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n   - **Acetyl (-COCH\u2083)**: Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n   - The order of introduction of substituents determines their positions due to the directing effects of the existing groups.\n\n2. **Target Structure**:\n   - The target molecule has:\n     - **Acetyl group (-COCH\u2083)** at position 1.\n     - **Bromo group (-Br)** at position 3.\n     - **Nitro group (-NO\u2082)** at position 5.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n#### **Option A**:\n- Steps include acylation, bromination, nitration, and reduction.\n- Introducing the nitro group twice is unnecessary and would lead to multiple nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure.\n- **Eliminated**.\n\n#### **Option B**:\n- Steps include bromination, nitration, acylation, and reduction.\n- After bromination (position 1) and nitration (position 2 or 4), acylation would occur at position 6, leading to substituents at positions 1 (Br), 2 (NO\u2082), and 6 (COCH\u2083). This does not match the target structure.\n- **Eliminated**.\n\n#### **Option C**:\n- Steps include nitration, reduction, acylation, bromination, and nitration.\n- After nitration (position 1), reduction converts the nitro group to an amine (-NH\u2082). Acylation then occurs at position 3 (ortho to -NH\u2082). Bromination would place -Br at position 5 (meta to -NH\u2082 and ortho to -COCH\u2083). This matches the target structure.\n- **Consistent with the target**.\n\n#### **Option D**:\n- Steps include nitration, reduction, diazotization, and multiple substitutions.\n- The sequence involves introducing a hydroxyl group and bromine, followed by acylation and nitration. This sequence is overly complex and does not clearly lead to the desired substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n- **Eliminated**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption C provides the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The steps ensure that the substituents are introduced in the correct positions, guided by the directing effects of the existing groups.\n\n**Answer: C**"
