A precipitate \\( G \\) forms, which upon heating releases \\( B \\), with \\( B \\)'s melting point near 277 K. Additionally, the product of \\( X \\) reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, and \\( X \\) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The task is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in \\( X \\), considering isotopes.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Gas \\( W \\)**: The molecule of \\( W \\) has an equal number of protons and neutrons. CO\u2082 is a plausible candidate, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons.\n2. **Precipitate \\( G \\)**: Heating \\( G \\) releases \\( B \\), which has a melting point near 277 K. This suggests \\( B \\) could be water (H\u2082O), as it melts at 273 K.\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product contains two oxygen atoms, indicating a carboxylate salt like sodium acetate.\n4. **Substance \\( X \\)**: Considering \\( X \\) is a reagent in organic chemistry, Na\u2082CO\u2083 is a likely candidate. The elements are Na, C, and O. The lightest element is C (12), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 35.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in \\( X \\) (Na\u2082CO\u2083) sum to 35.\n\n**Answer: A**"
