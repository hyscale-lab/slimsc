The products are then analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  \n   - (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized by mCPBA to form a trans-epoxide.  \n   - Under acidic conditions, the trans-epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol.  \n   - The diol from the trans-epoxide is a meso compound (achiral) due to its plane of symmetry.  \n   - Thus, Reaction 1 produces a single achiral diol.\n\n2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  \n   - (Z)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized by mCPBA to form a cis-epoxide.  \n   - Under acidic conditions, the cis-epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol.  \n   - The diol from the cis-epoxide is chiral and forms a racemic mixture (50:50 mixture of two enantiomers).  \n   - Thus, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\n3. **Combining the Products**  \n   - The combined product mixture contains:  \n     - A single achiral meso diol (from Reaction 1).  \n     - A racemic mixture of two enantiomers (from Reaction 2).  \n\n4. **HPLC Analysis**  \n   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**:  \n     - The meso diol appears as a single peak.  \n     - The racemic mixture of enantiomers appears as a single peak because achiral columns cannot resolve enantiomers.  \n     - Total peaks: **2**.  \n\n   - **Chiral HPLC**:  \n     - The meso diol appears as a single peak because it is achiral.  \n     - The racemic mixture of enantiomers separates into two distinct peaks.  \n     - Total peaks: **3**.  \n\n5. **Conclusion**  \n   - The standard HPLC shows **2 peaks**, and the chiral HPLC shows **3 peaks**.  \n\n**Correct Answer**: B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.  \nAnswer: B"
