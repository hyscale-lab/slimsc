Mitochondria do not directly take up glucose, making this experiment irrelevant for studying mitochondrial function. Thus, this experiment will not help.\n\n- **Option B**: Luciferase assays measure ATP levels, which are directly related to mitochondrial energy production. This experiment would help determine if the drug affects mitochondrial ATP production.\n\n- **Option C**: JC-1 measures mitochondrial membrane potential, a critical function of mitochondria. Changes caused by the drug would be detected, making it relevant.\n\n- **Option D**: Mito-RTP staining assesses mitochondrial ROS production, a key function. This experiment would help determine if the drug affects mitochondrial ROS levels, making it relevant.\n\nSince Option A focuses on glucose uptake, which is unrelated to mitochondrial function, it will not help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug.\n\n**Answer: A**"
