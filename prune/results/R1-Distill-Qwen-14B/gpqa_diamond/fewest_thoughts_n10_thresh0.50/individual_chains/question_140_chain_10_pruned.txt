Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. They react violently and release a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, which is interesting. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another part mentions a product from a keto acid reacting with X, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and possibly some other products. When G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is around 4Â°C, so B might be a solid at that temperature.

Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, the molecule must be something like H2O, NH3, CO2? Wait, let me think: the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For a molecule, each atom contributes. So maybe H2O: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. The total protons:
