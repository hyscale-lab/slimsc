Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the speed of light in a moving glass relative to an observer. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the speed depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed of light is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. In this case, c is given as 1, so v_medium should be 1/n. But wait, that's the speed in the glass when the glass is stationary. What happens when the glass itself is moving?

Hmm, I think when the medium is moving relative to the observer, you have to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Because light is involved, and velocities can't just be added classically; you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). Wait, in this case, what is u? Normally, u is the velocity of the object in the rest frame of the original frame. But wait, in this situation, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through the glass.
