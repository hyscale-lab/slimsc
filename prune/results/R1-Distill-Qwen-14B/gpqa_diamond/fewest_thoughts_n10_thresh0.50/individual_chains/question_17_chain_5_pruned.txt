Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration is given as 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So, if I know the concentration of the complex and the K value, I can find the product of [Ca²+] and [EDTA], and maybe find each individually.

But wait, in this solution, the total EDTA is part of the complex, right? So, the initial EDTA concentration is all part of the complex. But when it complexes with Ca²+, some of the EDTA is in the complex form. So, does that mean that the concentration of free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex?

Hmm, given that K is 5e10, which is a large number, that suggests that the complex is very stable. So, the majority of EDTA will be tied up in the complex, and the free [EDTA] and [Ca²+] will be very low.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric usually means that the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So, for every mole of Ca-EDTA complex, there's one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA. So the initial concentrations are such that when they form the complex, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

But in solution, the complex dissociates a bit. So, the actual [Ca²+] is much lower than 0.02 M. Because only a small amount dissociates.

Let me think step by step. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, because
