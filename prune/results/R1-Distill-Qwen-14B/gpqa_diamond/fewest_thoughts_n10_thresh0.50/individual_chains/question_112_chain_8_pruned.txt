Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem states: We have an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator's matrix representation has elements Aij. The rule is Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so that's a 2x2 matrix since the states are |up> and |down>, making it two eigenstates. Let me think about what this matrix looks like.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are 0 (since i=j gives 0), and the off-diagonal elements A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, that's a symmetric matrix, which makes sense because operators in quantum mechanics are Hermitian. So this operator is likely related to the spin in the x or y direction. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is similar but without the hbar/2 factor. Since this matrix has hbar/2 in the off-diagonal, maybe it's the operator (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is σx. Because σx has 1s in the off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times σx. That would have eigenstates that are the eigenstates of σx, which are the eigenstates of the X operator. But wait, the problem says to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So |alpha> is written in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So to find the probabilities, we need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator in question, which is the σx eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is something else. Let me think again. If the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], then it's a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

But before getting into that, maybe I should first normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So I need to normalize it to find the actual state.

So the state is |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 = (1+i) and c2 = (2 - i). The norm is |c1|^2 + |
