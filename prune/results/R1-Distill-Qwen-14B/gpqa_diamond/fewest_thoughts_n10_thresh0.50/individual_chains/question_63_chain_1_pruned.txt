Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I need to find the momentum of a photon that causes a molecule to move to the next lowest energy state. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The molecule is diatomic, made of atoms X and Y. The given masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need a photon to switch it to the next lowest state.

Wait, so the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state in terms of quantum numbers?

In the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2)ħω, and the rotational as (J(J+1)ħ²/(2I)), where J is the rotational quantum number.

But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that means the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. Since the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart (because they involve the stiffer potential, higher frequency), perhaps the lowest energy transition would be a vibrational one. But wait, no, because for diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are usually considered in the context of the rigid rotor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state could be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because if the photon must cause the molecule to go to the next lowest state, it's the one with the least energy difference.

The energy difference for the vibrational transition (from v=0 to v=1) would be ΔE_vib = ħω. For rotational, the energy difference is the energy between J=0 and
