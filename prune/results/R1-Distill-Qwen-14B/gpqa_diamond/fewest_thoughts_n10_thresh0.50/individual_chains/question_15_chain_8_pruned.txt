Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, which tells us their minimum masses and orbital periods. But their masses are the same, so that part's equal.

Wait, the key here is transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, squared. Or wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital distance relative to the star's size. Let me think.

Oh right, the transit probability (p) can be approximated by p = (R_star / a)^2 * ( (R_planet / R_star) )^2. Wait no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. So the probability that a planet transits is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. The probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, squared. Because the planet's orbit has to be in the plane we're viewing it from. So the geometric probability is p = (R_star / a)^2, where a
