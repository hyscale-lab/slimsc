Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. Hmm, so the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two planets, each around stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune.

The question is about the orbital periods of the planets. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the planet's mass and orbital period somehow. 

So, planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are given, and I need to find the correct ratio.

Wait, I think the RV method's shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like v = (2π G M_p sin i) / (P (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ). But since M_p is much less than M_star (the planets are Neptune mass and stars are Sun-like), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. 

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P )^(1/3). Wait, no, let's think again. The velocity K is related to the other parameters. The formula I've read before is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (something with c? No, perhaps not. Let me think of the exact relation.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) * (1 / (2 π c)) )^(1/ something) )
