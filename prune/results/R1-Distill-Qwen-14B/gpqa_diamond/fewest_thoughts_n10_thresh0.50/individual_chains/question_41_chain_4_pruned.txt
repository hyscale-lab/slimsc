Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And c is given as 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Wait, right, the speed of light in a medium like glass is v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving. So I think I need to consider the effect of the medium's motion on the observed speed of light.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way they transform under Lorentz transformations. Oh wait, but wait, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame, right? But wait, that's in a vacuum, isn't it? Or does it apply here too?

Wait, the light is inside the glass, so its speed in the glass is c/n. But the glass itself is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So, do I need to apply the velocity addition formula from relativity?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the rest frame of the glass, light is moving at c/n. But the lab frame is moving relative to the glass. So, perhaps I should use
