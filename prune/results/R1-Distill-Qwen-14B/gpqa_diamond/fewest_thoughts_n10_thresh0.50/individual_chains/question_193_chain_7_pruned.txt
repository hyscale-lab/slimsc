Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. The given relation is that the number varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Oh wait, so N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Right, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, the standard formula I remember is that distance d is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in parsecs. So d ≈ 1/plx. So if parallax plx is in arcseconds, then converting to parsecs, yeah, d (parsecs) = 1/plx (arcseconds). So, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The question is about how the number of stars varies with distance. So, I need to express the number of stars as a function of distance and then find how it scales. Let's think about it step by step.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Wait, no, plx is equal to 1/d, right? Because plx = 1/d (parsec). So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

So substituting back into N, which is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that
