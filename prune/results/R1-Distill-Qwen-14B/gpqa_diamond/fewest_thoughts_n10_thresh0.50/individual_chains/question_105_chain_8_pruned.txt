Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about stars with spots and how they affect photometric observations, which could be mistaken for an exoplanet. Interesting. So, the question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots.

Alright, let me break this down. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is about the same as R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler since they have a temperature difference of 1000K. Wait, does that mean the spots are at 5000K or 7000K? Oh, wait, no. Since the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, the spots must be at 5000K (because 6000K minus 1000K is 5000K).

The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So, 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 (filling factor) multiplied by the area of half the star. Because only one hemisphere is affected.

Wait, let me think again. The star's total surface area is 4πR². If one hemisphere is covered, that's 2πR². And 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area of spots is 0.4πR². Because filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere, right.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, the maximum change in brightness would happen when the spots are either fully visible or fully hidden as the star rotates. But wait, because the star is a sphere, when you look at it, the spots on one hemisphere would be visible as the star rotates into and out of view. So the brightness variation is due to the spots moving in and out of the observed hemisphere. Hmm, but the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So when the spots are on the approaching side
