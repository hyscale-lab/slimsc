Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me think through what I know about parallax and how stars are distributed.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, meaning their density in space is the same everywhere. So, I don't have to worry about more stars being in certain areas. The main thing to figure out is how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds), so distance d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because nearby stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's say we're looking at a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are in that range? Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is constant. But parallax relates to distance, so the volume of space we're considering at a certain distance affects how many stars we see.

Density is number per unit volume, so if the number density n is constant, then the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV. But we need to relate this to parallax.

Let me think about how volume relates to parallax. The volume of a spherical shell (a thin layer of space at a distance d) with radius d and thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π r³, so the difference between d and d + dd is approximately 4π d² dd (using calculus, derivative of r³ with respect to r is 3r², so the volume element is 4π d² dd).

Since d = 1 / plx, I can substitute that. So, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx is decreasing as d is increasing. Let me make sure about the signs. If plx increases, the star is closer, so d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd. So, the relation between dd and dplx is dd = -d² dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx)^2 dplx.

Wait, perhaps I should express d in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx. So, dd (the change in d) is -1/(plx)^2 dplx. Because d is decreasing as plx increases. So, the volume element dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx). Wait, but if I consider the absolute volume, the negative sign might not matter because we're considering positive ranges. Let me think: if I'm considering a small increase in plx (dplx positive), then d is decreasing, so dd is negative. But when I take the absolute value, it's positive. So, the volume element is 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx? Wait, no, because dd is -d^2 dplx. No, let me re-calculate.

Wait, maybe it's better to express dV in terms of plx. So, dV is the volume of the shell between plx and plx + dplx. Hmm, no, wait: plx is a function of distance. So, as we go from d to d + dd, plx goes from plx to plx + dplx. Wait, no, because plx is 1/d. So, if d increases by dd, plx changes by dplx = - (dd) * (1/d²) because dplx = d d(1/d) )= - dd / d². So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume element dV (which is
