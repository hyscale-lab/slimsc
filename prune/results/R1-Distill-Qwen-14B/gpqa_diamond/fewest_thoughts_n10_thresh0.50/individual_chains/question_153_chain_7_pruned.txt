Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates attacking alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds. 

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a different Michael addition reaction. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Let me start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

So dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid, which is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The base, NaOEt, should deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, wait, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But wait, E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something else. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the substituent is on the third carbon? Hmm, perhaps it's (E)- configuration, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. So structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, but wait, that can't be
