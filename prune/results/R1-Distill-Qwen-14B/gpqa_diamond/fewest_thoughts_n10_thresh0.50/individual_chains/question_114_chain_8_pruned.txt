Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution when they have a good leaving group, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition reaction?

Wait, no, wait. Oh, right! I think when you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone has a carbonyl group, which is electrophilic. The cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to an addition product. But wait, how does that form the product given here?

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. So, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The butanenitrile would be a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group. So structure-wise, it's CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Or wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let's see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2
