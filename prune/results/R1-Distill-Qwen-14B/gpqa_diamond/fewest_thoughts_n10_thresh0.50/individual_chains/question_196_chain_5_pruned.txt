Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question asks for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh wait, right, the options are given, so I can compare my reasoning to them.

First, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed depends on the amplitude and the spring constant. The formula is something like v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So in the non-relativistic case, that's option C. But since the question is relativistic, I guess we have to consider relativistic effects, so option C might not be the answer here.

Wait, in relativity, as an object's speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic mass increases. Oh, right, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So the energy equations would change.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². In the relativistic case, the total energy E would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Or wait, is it? Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma times m c², which includes rest energy and kinetic energy.

So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x = A, all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all that energy is converted into kinetic. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait. In the relativistic scenario, when the mass is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², but the total energy is gamma m c². Hmm, no, because the mass would be moving the fastest at x=0, so the kinetic energy is highest there. Let me try to write down the energy expressions.

At x = A, potential energy U = (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy K is zero because the mass is at rest (momentarily) at the amplitude. So the total energy E is U + K = (1/2)kA².

At x = 0, potential energy U is zero, and the kinetic energy K is maximum. So E = K = gamma m c² - m c²? Wait, no, because in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c², which includes rest energy
