Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y)(ν + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this describes an interaction between the boson X and some fermions. So, the boson X is coupling to fermions here.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, the question is about the possible decay products of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because you need enough energy to produce the rest mass of both the particle and its antiparticle.

So, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I should list the possible fermions that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. Wait, but wait—fermions come in pairs, so each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass.

But wait, actually, the mass of the fermion needs to be less than half of X's mass. So, m_fermion < 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

Electron (e^-): mass about 0.0005 GeV. So way below 3 GeV. They can be produced.

Muon (μ^-): about 0.1 GeV. Also much less than 3 GeV.

Tau (τ^-): about 1.78 GeV. So 1.78 is less than 3, so taus can be decay products.

Then the quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Up quark (u): mass around 2 MeV, negligible, so definitely below 3 GeV.

Down quark (d): similar, like around 3-5 MeV, so also way under.

Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV, so under 3 GeV.

Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV. Still under 3 GeV.

Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 3 GeV. Because 4.1 is bigger than 3. So if X is 6 GeV, 6/2=3. So 4.1 >3, so the bottom quark is too heavy. So X can't decay into b and anti-b because each b is 4.1 GeV, so 2*b is 8.2, which is more than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed.

Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV. So way beyond our limit.

So, the ferm
