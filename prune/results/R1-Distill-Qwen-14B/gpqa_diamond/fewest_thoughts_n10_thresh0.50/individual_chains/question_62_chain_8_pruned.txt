Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Hmm, let's break down the target molecule. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring substituted with two groups: one is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, and the other is a carbaldehyde (CHO) group. Wait, I think I need to visualize the structure. So, maybe it's a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane ring. And the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde? Or maybe adjacent? Wait, the numbering is 1, so the substituents are on the same carbon. So carbon 1 has the cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-OH group, and the aldehyde.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde; the carbonyl is on carbon 1. Then, the other substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group on carbon 1
