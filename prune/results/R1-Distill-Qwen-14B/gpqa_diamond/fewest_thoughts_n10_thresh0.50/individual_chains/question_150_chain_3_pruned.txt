Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 4) and a double bond or ring plus a carbonyl or something.

Looking at the NMR data: 

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â†’ That's a strong deshielded proton. Could be an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The integration is 1H, and it's a triplet. Hmm, why a triplet? Maybe coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, aldehyde is usually a singlet because it's at the end, but maybe the splitting is from something else. Or perhaps it's an enal situation, where the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond, leading to some coupling?

Next, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two sets of doublets, which could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. The upfield shift (6.51) might be due to electron-donating groups, perhaps hydroxyl groups. Wait, para-substituted aromatic protons typically show as a pair of doublets. So maybe there are two para-substituted phenyl groups attached somewhere.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Broad suggests exchange or maybe an -OH group, but it's 2H. Alternatively, maybe vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. Or perhaps it's an enol form
