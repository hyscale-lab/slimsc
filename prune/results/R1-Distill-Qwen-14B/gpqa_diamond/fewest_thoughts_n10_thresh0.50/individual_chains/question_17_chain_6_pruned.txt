Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. 

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the pH is ideal, so I guess that means the solution conditions are such that EDTA is in its active form, like Y^4- maybe. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the concentration calculation here. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. That's a pretty large K, which means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex—so the formula is probably CaY^2- or something like that. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it binds to the metal in a 1:1 ratio. So each Ca^2+ ion is tied up with one EDTA molecule.

I think the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because if the complex is stable, most of the calcium is tied up, so the free [Ca^2+] would be low.

So, I need to find [Ca^2+] when the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and K is 5e10. Let me think about the dissociation equation here.

The complex dissociation would be: CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. But considering the formation, maybe it's better to write it the other way. Wait, no, since we're looking for the free ions, the dissociation is the way to go.

Wait, the formation constant Kf is usually written as [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). But in this case, the K given is probably the formation constant, which is 5e10. So, Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the total EDTA comes from two sources: the free Y^4- and the CaY^2- complex. But wait, no, the question states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is
