Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. The wave function usually is a complex function, but in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5, right?

Wait no, maybe the entire expression is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Wait, no, the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function ψ(x) is a real part and an imaginary part. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5i), but wait, that can't be because the wave function should be a function of x. So I think maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression. Oh, perhaps it's written as a/sqrt(1+x) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Because the way it's written isn't very clear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a real function plus an imaginary constant. Hmm.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for each x, the wave function is a complex number: real part is a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary part is -0.5 (a constant). But that seems a bit odd because usually the wave function's real and imaginary parts depend on x. But here, the imaginary part is a constant, independent of x. That would make the wave function have a real part that varies with x and an imaginary part that's the same everywhere.

Wait, but then when they measure the position, the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, our given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So if this is valid in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), but zero elsewhere. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that when measuring, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So that implies that the wave function is zero outside that interval. So the wave function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3.

But the given wave function expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), making the real part a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part -0.5a/(sqrt(1+x)), but then the imaginary part varies with x. Hmm, but the way it's written is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe it's a/sqrt(1+x) minus 0.5i, so ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i. So the real part depends on x, and the imaginary part is a constant. That would be a bit strange, but okay.

But then, wave functions must satisfy the normalization condition: the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space must equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

So let's proceed. The wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So to find the probability density, we compute |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number A + Bi, the magnitude squared is A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be zero outside the region x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So when we integrate the probability density, it's from x=1 to x=3.

But wait, in the expression given, when x is 0, sqrt(1+0) is 1, but our wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, but within that region, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i.

Wait, but in the expression given, for x=1, 1+x=2, so it's a/sqrt(2) -0.5i. For x=3, it's a/sqrt(4)=a/2 -0.5i. But for x=0, it's a/1 -0.5i, but the wave function should be zero there. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the expression given is for x in [1,3]. So perhaps our wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, that can't be because when x is 1, sqrt(2) is fine, but for x >3, say x=4, 1+x=5, sqrt(5) is fine, but according to the problem statement, the wave function isn't defined beyond x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside [1,3], and in that interval, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

But wait, if the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, then the given wave function must be zero outside that interval. So perhaps the expression is only valid for x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, that would make the wave function ψ(x) a complex function. But for a stationary state, the wave function can be complex, but in this case, perhaps it's a non-stationary state.

But regardless, we can proceed to compute the normalization.

The normalization condition is:

∫ |ψ(x)|² dx from x=-infinity to infinity = 1.

But since ψ(x) is zero outside [1,3], the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =1.

So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2] as I thought earlier.

So the integral is ∫ from 1 to 3 [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx =1.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So at x=3, 1+x=4, ln(4). At x=1, 1+x=2, ln(2). So the integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) = 2 ln(2), so ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Then, the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the normalization equation becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 divided by ln(2). Let me think: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a² ≈ 0.721, so a is sqrt(0.721). Let me compute sqrt(0.721).

Well, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85 because 0.85^2 = 0.7225. So 0.721 is a bit less than that. So sqrt(0.721) is approximately 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistake?

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So |ψ(x)|² is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B², so [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. That's correct.

The integral from 1 to 3 is:

Integral [a²/(1+x) ] dx + integral [0.25] dx.

First integral: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.5.

So a² ln(2) +0.5 =1 → a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²= 0.5/(ln 2). Compute that.

0.5 is 0.5, ln 2 is approximately 0.693147.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈0.7213 → a≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85. So the answer is B.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

This is a complex wave function where the real part depends on \(x\), and the imaginary part is a constant. The particle is only found between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), so the wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition for the wave function is:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since \(\psi(x)\) is zero outside \([1, 3]\), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

We split the integral into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   Using the substitution \(u = 1+x\), \(du = dx\), the integral becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \int_2^4 \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_2^4 = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
