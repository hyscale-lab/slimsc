Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities—Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so same λ_max implies same T.

Wait, but wait again. Do I have to consider Doppler shift? Because Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh right, the observed wavelength would be different due to Doppler effect if the star is moving towards or away from us. But the question says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same. So does that mean that their intrinsic temperatures are the same, or do I have to account for the Doppler shift?

Wait, let's think. If a star is moving towards us, its emitted wavelengths are blueshifted. If moving away, redshifted. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max would be longer than its intrinsic λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So how does that affect their actual temperatures?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the rest frame, so the observed λ_max is the same, meaning their actual λ_max is the same, so T is same. But if Star_
