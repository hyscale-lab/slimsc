Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They want to find the concentration of calcium ions in the solution.

Wait, the stability constant. Oh right, the stability constant (Kf) is a measure of how stable the complex is. A high Kf means the complex doesn't dissociate much. So in this case, since K is 5e10, which is pretty large, the complex should be very stable, meaning not much Ca²+ ions should be free in solution.

The formula for the stability constant should be K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but in solution, EDATA exists in different forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about that. Maybe it's already accounting for the protonation state.

Wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, the complex is formed as Ca(EDTA)_something. Since it's a 1:1 complex, each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4-.

So initially, the solution has 0.02 M of this complex. Assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is large, but we can't ignore it completely. So some Ca²+ will be in solution.

The formula is K = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, what's the concentration of EDTA^4- in solution? Because the complex is made from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So when the complex dissociates, it releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per formula unit.

So if the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, then if x is the concentration of dissociated Ca²+, then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x. Because each dissociated complex gives one of each.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So if it dissociates, the total concentration of the complex plus the dissociated ions should equal 0.02. But since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal, so we can approximate that [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are x, which is small.

So the equation becomes:

K = [CaEDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Plugging in the values:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) 

Wait, because [CaEDTA] is 0.02, and [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, right? Because each dissociation produces one of each.

So 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2)

Solving for x^2:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Let me calculate that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12.

Which is 0.4e-12, so 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13. Taking the square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(e-13) is e^(-6.5). So x is 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6
