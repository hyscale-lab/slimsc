Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction with 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

Hmm, so first, I should probably figure out what kind of reaction is occurring here. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic amine, a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me visualize that structure. The substituent on the pyrrolidine ring is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Wait, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, right? So it's like a cyclohexene connected via a methylene (CH2) group to the pyrrolidine.

So the reaction is forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond. The starting amine (pyrrolidine) is reacting with compound A in the presence of an acid catalyst, probably generating some kind of ring expansion or perhaps a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of addition.

Wait, let me think about the possible reactions. Acid-catalyzed reactions involving amines could involve various mechanisms. One common reaction is the formation of an imine or an enamine. Another possibility is the Beckmann rearrangement, but that usually involves oximes. Or maybe it's an alkylation where the amine acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, looking at the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. That suggests that the pyrrolidine has a new substituent attached. So perhaps the A compound is something that can form that substituent upon reaction with the amine.

Let me look at the options for A and B. The options are either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane as A, and the catalyst is either TsOH or acetic acid.

Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, perhaps with a cyclohexane ring attached to a vinyl group.

So,
