Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a star that's being studied by astronomers. The star has some specific characteristics: a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on temperature. Wait, I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is something like (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, 5500 K, compared to 6000 K. So what does that imply about the ratio n1/n2?

Wait, let me think. The ratio n1/n2 depends on the exponential term. If T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k*T) becomes larger. Because if T is smaller, the denominator is smaller, so the whole exponent is bigger if E2>E1. Wait, but if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k*T) increases. So exp(that) increases. So if (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), because the formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait no, wait: when E2 > E1, particles would prefer the lower energy state, so n2 is less than n1. So the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K), so the ratio is lower than when T is 6000 K. So the ratio when no spots (T=6000 K) is higher than when spots are present (T=5500 K).

Wait, so the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. Because if T is higher, (E2 - E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the exponential is smaller, meaning n1/n2 is lower? Wait, wait, no wait. Let me get this straight. Let me define the ratio R = n1/n2.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, because the denominator is bigger. So the exponential term gets smaller, meaning R decreases because it's multiplied by a smaller value. So when T is higher, R is lower. Wait, but in the problem statement, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio R decreases. So when star has spots, R is lower. Wait, but according to this, when T is lower, R would be higher because the exponential term is bigger. Because the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) would be larger when T is smaller. So exp(large number) is a larger value. So R would be larger when T is lower. But the problem says when the star has spots (T lower), R decreases. That's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio backwards. Oh wait, perhaps the ratio being measured is n2/n1 instead. Because if when T decreases, n2 decreases more than n1, then n2/n1 would be lower.

Wait, let's think again. The Boltzmann equation is n_i = (g_i / Q) * exp( -E_i/(k T) ), where Q is the partition function.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the denominator kT is smaller, so (E2-E1)/(kT) increases. So exp of a larger positive number is bigger. So n1/n2 is bigger when T is lower.

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when T was 6000 K. But according to the equation, the ratio would be higher when T is lower. So that suggests that perhaps the observed ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if when T decreases, n2/n1 would decrease. Let me recalculate.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

E1 < E2, so (E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative. So when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, making the exponent more negative. So exp of a more negative number is smaller. So n2/n1 would be smaller when T is lower. Which matches the observation: when T is lower (with spots), the ratio (n2/n1) is lower.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So according to that, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 increases when T decreases. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are such that E1 > E2? No, because higher energy is level 2. So if E1 is higher than E2, then E2 - E1 is negative. So the exponent would become negative. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the energy levels wrong. Suppose level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. No, that can't be. Because when a star is hotter, more excitation. So when a star is hotter, more atoms are in higher energy levels. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1. So the process is an absorption line. Let me think about the Saha equation and Boltzmann factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is being considered as (n2)/(n1). Let me re-express the problem.

The question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, and when the star has spots, T is lower, and n1/n2 is lower, that would require that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponent bigger, so exp of a bigger number is larger. So n1/n2 would be higher when T is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when T is lower. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, so perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Because if the star's Teff is lower, T decreases, then n2/n1 would decrease. Let's see: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative, so the exponent is negative. So when T decreases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes more negative. So exp of a more negative number is smaller. So n2/n1 decreases. Which matches the observation.

So the ratio that is observed to decrease when the star has spots is n2/n1. Thus, the ratio in the problem is n2/n1. So the question is asking for the factor by which (n1/n2) changes. Because the observed ratio is n2/n1, but the question is about the ratio of the number in two levels as n1/n2.

Wait, let me read the question again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So the ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So according to the earlier analysis, that's only possible if (E2 - E1) is negative. But that can't be because level 2 is higher in energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are such that level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2. Then, (E2 - E1) is negative. So (E2 - E1)/(k T) is negative. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative. So exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) is exp(negative number), and as T decreases, the exponent is more negative, so the value of the exponential becomes smaller. So n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). If (E2 - E1) is negative, then exp( (negative) ) is a small number. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the observation.

So I think the correct setup is that E1 > E2. So level 1 is higher energy than level 2. That makes sense because the observed ratio is n1/n2, which goes down when T goes down.

So the next step is to compute the ratio R = (n1/n2) at 6000 K divided by (n1/n2) at 5500 K. Because the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The formula for R is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But since E1 > E2, E2 - E1 is negative. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, the factor is [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Simplify: the g1/g2 terms cancel out. So the factor is exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because when you take the ratio, it's [ exp(a) ] / [ exp(b) ] = exp(a - b). So:

= exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) ) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] )

Wait, yes, because:

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )
R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )
Factor = R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) - (E2 - E1)/(k T2) ) )

Factor = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Now, we can compute this exponent. But wait, what is (E2 - E1)? Since E2 < E1, (E2 - E1) is negative. So the exponent is negative times (1/T1 - 1/T2). Let me compute (1/T1 - 1/T2).

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667
1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 ≈ 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515 K^-1.

Multiply by (E2 - E1)/(k), which is negative (since E2 < E1). So (E2-E1) is negative, so (E2-E1)/k is negative. So:

(E2-E1)/k * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (negative) * (negative) = positive.

So the exponent is positive, so exp of a positive number is greater than 1. So the factor is greater than 1.

But to compute the exact value, we need to find (E2 - E1), but we don't have that directly. However, the transition is given: the transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 is the photon energy corresponding to this wavelength. So E2 - E1 = h c / lambda.

Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, lambda is the wavelength.

So compute E2 - E1 = h c / lambda.

But since E2 < E1, E2 - E1 is negative. Wait no, wait, since the transition is from higher to lower energy, the photon emitted has energy E1 - E2. So the energy difference E1 - E2 = h c / lambda.

Alternatively, since E2 < E1, E2 - E1 is negative. So E2 - E1 = - (E1 - E2) = - (h c / lambda )

So now, let me compute the value:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So E1 - E2 = h c / lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Denominator: 1.448e-7 m

So E1 - E2 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

But to make calculations easier, perhaps compute in terms of eV, since Boltzmann's constant is often expressed in eV/K.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E1 - E2 = 1.373e-18 J = (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Wait, 1448 Å is in the infrared, so the energy should be lower than visible. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, 1448 Å is 0.1448 micrometers. Wait, wait, no: 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 1448 Å is 144.8 nm? No, 1 Å is 0.1 nm, so 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. Which is in the UV range, not infrared. Hmm, I thought 1400 Å was near-UV. Wait, so the energy difference would be higher.

Wait, let me recalculate E1 - E2.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
lambda = 1448e-10 m
E = h c / lambda = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 = approx 1.373 * 1e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Because 10 eV photons are in the X-ray range. 1448 Å is in the near-UV, which should correspond to a few eV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So 1.373e-18 J.

In eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's correct. So the energy difference is about 8.57 eV. That's a big value. But perhaps that's correct. So E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV.

So (E2 - E1) = -8.57 eV.

But we need to use E2 - E1 in the Boltzmann equation, so it's negative.

Now, plug into the exponent:

(E2 - E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

k is Boltzmann's constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So:

(E2-E1) = -8.57 eV.

So,

(E2-E1)/(k) = (-8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) ≈ (-8.57) / (8.617e-5) ) K.

Calculating that: 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99400 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ -99400 K.

Now, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.

Wait, let me compute that:

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151 K^-1.

So,

(E2 - E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (-99400 K) * (-0.000015151 K^-1 ) 

= 99400 * 0.000015151 

Let me compute that:

99400 * 0.000015151 = 99400 * 1.5151e-5

99400 = 9.94e4

So 9.94e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.94 * 1.5151) * 1e-1 

9.94 * 1.5151 ≈ 15.05 (because 10 *1.515=15.15, so 9.94 is a bit less, say 15.05 )

So 15.05 * 0.1 = 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor is exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

We know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953.

But 1.505 is just a bit above 1.5.

Let me compute e^1.505.

We can approximate using Taylor series or a calculator.

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute e^1.505.

We can write 1.505 = 1.5 + 0.005.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.005 ≈ 1 + 0.005 + (0.005)^2/2 + (0.005)^3/6 ≈ 1.0050125.

So e^1.505 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.005 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0050125 ≈ 4.4817 *1.005 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.005 = 4.4817 + 0.0224085 ≈ 4.504.

So the factor is approximately 4.504. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (n₁/n₂) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

### Key Observations:
1. The ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the effective temperature \( T \) decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K).
2. The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) corresponds to the photon energy emitted during the transition, which is related to the wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as \( E_1 - E_2 = 8.57 \, \text{eV} \), so \( E_2 - E_1 = -8.57 \, \text{eV} \).

### Factor Calculation:
The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000 \, \text{K}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500 \, \text{K}}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right)
\]

### Substituting Values:
- \( E_2 - E_1 = -8.57 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \)
- \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00016667, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.00018182
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Now, calculate \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{-8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx -99400 \, \text{K}
\]

Finally, compute the exponent:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = (-99400)(-0.00001515) \approx 1.505
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.504
\]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) changes is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option **C**.
