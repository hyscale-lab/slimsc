Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm.

I remember that parallax and distance are related. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases and vice versa.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we need to relate N to distance r (which I think is the same as d here). Let me think.

So since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 over that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, so N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. So they're probably asking for the differential, like the number of stars per unit distance interval. Hmm, because just saying it changes with distance as r^5 would imply that for each r, the number is proportional to r^5, but the options don't have r^5 as the first option. Wait the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2. Oh wait, option B is r^5. So if the number of stars N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a region at distance r would be proportional to r^5. But wait, wait a second. That might not be the case if the question is about the number per unit distance.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: The question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? So maybe they're asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Like, how many stars are there per parsec, for example.

So let's think of it this way. Suppose N is the number of stars in a small range of distance dr around some distance r. Then N = (dN/dr) * dr. So dN/dr is the number per unit distance.

We have N ∝ 1/plx^5. But plx = 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, that would be the number within a certain range. Or wait, maybe not.

Wait, let me get this straight. If the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But that would mean that the number of stars in that region increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that doesn't make much sense intuitively. Because as you look further away, the density of stars you observe should decrease, right? Because stars are spread out more. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's think about it again. The number of stars observed in a region depends on how many are present at that distance. But when you observe, the number you can see depends on their distance. So the number of stars with a certain apparent brightness (or in a certain region) depends on their distance.

But the data given is that the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, 1/plx = r. So 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. So for a larger distance, more stars? That seems a bit odd because I thought that as you go further, you would see fewer stars. Or perhaps the opposite is true? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a given region per unit distance. So for each unit of distance, how many stars are there? So let's model this.

Suppose that the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. But in reality, the number density of stars in the galaxy isn't uniform, but let's assume for this problem that it's uniform for simplicity.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should approach it mathematically.

Let me denote the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr as dN. The volume of this shell is 4πr² dr. If the number density is n (number per unit volume), then dN = n * 4π r² dr.

But in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, that's a bit different. So perhaps in this region, the number of stars at a distance r is N(r) = k / (plx)^5, where k is a proportionality constant.

Plx = 1/r, so N(r) = k r^5.

But then, the number of stars in a thin shell at r is dN = (dN/dr) dr. Because for a thin shell, the number would be the derivative of N with respect to r multiplied by dr.

Wait, but N(r) is the cumulative number of stars up to distance r, or is it the number per unit volume? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N = constant / plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = constant * r^5.

So if N is the number of stars within a certain region, maybe a unit area on the sky, then for each r, the number of stars at distance r is proportional to r^5.

Wait, that would imply that as you look further away, the number of stars you count increases as r^5, which is a rapid increase. But that seems counterintuitive because stars are spread out more at larger distances. Unless the actual number density of stars increases with distance, but that's not usually the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the volume increases with distance, so when you look further away, the volume you're considering is larger, so even if the number density is constant, the total number increases with r^3 (since volume is ~r^3). So if the number of stars is proportional to r^5, that would mean the number density is increasing as r^2. Because N = n * Volume, so N = n * (4/3) π r^3. So if N ∝ r^5, then n ∝ r^2. So number density would increase with the square of the distance, which is not typical. But perhaps in this problem, that's the case.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think in terms of the mathematical relationships.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, so N = k * r^5.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes "per unit range of distance". So imagine you pick a small range of distance dr around some r. The number of stars in that range would be dN = (dN/dr) dr.

So dN/dr is the rate of change of N with respect to r. Since N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So dN/dr ∝ r^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit distance range increases as r^4. So the number of stars in a unit distance interval (like per parsec) increases with r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me verify.

The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. So for a given area of the sky, the number of stars you observe is proportional to r^5.

But if you consider the number per unit distance interval, you take the derivative of N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5 * (1/plx^5) * (d plx / dr). Wait, plx = 1/r, so d plx/dr = -1/r².

So substituting: dN/dr = 5 * (1/( (1/r)^5 )) * (-1/r²) ) [Wait, no, because N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So N = k r^5, where k is a constant.

Then dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer is option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when you're dealing with fluxes or other quantities, you have to consider other factors like the brightness. But in this question, it's about the number of stars, so I think the approach is correct.

So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4, which is option C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is related to distance (\( r \)) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes "per unit range of distance." To find this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Starting with \( N \propto r^5 \), taking the derivative gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance interval (\( \frac{dN}{dr} \)) is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
