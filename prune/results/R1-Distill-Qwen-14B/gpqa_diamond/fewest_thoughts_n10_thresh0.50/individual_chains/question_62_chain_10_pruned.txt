Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw it out mentally. So, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to another cyclohexane, but wait, the substituents are on the same carbon. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the name again. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, the structure is:

The central carbon is attached to:
- A cyclohexyl group (from the cyclohexane ring)
- A hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH)
- And the aldehyde group (CHO)

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and on carbon 1 (which is adjacent to the connecting point), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, noâ€”actually, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where the substit
