Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration and pH calculations can be tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, first, the initial step is to dilute the acetic acid. Let me think, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

Wait, so the initial concentration is 0.05 M. Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2. So, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so when diluted, it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the initial setup, maybe we just need to know the concentration after dilution.

Next, the titration. We're adding NaOH, which is a strong base, to the acetic acid. The reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. The concentration is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of
