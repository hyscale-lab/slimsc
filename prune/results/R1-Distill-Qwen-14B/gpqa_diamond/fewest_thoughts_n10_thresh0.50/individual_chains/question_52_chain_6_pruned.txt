Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Let's parse the details.

First, the star's normal Teff (effective temperature) is 6000 K when it's not covered by spots. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, does that make sense? Because dark spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the star, the overall brightness (and thus effective temperature) would decrease. So the Teff would be lower when spots are present. That aligns with the given numbers.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is level 1 to level 2, I suppose. And when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star is spot-free, the ratio is higher, and when it has spots, it's lower.

Wait, why would that happen? Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation governs the population of different energy levels in a star's atmosphere under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The ratio of populations depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) )

Here, n_i and n_j are the number of atoms in energy levels i and j. g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. The exponent depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. So the T in the exponent would be lower. Let's think about how that affects the ratio.

But wait, I thought the spots would make parts of the star cooler. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted. Does that mean the entire photosphere's average temperature is now 5500 K? Or is the photosphere only the unspotted regions, and the spots are cooler? Hmm
