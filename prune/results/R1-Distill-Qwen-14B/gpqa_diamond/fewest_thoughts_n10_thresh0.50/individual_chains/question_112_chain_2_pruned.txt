Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: There's an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix Aij has elements where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. So, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's denote |up> as |↑> and |down> as |↓> for simplicity.

So, |alpha> = (1+i)|↑> + (2 - i)|↓>. To find the probabilities, I should first normalize it.

The normalization process involves calculating the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then dividing by its magnitude. The norm squared is [ (1+i)(1-i) ) + (2-i)(2+i) ] because when you take the inner product, the cross terms (like |↑><↓| and vice versa) will involve the off-diagonal elements but since it's the square of the magnitude, those cross terms would cancel out (because they're complex conjugates multiplied together, which gives real numbers).

Wait, no, actually, the square of the magnitude (the norm) is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. Oh wait, no, because each term is a complex number. So for a state |a> = a|↑> + b|↓>, the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 Re(a*b† + b*a†) ? No, wait, no. Wait, when you take |a|^2, it's (a)(a*) for each component. So for |↑> and |↓>, the basis is orthonormal, meaning <↑|↑> = 1, <↑|↓
