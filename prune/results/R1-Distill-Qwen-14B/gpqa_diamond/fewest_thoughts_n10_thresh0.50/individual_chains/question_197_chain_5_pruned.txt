Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X. Let me break down the information given.

First, the IR data. IR is used to identify functional groups. The peaks given are 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, the broadness might suggest an O-H group. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) group. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or acid?

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR has several signals. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes usually are around 9-10. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which can be around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad because of hydrogen bonding. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid group.

Then there's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets each integrating to 2H suggest substitution at the para position. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

The rest of the NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These seem like alkyl chain protons. Let me think about the splitting. The 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H could be a methylene adjacent to something. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for two Hs—maybe a -CH2- group next to another CH. The 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits into a doublet. Like a CH(CH3)
