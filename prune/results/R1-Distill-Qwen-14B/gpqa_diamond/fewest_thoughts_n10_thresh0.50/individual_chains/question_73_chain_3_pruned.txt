Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from school that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of relativity. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed part.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. Wait, wait. Wait a second, are both moving in the same direction? Because if they were moving towards each other, the relative speed would be different. Oh, the question says both are in the positive x-direction, so they're moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but not just subtracting them normally because of relativity.

Wait, but in relativity, the way you add velocities isn't the same as classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, actually, since they're moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed is (u - v) but adjusted with the Lorentz factor. So the formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, the velocity addition formula when two objects are moving in the same direction. So if astronaut
