Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. But these operators must respect certain symmetries. Right, because if they didn't, the theory might not make sense or might not agree with observations.

So, let's break down each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. In the Standard Model, all interactions are Lorentz invariant. SMEFT is an effective theory, so I think its operators must also be Lorentz scalars. So they must transform in a way that the terms are Lorentz-invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So symmetry 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry? Because the SMEFT is a field theory, it's formulated in a spacetime with Poincare symmetry. So the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, wait! SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's formulated in a flat spacetime, which is Poincare invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry
