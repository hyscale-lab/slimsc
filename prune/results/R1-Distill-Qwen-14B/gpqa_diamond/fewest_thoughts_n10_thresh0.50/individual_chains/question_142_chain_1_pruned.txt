Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But wait, this one looks like it's a mixture of |0> and |1>.

So, first, I need to figure out if this state is a pure state or a mixed state. A pure state would be a single ket, like |ψ><ψ|, but here it's (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. That tells me it's a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of two states. Each state is equally probable since the coefficients are 1/2 each.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere, right? Oh wait, for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. But this is a density matrix, which for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) with |r| ≤ 1. So, if I can rewrite the given ρ into this form, I can find the r vector.

Let me compute each term. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me expand this. 

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). Adding them gives a diagonal matrix [1, 0; 0, 1], which is the identity matrix. So when I multiply by 1/2, the matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait a second, that's the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. Because the identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], so half of that is diag(0.5, 0.
