Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some scientific notations. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor multiplied by the velocity. Oh wait, yeah, the mean proper lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ via the uncertainty principle. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I think the formula is τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), right?

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Then the mean lifetime is τ, but the mean path length is cτ multiplied by the velocity β. Because the actual lifetime experienced in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Hmm, wait no, time dilation comes into play when the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. So the lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime τ. 

So the mean decay distance L is c multiplied by gamma (γ) times β (v/c) times τ. Oh, right, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta squared), and beta is v/c. So L = c * beta * gamma * tau. But
