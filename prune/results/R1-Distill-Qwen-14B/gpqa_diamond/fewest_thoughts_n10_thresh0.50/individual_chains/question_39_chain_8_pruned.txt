Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So I guess the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Or wait, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3 because the question says none were found outside. 

Wait, no. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but only in a part of space where it can exist. Oh, but the measurement shows that the particles are found only between 1 and 3, so maybe the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Or perhaps the wave function is zero beyond that because it's a bound state or something. 

Wait, but the wave function provided is given for a part where the particle exists, and in that part, the function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, but wait, the wave function shouldn't necessarily be zero outside, but the probabilities are zero there. Oh, but the question says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function must be zero outside this interval. So perhaps the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and non
