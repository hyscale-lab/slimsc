Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that decay distance has something to do with the lifetime of the particle. The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula I think is L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But how do I get tau from the given width? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle tells us that Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, units are tricky here. Let's make sure. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me recall: ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So when Γ is in GeV, tau would be in seconds.

Wait, here Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ /
