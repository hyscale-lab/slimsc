Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the theory of relativity, specifically the energy-momentum relation. The formula for the total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but what's the mass of the nucleus here? The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. Oh, right, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. So the mass I should use is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

The mass number A is 6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons). The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, but I should get the exact value. Wait, no, wait—wait, the mass isn't just 6u because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less due to binding energy. But for heavy ions like this, maybe the problem just wants to use the rest mass based on the sum of protons and neutrons? Or perhaps it's given as the mass of the nucleus itself, so maybe I can take it
