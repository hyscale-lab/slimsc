Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. From what I gather, Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. The molecules where protons and neutrons are equal would be something like hydrogen isotopes. Oh wait, no, hydrogen only has one proton. Let me think: another possibility is something like carbon-12, but wait, I'm getting mixed up. Oh wait, I think the gas W is D2, deuterium gas. Because deuterium has one proton and one neutron, so they are equal. Or maybe it's another gas, but let me think more.

So when X reacts with Y, it forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is close to 277 K. Wait, what's the melting point of something around 277 K? Let me calculate that. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, since 273 K is 0°C. So melting at around 4°C. What solid melts near that temperature? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Hmm, maybe some other substance. Wait, melting at 277 K is about 4°C. Not sure yet.

The next part says that the
