Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? Take the speed of light in a vacuum c=1.

Hmm, the options are A to D. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that the speed of light in a medium like glass is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, in the glass at rest, the light's speed would be v_light = c/n. Since c is given as 1, that's v_light = 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. Oh right, so we're dealing with relative motion here. The observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, same direction as the light beam. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too.

Wait, but the beam is in the glass. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n relative to the glass.

So
