Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, since the photospheres are in LTE, that means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So I should probably use the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), right? Where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote E2 - E1 as delta E, assuming E2 is higher than E1. Wait, but I'm not sure which is which. Oh, wait, the problem says that star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the excitation here refers to higher energy state. So perhaps star_1 has more atoms in the excited state.

Wait, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So let me denote n1 as the number in star_1, and n2 as in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Using the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = exp( -(delta E)/(k*T) )

Wait, wait. Wait, if E is the energy of the level, and say the energy difference is E_high - E_low = delta E. Then the ratio would be (n_high)/(n_low) = exp( -delta E/(k*T) )

So if the higher energy level is more populated in star_1, maybe that's the case. But wait, the statement is that the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps they're in a higher state.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. But I'm not sure about the exact setup.

Wait, since star_1 has twice as many excited as star_2, let's model it. Let's say that for a particular transition, the excited state is E2 and the lower state is E1. So for each star, the ratio of E2 to E1 would depend on their temperature.

But the problem says that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. So that's E2 - E1 = delta E.

So for star 1, the ratio n1 (excited) / n2 (ground state) would be proportional to exp( -delta E/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star 2, the ratio would be exp( -delta E/(k*T2) )

Wait, but wait. The number ratio of the excited state to the ground state is n_e / n_g.

But in star_1, n_e1 = 2 * n_e2.

Wait, no, the problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n_e1 = 2 * n_e2.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused about which n is which. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps for each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the ground state is the same. No, wait, that's not right. Each star has its own temperature, so the ratios are different.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps n_e1 = 2 * n_e2, where n_e1 is the number in the excited state for star 1, and n_e2 for star 2.

But wait, no. The ratio would also depend on the total number of atoms. Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the number of atoms in the two levels is proportional to the populations. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is (n_e)/(n_g) = exp(-delta E/(k T)).

So for star 1, (n_e1)/(n_g1) = exp( -delta E/(k T1) )

For star 2, (n_e2)/(n_g2) = exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem states that n_e1 = 2 * n_e2. Wait, no, it says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps n_e1 = 2 * n_e2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the excitation is relative to the ground state, so the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the ratio (n_e / n_g) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, that's probably the correct approach. So (n_e1 / n_g1) = 2 * (n_e2 / n_g2 )

But each of these ratios is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So:

(n_e1)/(n_g1) = exp( -delta E/(k T1) )

(n_e2)/(n_g2) = exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

So taking the ratio of these two:

(n_e1/n_g1) / (n_e2/n_g2) ) = exp( [delta E/(k)] (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Because:

exp(-delta E/(k T1)) / exp(-delta E/(k T2)) ) = exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that division:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So a is -delta E/(k T1), and b is -delta E/(k T2).

So a - b = [ -delta E/(k T1) ) + delta E/(k T2) ) ] = delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So that ratio is exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But from the problem statement, (n_e1/n_g1)/(n_e2/n_g2) ) = [ (n_e1/n_g1) ] / [ (n_e2/n_g2) ) ] = 2.

Wait, because (n_e1/n_g1) = 2 * (n_e2/n_g2 ), so the ratio is 2.

So, 2 = exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (delta E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, so delta E is positive, and (1/T2 -1/T1) is the term.

But let's think about what that implies. Let me rearrange the equation.

ln(2) = (delta E / k) (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Or,

ln(2) = (delta E / k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (delta E / k ) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, but wait, the problem gives the energy difference as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38e-23 is close to k (Boltzmann's constant) which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So delta E = k * T_something? Wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K).

So delta E = k * (some temperature difference term?)

Wait, but delta E is a fixed value given, so 1.38e-23 J equals k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So delta E = k.

So, substituting delta E = k.

So,

ln(2) = (k / k ) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Simplify k/k to 1.

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, which is the same as ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Because (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let's compute (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (1/T2) - (T1)/(T1 T2) ) = 1/T2 - 1/T1.

Yes, so:

ln(2) = (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's what we have.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1 ]

No, that would be if delta E/(k) was ln(2), but that's not the case here.

B) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) ]

Hmm, that's (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (1/T2 + 1/T1 ), which isn't what we have.

C) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]

No, because denominator would be squared, which we don't have.

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we derived.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), the Boltzmann distribution is applied.

The Boltzmann distribution states:

\[
\frac{n_e}{n_g} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_e \) and \( n_g \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the states, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{e1}}{n_{g1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{e2}}{n_{g2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{e1}}{n_{g1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{e2}}{n_{g2}}.
\]

Dividing the two equations:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{e1}}{n_{g1}}}{\frac{n_{e2}}{n_{g2}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{n_{e1}}{n_{g1}} / \frac{n_{e2}}{n_{g2}} = 2 \):

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \) (given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches Boltzmann's constant), this simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived equation:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived relationship.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) introduces an incorrect addition of temperatures.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
