Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass, v_max, in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Wait, I remember that in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is the relativistic case, so I guess special relativity comes into play here. Relativistic effects would modify the equations of motion, right?

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. So, using conservation of energy: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things are more complicated.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy conservation equation would involve relativistic terms.

The total energy in a relativistic oscillator would then be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, I think. So the energy E is γmc². But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is
