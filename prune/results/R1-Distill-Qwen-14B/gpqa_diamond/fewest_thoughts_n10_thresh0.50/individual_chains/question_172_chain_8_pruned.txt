Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that in stars, the distribution of excited atoms relates to the temperature because of the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution deals with the population of particles in different energy states. The formula I recall is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call this delta E, so Î”E = E_i - E_j. For star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, the population ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. Wait, no. Wait, when the excitation is higher, the ratio is higher. So in star_1, the ratio n_high / n_low is higher than in star_2.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, for a specific energy level, the number of excited atoms is twice as much as in star_2. So, for each star, the ratio of atoms in that excited state to the lower state would be different.

Let me think: For star_1, n_high / n_low = 2. For star_2, n_high / n_low = 1 (since star_1 is twice as excited; so star_2's is half that, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the question says the excitation is twice as much, so maybe the ratio is 2:1. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2 it's 1. But wait, that might not be correct. Let me read the question again.

It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms. So,
