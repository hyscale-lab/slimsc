Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed part.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when we talk about relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction, I think I subtract their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, in relativity, the addition isn't that straightforward. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects as seen from the rest frame. But wait, in this problem, both are moving in the same direction. So let me get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, actually, the relative speed would be how fast one is moving relative to the other. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think I should take the higher speed minus the lower speed, but corrected by the relativistic formula.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the order. Let's think. If object X is moving at speed u relative to the rest frame, and object Y is moving at speed v in the same direction, then from X's frame, Y's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Oh wait, no, that can't be right. Because when u is the speed of the moving frame relative to the rest, then the object's speed in that frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So if u is the speed of the observer's frame, then to find the relative speed of another object moving at v (same direction), we use that formula.

So here, let's say astronaut A is the one moving at 0.6c. So from A's perspective, astronaut B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that numerator first: 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving slower than A in the same direction. But since speed is a magnitude, the relative speed is 0.1428c.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts, regardless of direction. So the magnitude would be about 0.14c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? I think the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for each astronaut, I'll calculate their individual energies and sum them.

First astronaut (2m) has v = 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m) has v = 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 *3m c² = 1.1547 *3 m c² = around 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So that matches. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower, so that's probably incorrect.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the energy calculation.

First astronaut: v=0.6c, mass=2m.

Gamma1: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25.

E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c, mass=3m.

Gamma2: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.154700538.

E2 = 3m * gamma2 * c² = 3 * 1.154700538 * m c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 = 3.4641 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Summing E1 and E2: 2.5 +3.464 = 5.964 ≈5.96 mc². So that's option C.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14 c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. Since the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, relativistic formulas must be used.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic formula for the relative speed \( u' \) between two objects moving in the same direction is:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A is moving at \( u = 0.6c \), and astronaut B is moving at \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates that astronaut B is moving slower than astronaut A in the same direction. The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Mass \( m_A = 2m \), speed \( v_A = 0.6c \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Mass \( m_B = 3m \), speed \( v_B = 0.5c \):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
