Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure if I need to look into that closely. Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think the important part here is that the boson X interacts with fermions, right?

So, the problem is about which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into. The options are combinations of different fermions. The key here is to determine, based on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions, which decays are possible.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. I remember that for a particle to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the fermion must be less than half of the boson's mass. Because the total energy available must be at least twice the fermion mass (since each fermion in the pair must have at least that mass).

So, the formula would be m_X ≥ 2 m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion. So, m_f ≤ m_X / 2. Since m_X is 6 GeV, m_f needs to be ≤ 3 GeV.

So now I need to list all the fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

From what I remember:
- Electron (e): very light, mass ≈ 0.0005 GeV. So definitely allowed.
- Muon (μ): mass about 0.1 GeV. Also allowed.
- Tau (τ): much heavier, around 1.78 GeV. So 2 * 1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, wait, so tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So, 1.78 is less than 3 GeV, so tau can be produced. Wait, because 2 * 1.78 is 3.56, which exceeds 3 GeV? Oh wait, no, the condition is m_f ≤ m_X / 2. So m_f = 1.78 GeV is less than 3 GeV, so yes, tau can be produced. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the tau mass. I think the tau is about 1.78 GeV, yeah. So 2 * 1.78 is 3.56, which is more than 3 GeV. Oh, so that would mean that the tau pair can't be produced. Because X is 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV per particle. So 3 GeV is the maximum allowed for each fermion. So if a fermion has a mass higher than 3 GeV, that
