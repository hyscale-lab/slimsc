Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the question says that two stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the first fact I remember is that the RV method measures the star's wobble velocity. The bigger the planet, the higher the velocity shift. The formula I think is something like v = (G*M_planet / (M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) * ... wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law here. Because Kepler's law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis (which is the same as radius for circular orbits) to the mass.

Wait, wait. Kepler's third law in the context of exoplanets is often written as P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a^3. But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So P^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) * a^3. 

But how does this relate to the RV method? Oh right, the RV method measures the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The maximum velocity (v_max) is given by v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet))^(2/3) * (1 / P)^(1/3). Hmm, but maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude (K) in the RV method is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) or something like that. Wait, let me get the formula right. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P * (1 day))^(-1/3) ) ]^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach. Since the problem is about the ratio of the orbital periods, perhaps I can relate
