Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to use the provided FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data to determine which one is correct.

First, let's break down the given information.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching, such as in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be an -OH group, maybe in a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, right, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But another possibility: if it were an aldehyde, the peak would be a bit higher, like around 2800-2700 cm⁻¹. But the broad peak at 3000 might suggest something else.

Additionally, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 is a typical region for a ketone or aldehyde, maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something like an aromatic ring with conjugation, maybe an aromatic ketone? Or perhaps an amide? Wait, but the options don't include nitrogen, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, ester, or acid.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, possibly conjugated with a carbonyl group, which would explain the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Like an enone (conjugated ketone) or something similar.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at
