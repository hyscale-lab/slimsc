Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So maybe it's describing some kind of surface in 2D.

I remember that the area of a sphere in general relativity can be found using the metric. For a standard sphere, the metric in polar coordinates is something like ds² = (r² + a²) dθ² + (r² dr²)/(r² - a²), but wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, maybe this metric is already given in a suitable form to compute the area.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in 2D, the line element is expressed in terms of x and y. The area element in 2D for a metric ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in this case, since it's diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy = same thing because the other
