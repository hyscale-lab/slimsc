Okay, I'm trying to solve this Michael addition problem. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is a 1,4-addition. The nucleophile, like an enolate, adds to the β position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Looking at the first reaction (A): dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. The other component, the methyl (E) acrylate, has an α,β-unsaturated ester. So, the malonate's enolate will attack the β position of the acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, right? Since it's E, the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. But for the Michael addition, the geometry might not matter as much as the reactivity.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β carbon (the CH2 part), it adds across the double bond. So, the malonate's -OCH2COOCH3 would attach to the CH2, and the other end would connect to the p-tolyl group.

Wait, actually, let me draw this out mentally. The acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. The nucleophilic enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOCH3)2-) will attack the β carbon (the CH2 part) of the acrylate. So after addition, the product would have the malonate's part attached to the CH2, and the p-tolyl group as the other substituent.

So the structure would become CH2(COOCH3)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me
