Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me think through what I know.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through fusion. The pp-III branch is a specific part of this chain, right? So if that suddenly stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux reaching Earth?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos, and their production depends on the reactions happening in the Sun's core. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the earlier branches, I think.

So if pp-III stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would drop. But the question is about the ratio of two neutrino bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Let's think about the typical energies involved.

I recall that the dominant neutrinos from the Sun in the lower energy range (like around 100s of keV) come from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which produce more of the lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch, on the other hand, contributes to higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands should drop more than the lower ones.

But wait, the question is specifically about the ratio of flux between band 1 (
