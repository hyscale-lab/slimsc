Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct form for complexing, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

The options are A to D, with various concentrations. The correct answer is one of these. Hmm. Right, so I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong that complex is.

Wait, so the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think about the dissociation of this complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The reaction would be something like Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[Ca-EDTA]. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Because Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the higher the Kf, the more the complex is formed.

So if Kf is large, like 5e10, that means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low. 

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Let me call the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. 

So according to the Kf expression:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10.

We know [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. So substituting:

5e10 = (0.02)
