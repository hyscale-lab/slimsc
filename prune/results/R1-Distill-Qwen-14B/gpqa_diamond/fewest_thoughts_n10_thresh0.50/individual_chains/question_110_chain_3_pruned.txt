Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key point is the apparent magnitude V that each spectrograph can observe.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (so V ≤17). HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (so V ≤16). So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by both. Because if it's brighter than 16 (like 15), it's within both's limits. But wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh right, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So 'brighter than 17' means mag ≤17, because magnitude 17 is fainter than 16, for example. Because magnitude scales are inverted; the lower the number, the brighter the star.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, I think that's a typo. Because in reality, higher magnitude means fainter. So "brighter than 17" means apparent mag less than or equal to 17. Because a star with V=10 is brighter than V=20.

Wait, no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning m_v <17, then it's detectable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is m_v <16.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought. So the limit for ESPRESSO is m_v <17, and for HIRES it's m_v <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have m_v less than 16. Because that's the more restrictive condition. Because if it's less than 16, it's also less than 17. So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16.

So I need to find which of the stars have apparent V magnitudes ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star's data.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So apparent magnitude can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + extinction (if any). But wait, does Star1 have extinction? Let me check.

Star1's data: absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. No mention of E(B-V), so I'll assume no extinction. So m_v = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 5*0 =15.5. So m_v=15.5. Which is less than 16, so it's detectable by
