Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? I remember that for stars, luminosity is more related to their radius and temperature, not directly their mass, though mass does influence things like size and temperature. But in this problem, they say to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe I can use the black body radiation formula.

The problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest to be the same. Oh right, the wavelength at which a black body emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, approximately 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but that's not possible for real stars, but the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So let's go with that. Both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, so L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

In this case, T is the same for both stars, so L is proportional to R squared. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Let's compute the luminosity ratio.

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) → since T1 = T2, this is (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Wait, but wait, the problem says "calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of." So 2.25 is the factor. So the answer should be A) 2.25. But wait, what's the exact calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed luminosity?

Oh, wait, because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. If the star is moving towards us, the wavelengths of the emitted light get shorter (blue shifted), and if moving away, longer (red shifted). But earlier we thought both stars have the same λ_max because their observed brightness peaks are same. Hmm, but if their actual temperatures are same,
