Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one is the correct product.

Hmm, the first step is to analyze the IR and NMR data to determine what compound X is. Let's start with the IR. The IR data shows strong absorption around 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either alcohols or maybe amines, or maybe something with an -OH group. But looking further down, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so that suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait: the 1720 cm-1 is a bit lower than a typical aldehyde (which is higher, around 2800 for the C-H stretch, but the C=O is higher, maybe 1710-1740). Alternatively, a ketone is around 1715, right? Or maybe esters are around 1740-1760. Wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but they usually have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1. The IR here shows 3400-2500, which could be O-H or perhaps an alkene C-H stretch (but that's usually around 3000-3100). Wait, but if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, like a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a broad peak for O-H around 2500-3300, which it does. But wait, another possibility is an acid derivative, but let's not jump the gun.

Wait, in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester or a ketone. Let's look at the NMR data to get more clues.

The 1H NMR data is as follows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a singlet around 10.5, which often corresponds to an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H signal, but that's usually a singlet around 10-12 ppm. Wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a -COOH proton? But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 10.5. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but let's think about the other peaks. There's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical of a para-sub
