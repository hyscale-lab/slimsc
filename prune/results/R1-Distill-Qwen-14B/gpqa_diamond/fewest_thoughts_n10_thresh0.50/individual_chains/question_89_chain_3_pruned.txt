Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by breaking down the question and each reaction.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. From what I remember, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. The 1,3-dibromo part means there are two bromine atoms attached to adjacent bridgehead carbons.

The first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think this might be an elimination reaction or perhaps a substitution. But since it's dibromo and KOH is in excess, elimination (E2) is more likely. The product is a light yellow solid, which probably is an alkene. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a carbonyl group (C=O). Hmm, but elimination would form a double bond, right? Oh wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Or maybe it's a ketone? Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But if it's 1,3-dibromo, not vicinal. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on bridgehead carbons that are not adjacent. Because in adamantane, the bridgeheads are diagonally opposite. So perhaps the KOH isn't causing elimination but something else. Wait, maybe it's an elimination to form an allene? Or maybe it's a substitution. Wait, another possibility: when two adjacent bridgehead bromines are present, heating with a strong base might cause them to eliminate two equivalents of HBr and form an allene. But adamantane's structure is quite rigid. Or perhaps, with such a structure, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to the elimination of two HBr molecules and the formation of a double bond. But wait, if two Brs are on carbons that are adjacent, elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but 1,3 in adamantane, are those carb
