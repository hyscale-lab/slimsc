Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we're supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. So the first part is about finding probabilities, and the second part is about the expectation value. Let's tackle each part.

Starting with the state |alpha>. The state is given as proportional, so I think I need to normalize it first. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To find the probabilities, I'll probably need the normalized state, so I should compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Because the states |up> and |down> are orthonormal. 

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) is 1 +1 =2.

|2 -i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state would be [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] |down>.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so the actual state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we need to normalize it. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

But wait, the problem refers to eigenstates of another operator, not the z-projection. That operator's matrix is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The operator has elements: A11=0, A12= hbar/2, A21=hbar/2, A22=0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0  ]

Wait a second, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes. So the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Let's find them.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/
