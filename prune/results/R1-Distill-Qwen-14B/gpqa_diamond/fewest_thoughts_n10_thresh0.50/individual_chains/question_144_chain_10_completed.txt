Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, this is about their decay. I think the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Oh wait, the width is the decay width, I suppose. So I need to find the mean decay length or something like that.

Wait, how do I approach this? I remember something about particle decay and lifetimes. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the decay width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Because Γ is the decay width, which is the total width. So when you have a particle, the width relates to its lifetime—wider the width, shorter the lifetime.

But how does that relate to the decay distance? Oh right! The mean decay distance (or mean path length) is the product of the particle's velocity and its mean lifetime. So L = v * τ.

Wait, but wait, how do I find the velocity? I think I'll need to calculate the velocity based on the energy and mass. Since the particle is produced with energy E, which is much higher than its rest mass, maybe we can approximate it as a relativistic particle. But wait, E is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So E is about 6.66 times the rest mass (since E_rest is m*c²). Hmm, that's pretty relativistic.

So the energy of the particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV. Let me think about natural units where c = 1 and ħ = 1. So in those units, E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², but since c=1, m is just GeV. So E = γ m, so γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

The velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that. Wait, sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))). So with γ = 6.6667, 1/(γ²) is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887 ≈ 0.9887c. Close to the speed of light, which makes sense for a high-energy particle.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Wait, in natural units, ħ is about 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So let me convert units properly. Because Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approx 20.56875 * 1e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24. Because 20e-25 is 2e-24.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. But I need to be precise here, maybe I should carry more decimals. Let me recalculate: 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Right.

Now, the decay distance L is v * τ. Since v is approximately 0.9887c, and c is about 3e8 m/s. So let's compute L: (0.9887 * c) * τ.

So let's plug in the numbers. L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 3e8 * 0.9887 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875. Let me compute that. 2 * 2.966 is 5.932, but wait, 2.056875 is approximately 2.0569.

2 * 2.966 = 5.932. 0.0569 * 2.966 ≈ 0.168. So total is approximately 5.932 + 0.168 = 6.100. So 6.1e-16 meters? Wait, but wait, 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16. So 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.104.

Wait, 2 * 2.056875 is about 4.11375. 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see, 0.9 * 2.056875 is 1.8511875, 0.066 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.1356. So 1.8511875 + 0.1356 = 1.9867875. So total is 4.11375 + 1.9867875 = 6.1005375. So about 6.1005e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are in 1e-15 or 1e-16 ranges. The options are A) ~5e-16, B) ~4e-15, C) ~5e-15, D) ~4e-16. Hmm, none of the options match 6e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up a calculation step. Let me double-check. Let's recalculate the velocity. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating v.

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). γ is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666667. So 1/(γ²) = 1/(44.4444) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v = 0.9887c. That seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the lifetime. Let me recheck τ = ħ / Γ. The reduced Planck constant is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 s·GeV) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

So then L = v * τ = (0.9887c) * (2.056875e-24 s).

c is 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * (1e8 * 1e-24) ) = (6.104) * 1e-16.

So 6.104e-16 meters. Hmm, that's about 6e-16 meters. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, is the decay width Γ used correctly?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean proper lifetime is τ, but the moving particle's lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Wait! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Because when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than τ. Because τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame), and when the particle is moving, the lab frame sees a longer lifetime. So I think I messed that up.

Wait, I thought τ is the proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ * τ. Because the moving particle's clock runs slower from the lab's perspective. Wait no, no. Wait, from the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is τ. But from the lab frame, where the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer, so it's γ * tau. Because of time dilation. So I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that.

Oh, wait, that changes everything. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ * τ. So τ_lab is gamma multiplied by the intrinsic lifetime.

So let me recalculate. So τ_lab = gamma * (ħ / Γ).

So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667.

Thus, τ_lab = 6.6667 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

Wait, let me compute this again.

First, compute ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Then multiply by gamma (6.6667): 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 13.711e-24 s, which is 1.3711e-23 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24: 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23. 0.6667 *2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-24. So total is about 1.3711e-23 s.

Wait, no, I think I miscalculated. Let me compute 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

6 times 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.6667 times 2.056875e-24: 0.6667 * 2.056875 is approx 1.3711, so 1.3711e-24.

Adding 1.234125e-23 + 1.3711e-24 = 1.3711e-23 + 1.234125e-23 = 2.6052e-23 s? Wait, no, wait, 6.6667 is 6 + 2/3, so 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 * 2.056875e-24) + (2/3 * 2.056875e-24).

So 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

(2/3)*2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37125e-24.

Adding them together: 1.234125e-23 + 0.137125e-23 = 1.37125e-23 s.

So tau_lab is approximately 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Wait, no, that's 1.37125e-23 s. Wait, wait, 6.6667 is approximately 20/3, right? So (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) / 3 * 1e-24.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375. Divided by 3 gives about 13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 s is 1.37125e-23 s. Correct.

Now, the decay distance L = v * tau_lab. Since v is approximately 0.9887c.

So L = 0.9887 * c * tau_lab.

c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau_lab (1.37125e-23 s): 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = (2.9661 * 1.37125) * (1e8 * 1e-23) ) = (approx 4.065) * 1e-15 meters.

Wait, that gives 4.065e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option D is 4.0655e-16.

Wait, so 4.065e-15 is option B. So that would be the correct answer.

But let me check the math again. Let's compute 2.9661 * 1.37125.

Approximately, 3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375, but since it's 2.9661, which is about 3 - 0.0339, so 4.11375 - (0.0339 * 1.37125).

0.0339 * 1.37125 ≈ 0.0466. So 4.11375 - 0.0466 ≈ 4.06715. So approximately 4.067e-15 m. Which is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start with the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay width is related to the particle's lifetime in its rest frame (\( \tau \)) by the formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma},
\]

where \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck constant) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Substituting \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

However, since the particle is moving relativistically, the lifetime in the lab frame (\( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)) is longer due to time dilation. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The lab-frame lifetime is then:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) is the product of the particle's velocity \( v \) and its lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \):

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]

For a relativistic particle, the velocity \( v \) is approximately \( 0.9887c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Substituting \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
L = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} = (2.9661 \cdot 1.37125) \cdot 10^{-15}.
\]

The product \( 2.9661 \cdot 1.37125 \) is approximately \( 4.0655 \). Therefore:

\[
L \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
