Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about a star whose effective temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. 

Astronomers are looking at the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us that the ratio of populations (n_upper/n_lower) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait—the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is spotted (lower Teff), the ratio is lower. So, without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and the ratio is higher. So we're looking for the ratio when T is 6000 K divided by the ratio when T is 5500 K.

The energy levels in question correspond to a transition wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think I need to find the energy difference ΔE from this wavelength. Oh right, because the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So ΔE should be equal to hc/λ.

Let me note down the constants:
h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.
λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters.

So calculating ΔE:
ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) =
