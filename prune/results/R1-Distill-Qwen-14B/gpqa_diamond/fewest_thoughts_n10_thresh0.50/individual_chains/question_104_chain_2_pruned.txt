Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

Alright, the setup says there are two stars with the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass like Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things.

They detected the planets using the RV method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

So, the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) / (1 AU) )

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) ).

Wait, another approach: the formula I recall is K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ), but perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P.

Wait, another thought: the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^2 * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have the same mass, and the orbits are circular (so eccentricity e=0), the main variables here are the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

The relationship between K and P. Let me think: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period P^(1/3), but wait, no. Let me get the formula straight.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(-1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) ] / (M_*^(-2/3)) )

Wait, another approach. The RV method's K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe a better way is to think about the equation that relates K, P, and other factors when M_* >> M_p. Since both planets have masses similar to Neptune, but the stars are similar to the Sun, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.
