Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down each step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided. Let's look at the hints first.

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, so phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. The ylide would attack the carbonyl group in A and form an alkene.

So, the product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, the propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent on the cyclopentane ring at position 4. Let me draw this structure mentally.

The structure is a cyclopentane ring. At position 4 (if I number the ring so that position 1 is one substituent, then position 2, 3, 4, etc., are adjacent), there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so it's a methylene group attached to a cyclopentane and a methyl group. Wait, the structure would be something like cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. Let me think:

1,2-dimethyl means there are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. Then, 4-(propan-2-ylidene) is a substituent on position 4, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. Wait, no: propan-
