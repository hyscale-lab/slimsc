Okay, so I have this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So parallax (plx) = 1 / distance. Or wait, plx = 1 / d, where d is in parsecs. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem is asking how the number of stars (N) changes with distance per unit range. So, I think I need to express N in terms of distance and then find how it scales with r (distance).

Let me write down the given relationship. Number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ plx^(-5). But plx is 1/d, so substituting that in: N ∝ (1/d)^(-5) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but what's the question again? It's about how the number changes with distance r. So N is proportional to r^5? So as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. 

Wait, but the options are about how it changes per unit range of distance. Oh, wait I think I might have confused something. Because the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of
