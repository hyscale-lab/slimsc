Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of angular momentum operators. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y for a muon. The operator is given by A_y = c · S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

Wait, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices often come into play. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used to describe spin. So maybe S here is one of them. Let me think—what's the structure of S? The given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Hmm, wait, the standard Pauli matrices are usually written without the i's in the same way, but maybe I should double-check.

Wait, the standard Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Oh, right! So S is actually σy. Because S has 0, -i in the first row and i,0 in the second. So S is σy. So A_y is c times σy.

But wait, wait, the question says A_y = c·S. Oh, right, and c is h/(4π). So let's write that out. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ. So, to find a, I'll have to find the eigenvalues of A_y.

But first, let me think about σy. The eigenvalues of σy should be ±i, because σy is a Hermitian matrix times i? Wait, wait, no. Wait, σy is a Hermitian matrix, right? Because it's a Pauli matrix. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, σx, σy, σz are Hermitian. Because σy dagger is equal to σy? Let
