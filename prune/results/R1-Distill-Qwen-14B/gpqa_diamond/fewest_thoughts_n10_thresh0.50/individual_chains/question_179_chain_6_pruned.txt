Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. Then, there are four options (A to D), and I need to pick the correct statement.

First, I should recall some quantum mechanics concepts. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Also, the evolution operator (which relates to time evolution) is a unitary matrix. Additionally, the exponential of a matrix appears in the time evolution operator through the Schrödinger equation.

So, let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, for the norm to change, e^X must not be unitary. Because if a matrix is unitary, multiplying a vector by it preserves the norm. So if e^X is not unitary, then the norm could change. 

Wait, but when is e^M unitary? I think if M is Hermitian, then e^M is not necessarily unitary. Wait, no. Let me think again. If M is skew-Hermitian (i.e., M† = -M), then e^M is unitary because (e^M)† = e^{-M} = e^{M†} = e^{-M}, which is the inverse if M is skew-Hermitian. So if X is not skew-Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary.

So what is X? Let me check the matrix X.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Wait, to find if X is skew-Hermitian, I need to compute X† and see if it equals -X.

X† is the conjugate transpose. So let's compute each element.

X has elements X_{jk}, so X†_{kj} = conjugate(X_{jk}).

Let me compute X†:

First row of X is [i, -1, 2i]. So the first column of X† is the conjugate
