Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves a little back and forth, and that shifts the spectral lines we observe.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the main variables here are the Doppler shifts observed, which relate to the velocity of the stars.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically how much longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by some equation involving the masses and the orbital period.

Oh right! The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait another way: K is proportional to (M_p
