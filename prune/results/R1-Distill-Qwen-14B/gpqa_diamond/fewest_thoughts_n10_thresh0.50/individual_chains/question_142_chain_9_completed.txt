Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, this question is asking about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. Maybe it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better. 

So, |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So when I compute each term:
|0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is a matrix with 1 in the (2,2) position.

Adding those two matrices together gives a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 1/2. So the matrix ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

I think this represents a completely mixed state. Because a completely mixed state in a qubit can be represented as the maximally mixed state, which is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix. But how does this translate into the Bloch sphere?

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubits. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ would be |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but here we have a mixed state.

Wait, the given ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. I think that this corresponds to the point at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the center is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the representation. Let me think again. The general form of a qubit's density matrix is [[a, b], [c, d]], with a + d = 1 for trace preservation. For the Bloch vector, the components are x, y, z. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. 

The density matrix can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So let's compute that.

Given ρ = (I)/2, since |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is I, multiplied by 1/2. So ρ = I/2. So when we write this in terms of the Pauli matrices:

I/2 = (I + 0·σ_x + 0·σ_y + 0·σ_z)/2. Because the identity matrix is (σ_0), and the other terms are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

Ah, so that's the center of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is at the origin. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). 

So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this becomes:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, which is the maximally mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, which is a geometric way to visualize quantum states, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states lie inside it. The center of the Bloch sphere corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, since it is diagonal and equal to \( \frac{1}{2} I \), there are no components of the Pauli matrices (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) present. This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero, meaning the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
