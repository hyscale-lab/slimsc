Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain types of axes and planes. C3h symmetry specifically refers to a three-fold axis of rotation combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Oh right, the notation is a bit tricky. I remember that the C in the notation stands for 'cyclic', and the subscript denotes the order of the rotation. So C3 would be a three-fold rotation axis. The h for horizontal indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane that passes through the axis. So the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees and look the same, and also has a horizontal mirror plane.

So the question is about identifying which of the four molecules has this C3h symmetry. The options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, another compound, and a fourth option.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, the name sounds complex. Triphenylene indicates a structure with three phenyl groups attached. The 'trifuran' part suggests three furan rings attached. But wait, the substituents might affect the symmetry. I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but maybe it's a large molecule with several rings.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So this is another compound with a benzo ring fused with a trifuran system. The substitution pattern might lead to certain symmetries. The numbering is a bit confusing, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure of triisopropyl borate is [B(OiPr)3], where OiPr is isopropoxy. Boron has a trigonal planar geometry. Each isopropoxy group is attached to the boron. Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a
