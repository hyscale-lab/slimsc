Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and think about what's happening.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure, right?

Step 1: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it's heated with dihalides, it's usually an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So I'm thinking this is a dehydrohalogenation. The product would be an adamantane with a double bond between the two carbons where the bromines were. So the product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but wait, when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. So the product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. Hmm, that's probably the protons adjacent to the double bond. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) are likely the bridging or cage protons, maybe in a multiplet. Then 1.94 ppm (2H), maybe more deshielded, perhaps the protons on the double bond. Wait, wait, no, if it's a diene, maybe the protons are on adjacent carbons. But wait, in an adamantane structure, the double bond would be within the structure, perhaps leading to certain symmetry.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh, wait, but wait, elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Did I get the reaction wrong? Because if KOH is with something else, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with excess KOH. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But then what about the IR at 1720? That's a
