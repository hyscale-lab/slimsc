Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator, specifically for a muon. Hmm, muons are like heavy electrons, but I don't think the particle type affects the calculation here; it's more about the angular momentum or spin operators. 

The question is asking about the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That probably means the direction can be described using an angle θ from the z-axis, but since it's in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 or π? Well, maybe not exactly, but for an arbitrary direction in x-z, the vector n can be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. But wait, the operator is along n, so it's a spin component in that direction. 

The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Wait, no, the standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right? So that's what's given here. And P
