Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are A to D, each combining different symmetries.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimensionality, like dimension 6, 8, etc. The key thing about SMEFT is that it maintains the same gauge symmetry as the Standard Model. But wait, what about other symmetries?

I think about the symmetries that the Standard Model respects. Well, the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry because all the particles are described by Lorentz-invariant fields—like how the Dirac equation for fermions or the Klein-Gordon equation for bosons work. So SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry because it's an effective theory built on the same principles. So symmetry 1, Lorentz, is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Hmm. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz and translational symmetries? So if the theory has Poincare symmetry, it must also have Lorentz symmetry. But does SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Or can it be broken in some way?

In the Standard Model, Poincare symmetry is part of the framework, but when considering effective theories, sometimes people talk about "soft" breaking of symmetries. Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and for it to make sense, it should still respect the same basic symmetries. Because any operator that breaks Poincare would make the theory non-renormalizable in a bad way, or maybe not even a valid effective theory.

Wait, another angle: The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it necessarily have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes not just Lorentz transformations but also translations. So if the theory is built in a way that includes all possible terms respecting Lorentz, wouldn't it also respect Poincare?

Wait, no, maybe not. Because Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of the theory being valid in all inertial frames, including translations. But SMEFT could, in principle, have operators that have momentum dependence, but in SMEFT, operators are local and constructed from the SM fields, so they should respect momentum conservation. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that the SM respects Poincare symmetry. Since SMEFT is an extension, it should also respect Poincare. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries (options 1 and 2) must be respected. So that would point towards option A or C. Because in the choices, A is 1 and 2, C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Poincare symmetry is more about the overall spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations. If the operators in SMEFT are written in a way that's local and respects the usual symmetries, then they would respect Poincare. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So I'll tentatively say 1 and 2 are required.

Next, what about CP symmetry (option 3) and CPT symmetry (option 4). I remember that CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories that are Lorentz-invariant. Because of the way QFT is structured, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically must respect CPT symmetry. So CPT is a must (option 4).

CP symmetry is a different matter. CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric on its own because of things like the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So in SMEFT, operators can be CP-even or CP-odd. Wait, but do they have to respect CP symmetry?

I think the SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP because the original SM doesn't respect CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to conserve CP. So option 3, CP, is not necessarily respected. So symmetry 3 is not a must.

So putting it all together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

- Lorentz (1): Yes.
- Poincare (2): Also yes, as it's part of the framework.
- CP (3): No, operators can violate it.
- CPT (4): Yes, because Lorentz implies CPT.

So the required symmetries are 1,2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare might not be a separate symmetry here. Because if the theory is built respecting Lorentz, then Poincare is automatically included? Or is Poincare a separate symmetry that must be explicitly considered?

Wait, Poincare symmetry is the combination of translational symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. So if the operators in SMEFT are local, they automatically respect both. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it's also respecting Poincare because all the terms are local. So I think both 1 and 2 must be respected. So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which includes 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators while maintaining key symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it builds on the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be preserved.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local effective theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry, as all operators are constructed from local fields.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry, and SMEFT allows for operators that can also violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of quantum field theories that respect Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
