Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right, red phosphorus with HI is a common reaction—I think that's for the hydrolysis of esters or maybe some kind of substitution. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or something else? Or maybe it's used to eliminate something. Wait, no, I'm confusing it. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI together—oh yeah, that's the reaction where an ester is converted into an acid. Because I remember that when you have an ester reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, the ester gets hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. So for example, an ester R-O-CO-R' would become R-OH and R'-COOH. Wait, no, wait, when you hydrolyze an ester with HI and red P, it's usually acid-catalyzed and leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So that's the reaction I'm thinking of.

But first, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

The IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, probably an O-H stretch. But wait, in the 3400 region, it could be either
