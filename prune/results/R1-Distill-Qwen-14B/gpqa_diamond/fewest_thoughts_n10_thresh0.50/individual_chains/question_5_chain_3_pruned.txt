Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, okay. So the operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) times a specific matrix. I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, these operators are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each of these corresponds to the components of the spin operator S multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, but here it's P, not S. Maybe P is the spin operator, but let's just go with the given matrices.

So the task is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is (θ, 0) in spherical coordinates, I think, meaning the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi is 0 because it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, the eigenvector for spin in a particular direction. I remember that when you have a spin-½ particle, the eigenstates for spin along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So our eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

The operator P must be the spin operator along the direction n, which is a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. That is, P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. Because n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz, where (n_x, n_z) are the components of the unit vector in the x-z plane.

But wait, n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the z-component is cosθ, but if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the direction would have x-component sinθ and z-component cosθ. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since we're in 2D (for a spin-½ system), the state is a two-component vector, so perhaps we'll represent the direction as a vector in the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane. So the vector n would have components (a, 0, b), but since it's a unit vector, a² + b² =1. But for a 2-level system, the spin state is represented as a point on the Bloch sphere, so the direction is given by angles θ and φ. Since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so the state is θ with respect to the z-axis.

So the operator P is the spin component along n, so P = n · σ, where σ represents the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Wait, because each component P_x is (ħ/2) σx, etc.

So let me write P as:

P = n_x (ħ/2) σx + n_z (ħ/2) σz

Because n_y is zero. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me define n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Then,

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ]

Wait, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting these in,

P = (ħ/2) [
