Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit detection. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. 

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But since both stars have the same radius, that's interesting. The question is about transit probability, so I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

The formula for the probability of a transit is P = (R_planet + R_star) / a. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / a) multiplied by (something else?), or is it (R_planet / R_star) over something?

Wait, no, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, I think it's more accurate to say that the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star) squared, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no. I think the transit probability is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius, but scaled by some other factors. Oh wait, actually, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. For a circular orbit, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3))) )? No, that might
