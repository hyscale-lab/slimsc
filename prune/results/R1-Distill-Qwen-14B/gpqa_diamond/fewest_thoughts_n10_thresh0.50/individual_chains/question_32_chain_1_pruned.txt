Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so I think that's Li-6 or something. Wait, let me think, Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 +3 =6, so it's Li-6.

Right, so I need to find the energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28. Let me compute that. 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check: 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2: 0.96 *0.96. 0.96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96^2=0.9216. Then 1-0.9216=0.0784. Square root of 0.0784: Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 28^2 is 784, so yeah. So 1/sqrt(0.0784) is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

But maybe I should use more precise values. Let me think: 1/0.28 is exactly 100/28 = 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma times m c squared. I need to find m, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 atom is needed. Wait, but I think they just want the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. So the rest mass energy is m c², and then multiplied by gamma.

What's the mass of Li-6? Let's see. The atomic mass
