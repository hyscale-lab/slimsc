Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Oh right, this probably involves some relativity or maybe just relative velocity concepts. 

So the setup: A light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. The question is asking for the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Oh wait, but when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light? I'm a bit confused here. 

In the classic case, when a medium is moving, like water, and you have light moving through it, the speed is v = c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. Because light's speed in the medium is determined by the medium's properties. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. What if the medium is moving relative to the observer?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the medium is moving. So is the light's speed in the lab frame still c? Or does the medium's motion affect it?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. So, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as
