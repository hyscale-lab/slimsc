Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when it's passing through the equilibrium point, right? But this is relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play here.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but that's in the non-relativistic case. Wait, but in relativity, things change because mass increases with velocity.

The question is about the maximum speed v_max. In the non-relativistic case, maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But this is a relativistic case, so option C can't be the right answer here.

Right, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's higher because of the gamma factor. The total energy of a relativistic particle includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

But wait, the oscillator's total energy would be the sum of potential and kinetic energy at any point. At maximum displacement (A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma-1)mc². So at maximum amplitude x=A, potential energy U is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all of this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc² 

Hmm, but wait, the total energy at equilibrium would be gamma mc², which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. So,

Total energy E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.
