Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Hmm, let's see what I need to do here.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. The key thing is to find out which stars can be observed by both spectrographs. I remember that each spectrograph has a limit on the apparent V magnitude of the stars it can detect. For ESPRESSO, it's stars brighter than 17 mag, and for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag. Oh wait, so both can detect brighter than their respective limits, meaning lower magnitudes are better (since higher magnitudes are fainter). So to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag, because that's the lower limit for HIRES, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So any star beyond 16 mag can be seen by HIRES but not necessarily ESPRESSO, but wait no, wait: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (V < 17). So if a star is brighter than 16 mag, it's definitely brighter than 17? No, wait: 16 is brighter than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star has V=16, both can observe it. If a star has V=17, only ESPRESSO can. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must have apparent V mag ≤ 16 for HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the star's apparent V needs to be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. So only stars with apparent V ≤ 16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but I think I should make a table for each star to compute their apparent V magnitudes, considering any extinction (dust) if applicable.

Let me review each star:

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude Mv =15.5
- Distance d =10 pc
- Since Mv is the absolute magnitude (what it would look like at 10 pc), the apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: V = Mv + 5 log10(d/10)
