Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says it's a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, like the ground state. So the molecule is in its ground state, and absorbing a photon would take it to the next higher state.

Hmm, the options given are different momenta, and I need to calculate which one is correct. The given data includes masses (Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu), bond length R=2 angstroms, and angular frequency w=4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in the quantum mechanical model of diatomic molecules, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the question specifies the rotation-vibration model. Oh, wait, maybe it's considering both rotation and vibration, but perhaps the transition here involves a change in vibrational state, since the problem mentions switching to the next lowest energy state. Or is it possible that it's a transition involving rotation? Or maybe both?

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, right? So the next state with the lowest possible energy would
