Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots affecting the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

First, the star's parameters: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. When no spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% spots, Teff drops to 5500K. The ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two levels decreases when spots are present. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when there's no spot, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. So the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

But wait, the ratio given is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. So let me denote the energy levels as level 1 (lower energy) and level 2 (higher energy). So E2 > E1.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), which is the same as exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. When spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower (5500K vs 6000K). So let's think about how T affects the ratio.

If the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio n1/n2? Let's see. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the factor decreases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, but the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So without spots
