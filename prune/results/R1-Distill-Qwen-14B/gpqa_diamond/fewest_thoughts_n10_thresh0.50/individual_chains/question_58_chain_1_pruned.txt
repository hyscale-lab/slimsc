Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite results that don't make physical sense. It's a way to make the calculations finite so you can proceed without running into these infinities. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or because another approach handles the divergences.

Regularization methods include things like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, Pauli-Villars regularization, etc. These methods help in making loop integrals converge.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, particles are not point-like but extended, so maybe the divergences are tamed. Or wait, do they still require regularization? I'm not too sure. I remember that string theories have different perturbative expansions, like the superstring has a certain kind of behavior. But I think that in some cases, like in certain limits or when considering loop diagrams, they might not have the same divergences as other QFTs. Or maybe they do, but they handle them differently, perhaps through the structure of the theory itself rather than explicit regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, which is why perturbative methods work there. But in terms of regularization, I think QCD calculations do require regularization because loop integrals can still diverge. So they must use methods like lattice regularization or others. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has issues with divergences, especially in loop diagrams. For example, the calculation of the electron self-energy leads to infinities, which are handled using renormalization. But renormalization is related to regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization because it has divergent integrals that need to be handled. So option C would require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version. Classical ED doesn't involve quantum fields, just Maxwell's equations and point charges. Since it's not a quantum theory, it doesn't really have the same kind of divergences as in QED or QCD. Wait, but even in classical ED, when you have point charges, you get problems like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. How is that handled? Well, in classical theory, maybe you just accept that as a limitation, but you don't use regularization techniques because regularization is a quantum field theory tool. So if the question is about whether the theory ever requires regularization, then classical ED doesn't need it because it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, but the question is about "never requires regularization at high energies." So the options are theories, and which
