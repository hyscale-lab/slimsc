Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me see— the structure looks like a Yukawa coupling term. Typically, Yukawa interactions have the form something like g ψ̄ ψ X, where X is a scalar field. So in this case, the interaction term seems to involve the scalar X coupled to fermion fields ψ_f.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So actually, it's something like the Yukawa term, but perhaps it's written in a way that's a bit non-standard. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as X(y) coupling to the fermion fields. So the interaction term would lead to X coupling to fermions, right?

So the boson X is a scalar here because the field X(y) is a scalar. That makes sense because the Yukawa interaction couples a scalar to fermions. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs.

The question is, what are the kinematically allowed decay channels for X? The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to consider all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, based on their masses and whether the interaction allows it.

Let me think about the particles that can be produced. The fermions in the Standard Model include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), charged leptons (electron, muon, tau), and their corresponding neutrinos. But wait, the interaction term here is for fermions ψ_f, and the coupling would be to the X boson. But in the Lagrangian, I see ψ̄_f (y) multiplied by X(y), so the interaction is between X and the fermions ψ_f. So which fermions are these? Are all the fermions included,
