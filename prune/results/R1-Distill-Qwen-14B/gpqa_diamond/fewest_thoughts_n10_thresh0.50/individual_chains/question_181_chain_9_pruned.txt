Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm. Let me try to think through this.

Wait, so the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, I need to find Flux1 / Flux2 after the pp-III branch stops.

I remember that the pp chain is the main source of solar energy. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branchesâ€”I think pp-III is the main contributor to the high-energy neutrinos. Oh wait, neutrinos are produced in the proton-proton chain, right? And the pp-III branch is the dominant one because it produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? The pp-III branch is responsible for producing a significant amount of neutrinos, especially those with higher energies. So if it stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos would drop.

But how does this affect the two bands? Let's think about the energy distribution. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with a certain energy spectrum. If it stops, the flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would be mostly from other sources, maybe the pp-I or pp-II branches or other processes.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped. The other reactions, like the other branches of the pp chain or maybe other fusion processes, are still happening. So, what do the other branches contribute in terms of neutrinos?

I think the pp-I and pp-II branches contribute lower energy neutrinos. For example, the pp-I branch produces 17.6 MeV neutrinos, but maybe that's not directly relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the other branches contribute neutrinos in lower energy ranges. So the higher energy neutrinos (like 800 keV and above) are mainly from pp-III.

If pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop, but lower energy bands might remain unchanged. Wait, but the question is about the ratio between two bands, both in 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So both are high-energy, but if pp-III is the main source of the higher end, stopping
