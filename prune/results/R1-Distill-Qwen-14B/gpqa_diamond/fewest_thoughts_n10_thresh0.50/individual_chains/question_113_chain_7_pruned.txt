Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. The options given are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The clues come from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data.

Let me start by breaking down each piece of information. 

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. The broadness is often due to hydrogen bonding, which is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, sometimes even broader than alcohols. But I'm not sure yet. 

Next, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 area is a classic for carbonyl groups. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, but that region is also where conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents (like in an ester or conjugated ketone) might absorb. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't see any info suggesting that here.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to the CH2 groups in a double bond, right? So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the structure has a conjugated system, perhaps with a carbonyl group.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry part: a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm. Common fragments at 45 m/z... I remember that the CH3O group (methoxy) has a mass of 31 (if I add 15 (O) + 16 (CH3)). Wait, no, 15 for O and CH3 is 15 (C=12, H3=3*1=3, so 15 total). So 12+16=28? No wait, CH3O is 15 (CH3) plus 1
