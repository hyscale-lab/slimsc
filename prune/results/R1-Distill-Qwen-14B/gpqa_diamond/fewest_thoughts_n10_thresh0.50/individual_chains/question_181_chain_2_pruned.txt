Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let's see. The scenario says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy, especially the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is one of the stages where three protons fuse into a helium-3 nucleus, and then two of them combine into helium-4, releasing a lot of energy, including neutrinos.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? The pp chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, right? Because in the pp-I branch, two protons fuse into a deuteron, then another proton comes in to make tritium, which decays into helium-3 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Then, the helium-3 nuclei can either combine in the pp-II branch to make helium-4 and two protons, or in the pp-III branch, they combine with another helium-3 to make helium-4 and two protons. So the pp-III is a part of the main proton-proton chain.

So if pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would also stop. Wait, but in the Sun, most of the neutrinos come from the pp chain, specifically the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant, but I think pp-III is a minor part compared to pp-I. Or maybe not? Wait, I think the pp chain contributes the majority of the solar neutrinos, with the main peak around 200-300 keV, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

But the problem is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I'm guessing these bands are from certain parts of the pp chain.

Wait, neutrinos from the Sun are produced mainly via the proton-proton chain. The specific neutrinos are the electron neutrinos (Î½e) emitted in the beta decay steps. The energies of these neutrinos depend on the reaction steps. For the pp-I branch, the neutrinos are lower energy, around 200-300 keV. But the pp-III branch might produce higher energy neutrinos because the reactions involve higher mass particles.

Wait, no, maybe
