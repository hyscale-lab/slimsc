Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to walk through each part carefully. 

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent positions? Wait, no, in adamantane, the numbering might be a bit different. But regardless, when dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it probably forms an alkene. 

So when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, it's likely undergoing an elimination reaction. Since it's a dihalide, the KOH would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I think. Wait, no, because elimination of two HBr molecules would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Or maybe it's a different position. Alternatively, maybe the product is a more substituted alkene because of the structure of adamantane. 

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I think when alkenes form, especially from dihalides, the product is an alkene. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch.
