Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there are three reagents used in a reaction sequence. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let me look at the reagents:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This makes me think of diazotization. Diazonium salts are usually formed when aromatic amines react with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl). So maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

2. H2O: After diazotization, if we treat with water, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to form phenols, especially if heated. Alternatively, maybe it's a Sandmeyer reaction, but that usually involves different conditions like CuCN or other metals.

3. aq. KOH, Heat: Hydroxide under heat... That sounds like a possible elimination reaction. Maybe the compound has some leaving groups after the first step, leading to an elimination to form a double bond or something.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7. That's a high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might suggest coupling with two protons. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton next to an activating group, but I'm not sure.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe aromatic ring with substituents. If it's a para-substituted ring, like para-substituted benzene, this could be the protons adjacent to the substituent. Or perhaps part of a conjugated system.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, another two protons. Maybe another pair of aromatic protons, perhaps in a di-substituted benzene ring or part of a conjugated diene.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like
