Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI usually lead me to think of the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Oh wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, right? Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. So if the starting material is a ketone, it would become a secondary alcohol, but wait, no, no. Wait, no. Clemmensen is for ketones to alkanes. Wait, maybe it's the other reaction. Like, maybe benzophenone with HI and red phosphorus would give diphenylmethane? Or perhaps that's the other reaction. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, the reaction of a carbonyl with HI and red phosphorus would typically be a reduction. Wait, when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with HX in presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus, it would probably get converted into an alcohol. Or wait, maybe it's the other way. Wait, no, Clemmensen is for converting ketones to alkanes, so that's a deoxygenation. So, if X has a ketone group, then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

But first, let's look at the spectral data to figure out what compound X is. 

The IR data shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which probably indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, all the products seem to be either acids or aromatics with substituents. Wait, but the IR also has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. But 1720 is more likely a ketone (maybe around 1700-1750 cm-1). There's also a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe compound X is an aromatic ketone.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong singlet, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aromatic aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but that's more for RCHO. Alternatively, an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But 10.5 is a bit high. Wait, but in the IR, I don't see a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1 that would indicate a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR shows 3400-2500, which is a broad region. Maybe an O-H from a phenol or an alcohol? Or maybe an aldehyde. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000. The 10.5 ppm in the NMR is more likely an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the IR would show a strong peak around 2800-2700 (stretching for the aldehyde C-H) and the carbonyl at 1720. So maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde. 

Wait, but looking back at the IR, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which would fit with a ketone or aldehyde. So maybe the structure is something with an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are likely para-disubstituted aromatic protons. So, it's a para-substituted benzene, perhaps. The two doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons, which would be the case for a substituent in the para position. So like a substituent attached to the benzene ring that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H each. So, that suggests a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that's attached in the para position.

Wait, but the substituent could be a carbonyl group, or perhaps something else. Let me think.

Next, looking at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps part of a ketone or another group. Or maybe it's a methine proton in a substituent attached to the aromatic ring.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three Hs, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2 or something. 

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3 group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring is probably an isopropyl or some kind of branched chain. Let me see. Looking at the options, the products are either benzoic acids or isobutyl or sec-butyl benzene derivatives.

So, the NMR suggests that the substituent on the benzene is a group that has a chain. Let's think about the structure. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggest a -CH2CH2CH3 group, but the 1.4 is a doublet. Wait, that's more like a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2. So, maybe it's a (CH2)2CH3 group? Or perhaps a branching. Alternatively, think of a sec-butyl group: CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the 1.4 ppm would be a CH(CH3)2 group, but wait, that's a triplet of two protons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's take the substituent as a propyl group or something. So, the substituent is a group like -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that would be a tert-butyl group, but the NMR doesn't show a singlet for a tert-butyl (which would be around 1.2 ppm as a singlet for the three CH3 groups attached to a central C). Wait, but here, the 1.4 is a doublet (d, 3H), and 0.9 is a triplet (t, 3H). Hmm, that's more like a ethyl group attached to something else. Let me think about the substituent.

Looking at the substituent's structure: the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group. So, perhaps a substituent like -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something else. Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that's a straight chain, which would give a triplet at 0.9 and perhaps a quartet around 1.6. But in the NMR, the 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H, which is perhaps next to a CH group (the 2.9 ppm m). So, maybe the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group. Let's think about that.

A sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. The structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, no. Let me correct: The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene via the central CH. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- (no, wait, that's isobutyl. Maybe I'm getting this confused). Wait, the substituent is probably a isopropyl group, but let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Wait, let me think about all the NMR signals.

The substituent attached to the benzene must have a structure that leads to the NMR signals. So the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group, perhaps next to another CH2 group. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to that CH. Then, the 1.4 (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH group. And the 0.9 (t, 3H) is a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that doesn't quite add up. Maybe the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to another CH2? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so options B and D are isobutyl and sec-butyl benzene derivatives, while A and C are benzoic acids with substituents.

So, looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl. So if X has a carbonyl group, then the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be an alcohol (if the carbonyl is a ketone) or an alkane (if it's a reduction of aldehyde to CH2 group, perhaps). Wait, wait. Let me think again about the reaction. Clemmensen reduction converts ketones to alkanes, using HCl and Zn(Hg). But red phosphorus and HI is another reducing agent. Maybe I'm mixing them up.

Wait, another reaction: the reduction of a ketone (RCOR') to RCH2R' using H2/Pd isn't applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol using something else. No, wait, Clemmensen is for ketones to alkanes (removes the oxygen), whereas the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols is done with something like NaBH4 or LiAlH4. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that's for benzene rings, so that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but that's for ketones to alcohols.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the initial step of figuring out what X is. Let me go back to the NMR and IR.

The IR shows a strong peak around 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is probably a carbonyl proton. Wait, but in a carbonyl like a ketone, the C=O doesn't have protons. So an aldehyde would have a proton at around 9-10 ppm. But the 10.5 is a bit high. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the IR, the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid would be very broad and strong, probably in the 2500-3000 cm-1 region. However, the IR given shows 3400-2500, which is a broad region, but the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. So if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which is close to 1720. So that's possible. So perhaps compound X is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the para position and a carboxylic acid group in the para position. Wait, but wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which would fit a carboxylic acid proton. But the aromatic region would be more downfield if there's a strong electron-withdrawing group like a COOH.

Looking at the aromatic protons in the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each with two equivalent protons. For example, if the ring has both a -COOH and a substituent like -R in the para position. So, in that case, the ring would have two substituents in the para positions, each having two equivalent protons.

Wait, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1 (or maybe position 4; depends on numbering). Wait, but the substituents would be in the para positions, so the aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets. So that matches the NMR data.

But let's check the NMR of option C.

If the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the structure would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group at para positions.

The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. The substitution pattern would lead to each pair of aromatic protons being equivalent.

The COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the adjacent aromatic protons would be deshielded, appearing downfield. The substituent in the para position (sec-butyl) is an electron-donating group, which would cause the adjacent protons to be more shielded.

So, the aromatic protons adjacent to COOH would be at higher ppm (more downfield) and those adjacent to the sec-butyl would be at lower ppm.

So, perhaps the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) are the protons ortho to the COOH, and the 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are the protons ortho to the sec-butyl group. That would make sense.

Now, the NMR signals for the substituent (sec-butyl group):

A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)- something? Wait, let me get that right. The structure for a sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that can't be. Wait, butyl groups: the four carbons. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, it's a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, actually, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. More accurately, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring at the second carbon of a butyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the NMR signals for the substituent.

The substituent (assuming it's a sec-butyl group) would have the following structure: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that's not correct. Let me properly draw it.

The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is as follows: the benzene is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH that is connected to two CH3 groups. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that would be a tert-butyl group, because the substituent is attached to a central carbon that's connected to three other carbons. So, the substituent for a tert-butyl is (CH3)3C-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: is a sec-butyl group -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, because that would be a quaternary carbon. Wait, no—the butyl group has four carbons. The substituent is attached at the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. That can't be right because that would be a five-carbon chain. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. Let me think about that. An isopropyl group is -CH(CH3)2. So, attached to the benzene ring. If the substituent is an isopropyl group, then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but in the given NMR, the substituent's protons are split into 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Hmm.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 next to it. The 1.4 (d, 3H) and 0.9 (t, 3H) suggest a methyl group attached to a CH2 that is perhaps part of a longer chain. So, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but how does that fit into the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me try to think of a substituent where the substituent's protons give these signals.

Another approach: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, a terminal CH3 in a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be a CH2 group between the CH and another group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH.

So, putting that together, the substituent is a CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. Hmm. Let me think of the substituent as a 3-methylpentyl group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2-propyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think of the substituent as CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So the structure would be benzene attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. But then, what about the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? That would be a methyl group attached to a CH, which in this case, would be the CH(CH3) group. So, the CH(CH3) would have a neighboring CH2 group. So, the 1.7 ppm would be the CH2 next to the CH(CH3). The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH(CH3) group.

So, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2 group. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But wait, that's a tert-butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl group on the benzene ring, para to each other.

But wait, let's think about the NMR again. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the substituent would have a structure like benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: the substituent is a four-carbon chain attached to the benzene ring at the second carbon. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In that case, the substituent's protons would be as follows:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a neighboring CH2 group. So, the CH would have protons that are split by neighboring groups. 

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The substituent's protons are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably the CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the CH2 group next to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group in a CH2CH2CH3 chain.

Wait, so the substituent would be a group where there's a CH connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Then, the CH2 is attached to the benzene, then a CH group attached to a CH2CH3. So, the NMR would have:

- The CH group would be at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

- The adjacent CH2 group would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

Wait, but then where are the 1.4 and 0.9 ppm signals? The 1.4 (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to the CH. But in this case, the CH is attached to a CH2CH3, not a methyl group. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. Wait, but in para position, so both substituents are in positions 1 and 4? No, wait, the benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps both substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. So, the ring has two substituents: a COOH and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets. The protons adjacent to the COOH (which is electron-withdrawing) would be more deshielded, higher ppm. The protons adjacent to the sec-butyl (electron-donating) would be more shielded, lower ppm. So, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho to the COOH, and the 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho to the sec-butyl group.

That makes sense. So, the aromatic region aligns with option C.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's confirm the NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would have a CH2 group attached to the benzene, followed by a CH group attached to a CH2CH3. So, the CH group would have two neighboring groups: the benzene's CH2 and the CH2CH3. So, the NMR would show:

- The CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H): the CH in the middle.

- The adjacent CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H): the CH2 attached to the benzene.

- The CH2CH3 group: the CH2 would be at around 1.4 ppm (maybe a triplet for the CH2 next to CH(CH2CH3)), but that doesn't quite fit. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. 

So, the CH2 group attached to the benzene is at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), the CH group is at 2.9 ppm (1H), and the CH2CH3 group would have a CH2 at around 1.3 ppm (if it were part of an ethyl group), but the given data shows a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a methyl group. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the substituent is a different group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a butyl group but something else. Let me think about the substituent's NMR.

The substituent's NMR shows:

- 2.9 (m, 1H): a CH group.

- 1.7 (m, 2H): a CH2 group.

- 1.4 (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 (t, 3H): a CH2CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent must have a chain like CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3). So, perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to a CH3 and a CH2CH2CH3. So, the structure would be -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3). But that would require the substituent to be a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH2. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH2 next to CH(CH3), so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2 group. So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, the CH2 group ( attached to benzene) would have protons at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH(CH3)2 would have a CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The two methyl groups (CH3)2 would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 6H?), but in the given NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet of 3H. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, if X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

The reaction is likely a reduction of the carbonyl group. If X is a carboxylic acid (option C), then reacting with a reducing agent would typically convert the COOH group into a CH2 group. Because red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes, I think. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the ketone to an alcohol. Hmm, but I'm not certain about this part.

Wait, the reaction is X with red phosphorus and HI. I think this is the reaction where a ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Or perhaps, more accurately, the reduction of a carbonyl to an alcohol. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. So, for example, if you have a ketone, R-CO-R', upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it would be reduced to R-CH2-R'. So, the carbonyl group is converted into a methylene group.

But wait, in the case of a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure if it would react in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into a methyl group.

Wait, but let me think of the steps. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), which has a COOH group, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which are strong reducing agents, the COOH would be reduced. How? Let me recall: carboxylic acids can be reduced to alkanes using LiAlH4, but red phosphorus and HI might not do that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid but affects another functional group. Hmm, but in option C, the functional group is a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but in the IR data, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which would suggest a carbonyl. So, X has a carbonyl group. So, if X is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is in the COOH group, which would be around 1700 cm-1, which matches the 1720.

So, if X is option C, then the reaction would reduce the COOH group. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the COOH group but reducing another carbonyl group. Wait, but X only has a COOH group as a carbonyl, unless it's a ketone benzoic acid, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which could be a carbonyl proton, but that's only possible in a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but carboxylic acids don't have protons attached to the carbonyl; the proton is on the O-H. So, the 10.5 ppm peak can't be a carboxylic acid proton because that's a broad peak around 12 ppm. So perhaps I was wrong earlier; the compound isn't a carboxylic acid.

Wait, so if the 10.5 ppm is a carbonyl proton, then X must be an aldehyde or a ketone. But then the IR's 1720 cm-1 would fit a ketone. So, perhaps X is an aromatic ketone.

So, looking at the options, which of them are ketones? None of the options A to D are ketones. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the options.

Wait, the options are the products after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, X is the starting material, and the options are the products. So, the reaction is X (with a carbonyl group) being reduced.

So, X has a carbonyl group. So, options A, C have carbonyl groups (if they are propanoic acid or benzoic acid).

But wait, propanoic acid would have a COOH group, which doesn't have a carbonyl proton. So, the 10.5 ppm must be something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps X is an aromatic aldehyde. So, the structure would be benzaldehyde with substituents. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

So, let's think again. If X is an aromatic aldehyde, then the IR would have a peak at around 1720 cm-1 (the aldehyde C=O), and the NMR would have a singlet at around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. The 10.5 ppm is a bit high for an aldehyde, but perhaps it's possible.

So, the aromatic protons would be as given, with two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted ring.

The aldehyde proton is at 10.5 ppm (1H, singlet), which makes sense. The substituent on the ring would have the structure that gives the other NMR signals.

So, the substituent's protons are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent could be a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the structure would be benzene-CHO with a substituent that is a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, such as a isopropyl group attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that would be a tert-butyl group, which would have a singlet for the three CH3 groups, which isn't consistent with the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. So, a pentyl group with a branch. Hmm, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group. So, a substituent where the CH is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 and a CH3.

So, the substituent would be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)(CH3) group attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH3 groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 (d, 3H) and 0.9 (t, 3H).

Wait, that makes sense. The CH at 2.9 is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 (the 0.9 triplet) and a CH3 (the 1.4 doublet). So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

But then, the overall structure of X would be benzaldehyde with a substituent of -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) in the para position. But that doesn't correspond to any of the options given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2 group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But that would be a tert-butyl group, so the NMR would show a singlet for the three CH3 groups. But the given NMR shows a triplet and a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let's think about the reaction. If X is a ketone, then the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be the corresponding alcohol.

But looking at the options, options B and D are isobutyl benzene derivatives, which are alkanes. So, perhaps X is a ketone which, upon reduction, becomes an alcohol, but then maybe further reaction occurs.

Wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI typically reduce ketones to alkanes. Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction as a Clemmensen-like reduction, converting a ketone into an alkane.

So, for example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring with a substituent. For example, something like 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Then, the reaction would reduce the acetophenone to toluene, but with a sec-butyl substituent. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

Wait, let me look at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has a methyl group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position 1. So, it's 4-methyl-1-(sec-butyl)benzene.

But let's see. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it would reduce the ketone (CO) to a CH2 group. So, acetophenone becomes toluene. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is what option D is.

In that case, what would X be? X would be 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone.

Then, looking at the NMR of X, let's see if it fits.

The NMR would have:

- Aldehyde proton? No, because X is a ketone. Wait, no, acetophenone is a ketone, so the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Acetophenone's structure is Ph-CO-CH3. So, the NMR would have a singlet at around 2.6 ppm for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl. But in the given NMR, there's no such peak. Instead, the signals are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So that suggests X isn't acetophenone. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propyl ketone, like CH3-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But that doesn't fit the aromatic NMR.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ketone with a longer substituent. For example, X could be 4-(propyl)phenylacetone. But without more data, it's hard to say.

Maybe I should think of X as a benzophenone derivative. For example, if X is 4-ethylacetophenone, then upon reduction, it would become 4-ethyltoluene. But that doesn't match the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the ring is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, upon reduction of the ketone (if any), it would become benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would not show protons for the ketone.

Wait, but according to the given NMR, the aromatic signals are indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene. So, if X is a ketone with a substituent in the para position, the product would be an alkane with a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propiophenone derivative with a substituent. For example, 4-(sec-butyl)propiophenone. Then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The correct answer is probably option C or D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the IR and NMR data fit a benzoic acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the 10.5 ppm NMR peak couldn't be a carboxylic acid because the O-H would be broad, but maybe that's the case. Let me think again.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet (bs, 1H). For a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 12 ppm. But in the given data, the 10.5 is a singlet, which is not the O-H. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carbonyl proton, which would suggest an aldehyde or ketone. But earlier, the options don't have a ketone or aldehyde as X. Wait, no, the options are the products after reaction, not X.

Wait, no. X is the starting material, and the options are the products. So, the IR and NMR data are for X, not for the product.

So, X has a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), and a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is a carbonyl proton. So, X must be an aldehyde, because a ketone doesn't have a carbonyl proton. So, X is an aromatic aldehyde.

So, the structure of X would be benzaldehyde with a substituent.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent's protons are as before. So, the substituent is a group that has a CH group, a couple of CH2 groups, and some methyl groups.

Assuming X is an aromatic aldehyde with a substituent, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and the same substituent, which would be a para-xylene derivative with a CH2 group and a substituent.

But looking at the options, none of them are alkanes. The options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzenes.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Maybe the reaction of X (an aldehyde) with red phosphorus and HI reduces the aldehyde to a methylene group, but then another reaction happens, like elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the product is an alcohol. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce carbonyl groups to methylene groups. So, any carbonyl in X would be reduced to CH2.

If X is a ketone with a substituent, the product would be the corresponding alkane. For example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone (Ph-CO-CH2-sec-butyl), then upon reduction, it would become Ph-CH2-CH2-sec-butyl), but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, the product is a benzene ring with isobutyl and methyl groups in the para positions.

If the product is option B, then X must have been a ketone that upon reduction becomes a methyl group. So, X would have been 4-methyl-1-(isobutyl)benzophenone. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone with a substituent that, upon reduction, becomes a methyl group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent that, when reduced, becomes a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that, upon reduction, becomes a methylene group.

But without knowing X, it's difficult to see.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent in X. The substituent's NMR signals suggest a chain of -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

If X is a benzaldehyde with this substituent, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and the same substituent.

But it's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the IR and NMR data fit a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent.

But earlier, the NMR's 10.5 ppm doesn't fit a carboxylic acid, as it should be a broad peak around 12 ppm. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 is a singlet, which might not be the O-H. Oh wait, perhaps the 10.5 is the aldehyde proton. So X is an aromatic aldehyde, and the O-H (from the aldehyde) would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm, which fits.

Then, the reaction would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group, giving a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a substituent. But the options don't include such a structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is also part of the reduction. For example, if the substituent is a ketone, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to make a decision based on the data.

The IR and NMR data suggest X has a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), possibly an aldehyde or ketone.

The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is likely an aldehyde proton.

The aromatic protons are para-disubstituted.

The substituent's NMR suggests a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group.

So, X is likely 4-(something)benzaldehyde.

Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde is reduced to CH2.

So, the product would be 4-(something)toluene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So the product would have a methyl group (from the reduced aldehyde) and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So, X was 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

But wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde would have a structure where the benzaldehyde has a substituent in the para position. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the NMR would have:

- Benzaldehyde's aldehyde proton at around 9-10 ppm.

- The substituent's protons as before.

But in the given NMR, the substituent's protons are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

Thus, X is 4-sec-butylbenzaldehyde.

Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde is reduced to a CH2 group, and the substituent remains. So, the product is 4-sec-butyltoluene, which is option D.

Yes, that makes sense.


The question involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data for X suggest it is an aromatic aldehyde with a para-substituted benzene ring and a carbonyl group. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl, and the NMR signal at 10.5 ppm (singlet, 1H) corresponds to an aldehyde proton. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

The substituent on the benzene ring is analyzed based on the NMR signals:
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely a methine proton (CH) adjacent to other groups.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A methylene proton (CH₂) adjacent to the CH group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A methyl group (CH₃) attached to the CH group.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A terminal methyl group (CH₃) in a longer chain.

This substituent corresponds to a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-). Thus, X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde**.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂). The substituent on the benzene ring remains unchanged. Therefore, the product is **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**, which corresponds to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**

Answer: D
