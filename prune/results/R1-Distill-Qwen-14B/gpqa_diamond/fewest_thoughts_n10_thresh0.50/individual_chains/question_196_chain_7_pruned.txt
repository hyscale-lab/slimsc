Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass is attached to a spring and experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is simple harmonic motion, but this is relativistic, which probably means I need to consider effects from Einstein's theory of relativity.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The options are A to D, each with a different expression involving c (speed of light), k, A, m, and possibly other constants.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so option C might not be the correct answer here.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I think I need to use the relativistic expressions for energy. In special relativity, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved
