Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks given are 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The big peaks around 3400 suggest there might be an -OH group or some kind of stretching like an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring. 

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR is as follows: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

The 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet and broad, which makes me think of an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton, but that's less common. Since the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is often a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. In that case, the 10.5 ppm would be the acidic -OH proton. 

The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene. So the structure likely has a substituent in the para position.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If it's para, then the two aromatic protons on one side would be adjacent to the substituent, and their chemical shifts would be downfield. The other two would be more shielded. But in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm is d (2H) and 7.2 is also d (2H), so that fits with para substitution. So the aromatic ring has a group attached to carbon 1 and another group to carbon 4? Or maybe the substituent is in position 4 and another in position 1? Or perhaps just one substituent in a position that causes those shifts.

Wait, but wait. For a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents, like 1,4-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene), the protons would be split into two doublets if there are two substituents. So in this case, maybe the substituents are at 1 and 4 positions, but in this case, the substituent might be a group that causes such a splitting.

Wait, but the substituent could be a single group that is branched. For example, a group like isobutyl or something. Let me think about the other parts of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That's a bit downfield, but not too bad. Maybe a CH next to an electron-withdrawing group. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, and 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H. 

Looking at the 1.4 and 0.9 ppm signals: 1.4 is a doublet integrating for 3H, which is typical of a CH3 group attached to a CH2, like in an isobutyl group. The 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3 in a longer chain, like an ethyl group. So maybe the structure has an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, putting this together. Let's think about the possible structure. The aromatic ring has substituents. One substituent might be a carbonyl group (from the IR's 1720 cm-1 peak) if it's a ketone or ester. Or maybe a carboxylic acid group. Let's think. If the IR has a strong peak around 1720, that's a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but can be higher. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm would fit with a carboxylic acid -OH.

So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 probably from the COOH group. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests substituents in the para positions. Wait, but benzoic acid would have the COOH group in the para position relative to another substituent. So maybe the structure is something like 4-substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, let's look at the other parts. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to a carbonyl. Like maybe a CH2COOH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two more CH2 groups. The
