Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transits. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, in this question, I think the planets have already been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so maybe that gives us some more data.

The question says both planets have the same mass. Oh, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter a period than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since shorter period means closer orbit, right? Because according to Kepler's third law, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed over the mass of the star. So if the period is shorter, the planet is closer in.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger. I think more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's expanding a bit but the radius is same as Planet_1's host. So R1 = R2.

Wait, the probability of transit depends on the relative sizes of the planet and the star. But wait, when you have a planet with a smaller star, the transit probability is higher because the planet is a larger fraction of the star
