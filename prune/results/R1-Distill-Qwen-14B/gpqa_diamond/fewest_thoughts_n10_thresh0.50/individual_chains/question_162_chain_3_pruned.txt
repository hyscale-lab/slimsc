Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit shaky on the exact details.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so that looks like a line element in two dimensions. Usually, the area element in 2D is just dx dy, but this metric is scaled by a factor. I think the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is 2D and the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy².

Wait, the metric is written as ds² equals a function times (dx² + dy²). So, the function is (32)/(4 - x² - y²). Oh right, so the coefficients for dx² and dy² are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², but wait, no. Wait, determinant for a diagonal metric is (g_xx * g_yy). Since both are the same, it's [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

But wait, no. Wait, the metric is diagonal with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So determinant is their product, which is (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. Hmm, so the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt of [ (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2 ] multiplied by dx dy. That simplifies to 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(g) is sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²))² ) which is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate dA over the region where the metric is valid. The metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, so 4 - x² - y² = 0 => x² + y² = 4. So the region is the interior of the circle with radius 2
