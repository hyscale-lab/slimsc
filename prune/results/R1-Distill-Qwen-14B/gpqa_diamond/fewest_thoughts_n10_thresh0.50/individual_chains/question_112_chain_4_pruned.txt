Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. Hmm, the question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, and some probabilities and expectation values for a specific operator.

Alright, let's break it down. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. Since the problem says |alpha> is proportional, I think I can normalize it first.

So, the first step is to normalize the state. To do that, I'll calculate the norm of the given vector. The norm squared is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's compute their magnitudes:

For (1+i), the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So, magnitude squared is 2.

For (2-i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). Magnitude squared is 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem mentions an operator whose matrix representation A has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, what's the size of this matrix? Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the state is two-dimensional (|up> and |down>). So the matrix is 2x2.

Let me write down matrix A. For a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:

A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1)
A_12 = hbar/2
A_21 = hbar/2
A_22 = 0

So the matrix looks like:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Hmm, wait a second. That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0 1], [1 0]], so yeah, A is (hbar/2) times X.

But wait, maybe I should think about what operator this is. The Pauli matrices are related to spin components. Oh right, the spin operator in the x-direction is (hbar/2) σ_x. So operator A is the spin-x operator.

So, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates for σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So when we measure A, which is S_x, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of A would be ±hbar/2, because the eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so when multiplied by hbar/2, they become ±hbar/2.

Wait, but when we measure
