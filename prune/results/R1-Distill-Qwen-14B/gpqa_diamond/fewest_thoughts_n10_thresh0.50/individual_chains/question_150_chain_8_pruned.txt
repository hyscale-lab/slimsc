Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR questions and reaction mechanisms. But I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the product after a series of reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2=9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I messed up the formula. The correct formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO:

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds, or multiple rings, etc.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group here.
- 6.98 (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe aromatic protons, ortho to a substituent.
- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe para to something else. So perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, like two para-substituted phenyl groups?
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe two protons—could be an enol or something with exchange, like an -OH group? Or maybe adjacent to an electronegative group.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for two protons. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something, like an oxygen or a carbonyl.

Putting this together: Maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde part, with some substituents. Wait, but the molecular formula has 8 carbons. Let's see. If it's benzaldehyde (C7H6O), but the formula here is C8H9NO. So maybe there's another group attached.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72. Aldehyde protons are usually singlets, but if it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled to another proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't couple much, unless it's something like a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an aldehyde but another type of proton. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The triplet at 9.72 could be an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl group. Like an enal. The coupling would be
