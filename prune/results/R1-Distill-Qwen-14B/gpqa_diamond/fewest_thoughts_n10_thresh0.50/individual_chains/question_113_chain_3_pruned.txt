Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or something like that. Wait, wait, 1650 could also be an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that.

So, the presence of a carbonyl group is likely. But why two? Hmm. Maybe two different types of carbonyls? Or perhaps a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester and a ketone, or maybe a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl and an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones adjacent to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. So the structure must have at least one double bond. Maybe it's an ester with a double bond nearby, or perhaps it's a ketone and an alkene.

Now, the mass spectrometry part: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? I remember that a common fragment is the CH3CO (acetate) group, which is 45 (since CH3CO+ is 45). Or maybe another group. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (acetic acid is 60, but wait, no, the acetate ion is 45, so maybe that's what it is). Alternatively, a methyl ester or something. Another possibility is that the fragment is an ethylene group, but I'm not sure. Wait, the molecular ion might lose some groups. So if the molecular formula is something like C6H10O2, perhaps the fragment losing two carbons and some oxygens?

Wait, let me think about the molecular formulas given. Let's list them:

A) C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O. (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C) C
