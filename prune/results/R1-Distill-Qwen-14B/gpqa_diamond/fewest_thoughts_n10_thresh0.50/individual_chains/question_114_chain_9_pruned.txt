Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

So the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with CN- in certain conditions, it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins. So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of CN- to a ketone. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen attacks the CN-, making a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the proton is added. But wait, in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide would add HCN effectively across the carbonyl group. So the product after adding HCN would have an OH group and a CN group on the same carbon. So, structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Yes.

So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The conditions for this usually involve an acid catalyst. Because the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate is more favorable under acidic conditions. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or maybe H2SO4 or something else. Looking at the options, A is H3O+ for some options. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ or maybe NaHSO3. Wait, what's the role of NaHSO3? Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility for the first reaction: Maybe it's not a direct addition. Could it be something else? Oh wait, but the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group on the same carbon. So yeah, that's definitely a cyanohydrin. So the reagents are a ketone and NaCN with an acid catalyst.

So for the first reagent A, it's probably H
