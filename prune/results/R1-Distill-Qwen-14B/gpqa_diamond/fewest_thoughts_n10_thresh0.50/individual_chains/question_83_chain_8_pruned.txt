Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read through it again. We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have the Ka of acetic acid as 1.85x10^-5.

First, I need to find out what happens during the titration. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, they form acetate ions (the conjugate base) and water.

Let me jot down what I know. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

So, the initial step is to dilute the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the new volume is 40 cm³.

Dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 = (M1 V1) / V2.

M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M?

Wait, 20 times 0.05 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when you titrate, the volume of the solution will change as you add NaOH. But initially, before any titration, the solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me recall what 25% titration means. That is, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the point where 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted.

First, let's find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially present.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. Wait, 20+20=40 cm³, which is 0.04 L.

Wait, no. Wait. No, wait: the initial volume before titration is 40 cm³ (20+20), yes. So initial moles of acetic acid is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So equivalence point requires 0.001 mol of NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH needed is (0.001 mol)/(0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, that's the 25% point.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH at 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.0002
