Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different capabilities. The question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, the key here is apparent magnitude. A star's apparent magnitude determines how bright it appears from Earth, so if a star is brighter than a certain magnitude, it's detectable by the instrument.

Wait, but for each star, I need to calculate their apparent magnitude because some might have absolute magnitudes or other factors affecting their apparent brightness. Oh right, the question provides some stars with apparent magnitude already, others with absolute magnitude and distance, and some with extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent brightness.

Let me list each star and figure out their apparent V magnitude.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude: 15.5
- Distance: 10 pc
- So, apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log (d/10)
d is 10 pc, so log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So m =15.5 +0 =15.5 mag.

Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5. ESPRESSO can see down to 17, so 15.5 is brighter than that. HIRES can see down to 16, so 15.5 is also brighter. So both can detect Star1. But wait, I need to check if the star is observable by both. But let's see the other stars.

Star2:
- Apparent V mag: 16.5
- Distance: 5 pc. Hmm, wait, no—apparent magnitude is given, so I don't need to calculate it. So m=16.5.

ESPRESSO requires m ≤17, so 16.5 is okay. HIRES requires m ≤16, so 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't detect Star2. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO. So for the options, any that include Star2 would be incorrect.

Star3:
- Apparent V mag: 15.5
- But wait, E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, so there's extinction. The question says that the total absorption in V is related with E(B-V) by a coefficient of 3.1. So extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0, and the observed m is m0 + A_V. Wait wait, no: if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the apparent magnitude is larger (since it's fainter). So the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction is m0, but because of extinction, it's observed as m = m0 + A_V.

Wait, but
