Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given for each component: P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So first, I need to understand the operator P. Oh wait, wait. The operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, meaning ny is zero.

I remember that the spin operator for a spin-½ particle in an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the direction vector. So the operator P should be something like P = (P_x nx + P_z nz) multiplied by ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given for the operator along n, so we're dealing with the spin in that direction.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? And the spin operator S for a spin-½ particle is (ħ/2) * σ · n, where n is the direction. So in this case, I think the operator in question is similar but maybe for a different system, like the momentum operator? Or wait, wait, the question says it's a quantum mechanical operator vector P. So each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.

So to find the eigenvector of P along n, I need to construct the operator P along direction n. Since n is in x-z plane, the operator will be a combination of P_x and P_z.

So let's write down the matrices for each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator P along direction n is P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, so ny=0.

So substituting,
