Okay, I need to figure out the value of 'a' in the given wave function. Let's see.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd. Typically, a wave function would be a complex number, so having a real and imaginary part makes sense. But in this case, the function is written as (a divided by sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from all space must equal 1. Because the wave function must be normalized.

The problem states that when they measured the particles, they were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside of this region. Or wait, no. The measurement results show that particles are present only between 1 and 3, which suggests that the wave function is non-zero only in this interval. So the wave function is zero elsewhere, but according to the given expression, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that doesn't seem to be zero outside 1 and 3. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps that's the form of the wave function in
