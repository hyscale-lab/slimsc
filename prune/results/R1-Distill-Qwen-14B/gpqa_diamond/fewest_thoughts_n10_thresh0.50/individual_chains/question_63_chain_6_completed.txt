Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to absorb a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state, and the next state could be a higher vibrational state or a rotational transition within the same vibrational level.

Wait, but the question specifies it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that implies the smallest possible energy increase. That would mean promoting the molecule from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1), since that's a Δv = +1 transition. Because rotation and vibration have different energy scales, vibrations are higher energy, so the photon needed for a vibrational transition would have higher energy than a rotational one.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, momentum of a photon is related to its energy. The energy of a photon is E = hν, and the momentum p is E/c, since p = E/c for photons. So p = hν/c.

But wait, the problem gives the angular frequency ω, not the frequency ν. Oh, right, ω is 2πν, so ν = ω/(2π). So I can calculate ν from that.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go step by step. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which for rotation-vibration is v=0, and the lowest rotational state (like J=0). To go to the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think that would be the next vibrational state, v=1, but with the lowest rotational state possible in that vibrational level. Alternatively, could it be a change in both rotation and vibration? Hmm, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the lowest energy state higher than the current state is either the next vibrational level (since that's a higher energy jump) or perhaps the next rotational state within the same vibrational level.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which includes both the lowest vibrational (v=0) and the lowest rotational (J=0) state. So the next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these requires less energy?

Vibrational energy levels have much larger spacing than rotational. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) hω. So the energy to go from v=0 to v=1 is hω/2. Rotational energy is E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing from J=0 to J=1 would be from (0 +1) to (1*(2)) ... wait, let's compute it. For J=0, E_J = (0)(1) ħ²/(2I) which is 0. For J=1, it's (1*2) ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). 

So the energy difference for rotation would be the E_J for J=1 minus J=0: (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 (since J=1 is 2, J=0 is 0). Wait, no, the formula is E_J = [J (J+1) ] * (ħ² / (2I)). So when J=0, E_J is 0. For J=1, E_J is (1*2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2 ħ² )/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ħ²/(I). 

Compare that with the vibrational transition ΔE_vibr = h ω /2.

Which is smaller? It depends on the values. Let me calculate both.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? It's the smallest possible energy increase, so whichever transition requires less energy.

So I need to find which is smaller: the rotational transition within the same vibrational level or the vibrational transition.

Hmm, alternatively, the molecule could change both vibration and rotation. Like, go to v=1 and J=0. But that would require more energy than just a pure vibrational or pure rotational transition.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal ΔE would be either the smallest rotational step or the vibrational step.

But wait, in the pure rotational case, the energy is much less than the vibrational. Because the vibrational frequency is typically higher. Let me think about the numbers.

Given that the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The vibrational frequency ν = ω/(2π) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

The energy for the vibrational transition is hν. Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So E_vibr = h * ν = 6.626e-34 * 6.37e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

What about the rotational transition? Let's compute the moment of inertia I. I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

The masses are X: 20 amu, Y: 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y) ) * u, where u is the atomic mass unit. 

Wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) ) * u = (40/22) * u ≈ (18/11) * 1.66e-27 kg? Wait, 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then, the energy difference for rotation is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) * (J+1) ? No, wait, the transition from J=0 to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

So ħ is h/(2π), about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J²·s².

Then, ΔE_rot = (1.1e-68) / (1.2e-46) ) ≈ 9.17e-23 J. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 is (1.1/1.2)*1e(-68+46)= ~0.9e-22 J, which is about 9e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier, the vibrational energy was 4.2e-20 J, which is much larger than 9e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the minimal energy change is the rotational transition.

But wait, is the molecule allowed to transition only within the same vibrational state? Because in the pure rotation case, the rotational transitions are usually dipole allowed when the molecule has a permanent dipole moment. But the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), which I think implies that both vibrational and rotational states are considered, but selection rules apply.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But in the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the model is more complex, but I'm not sure. But for the purpose of this question, perhaps we can consider that moving from J=0 to J=1 is allowed.

So in that case, the molecule could undergo a rotational transition, which requires less energy than a vibrational transition. Therefore, the minimal energy photon needed is the one that causes the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

So the momentum of the photon is p = E/c, where E is the energy of the photon. Since the photon's energy is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = 9.17e-23 J (from earlier calculation?), wait, wait, no, let me recompute that.

Wait, earlier, I calculated ΔE_rot as approximately 9.17e-23 J. Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute μ:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * u = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.81818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ * r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) ? Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that ΔE_rot is ħ²/(I). So let me recalculate.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ²/(2I)).

So for J=0 → E_J=0 is 0.

For J=1 → E_J=1 = (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) ) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ħ²/(I).

So with the numbers:

ħ²/(I) = (1.112e-68) / (1.208e-46) = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e(-68 +46) = approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon should be about 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, I thought the rotational energy is much less than the vibrational. Let me confirm the vibrational energy. The vibrational energy difference is from v=0 to v=1, which is hω/2? Or is it hν?

Wait, the energy levels for vibration are E_v = (v + 1/2) hω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is hω.

Wait, no, wait, the energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) hω. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is E_1 - E_0 = hω (1 + 1/2) - hω (0 + 1/2) ) = hω ( (3/2) - (1/2) ) ) = hω (1) ) = hω.

So the photon's energy would need to be hω.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon_vibrational = hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is much larger than the rotational energy of 9.2e-23 J. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, can the molecule make a transition from J=0 to J=1 while being in the same vibrational state? I think that's allowed, depending on the selection rules. I remember that in pure rotational spectra, ΔJ = ±1, but in a diatomic with a permanent dipole moment, those transitions are allowed. So if the molecule is in the v=0 state, J=0, it can absorb a photon to go to J=1, while staying in v=0.

So the question is, what's the momentum of the photon that causes this transition. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, and since p = E/c, we can calculate that.

c is speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s.

So p = E / c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = (9.2 /3) * 1e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, because 1 N·s is equal to 1 kg·m/s. So the momentum I calculated is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s. But none of the options are that low. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, let me go back.

The formula for the rotational energy is E_J = [ J (J + 1) ] * (ħ²/(2I) )

So for J=0: E_J=0 = 0.

For J=1: E_J=1 = (1 * 2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I)

So yes, the energy difference is ħ²/(I).

Wait, but perhaps the reduced mass μ is incorrect? Let me recalculate μ.

Mass of X: 20 amu, Y: 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * u

= (40)/(22) * u

= (20/11) * u

u is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

That seems correct.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then, (ħ)^2 is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 = approximately 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So the energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, none of these are near 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Maybe the molecule transitions not just to the next rotational state but also to the next vibrational state. Because if it's in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), perhaps the next state is v=1, J=0. Because that would require more energy than a rotational transition, but perhaps it's the next state in the overall energy ordering.

Wait, but that would require a photon with higher energy. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy jump is the rotational one, but perhaps the question expects the vibrational transition instead.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state is v=0, J=1, which has higher energy than v=1, J=0. Wait no, let me think about the actual energy levels.

The vibrational energy is much higher than the rotational. So the ordering might be v=0, J=1 (higher than J=0) is lower energy than v=1, J=0. So the next state would be v=0, J=1. So that's the minimal energy transition.

But according to my calculation, that requires a photon with E=9.2e-23 J, which is 9.2e-23 J, but converting into momentum:

p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.067e-31 kg·m/s = 3.067e-31 N·s.

But the options are in the 1e-28 to 1e-27 range. My answer is way smaller than any of the options.

Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should instead compute the vibrational transition, which would give a higher momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, but the next state is the first vibrational excited state, regardless of rotation. So the photon must provide the energy for the vibrational transition, which is h ω.

Because if the molecule is in the fundamental (v=0) state, the next state with the lowest energy would be v=1, but with the same J=0. Because the rotational energy is much lower, but perhaps the question is implying that the transition is purely vibrational. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h ω = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options: option A is 1.9e-28, which is close, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used ν instead of ω.

Wait, because ω = 2π ν. So if we have ω=4e14 rad/s, then ν = ω/(2π) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon = h ν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = approx 4.22e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 N·s.

That's about 1.4e-28, which matches option D.

Wait, but in this case, the photon's momentum is 1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

So why is this conflicting with the earlier conclusion about the minimal energy transition being rotational?

Ah, because perhaps the question is considering that the molecule cannot change both its vibrational and rotational state at the same time. Or perhaps the question is referring to the molecule transitioning to the next energy level, regardless of which mode it's in.

Wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the minimal energy increase would be the rotational transition, but if that's not among the options, perhaps I'm wrong in that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, not the next rotational state.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible transitions. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The fundamental state is the lowest, which is v=0, J=0.

The next energy states would be:

1. v=0, J=1 (rotational)
2. v=1, J=0 (vibrational)
3. v=1, J=1 (vibrational + rotational)
4. etc.

So the energy order would have v=0, J=1 being lower than v=1, J=0. Because the vibrational energy is much higher than rotational. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is v=0, J=1.

So the energy difference for that transition is the rotational energy difference, which is about 9.2e-23 J, leading to a photon momentum of 3e-31 Ns, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the rotational energy is [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ^2/(2I)).

Wait, if J=0 to J=1, then ΔE = E_J=1 - E_J=0.

E_J=0: 0.

E_J=1: (1)(2) * (ħ²/(2I)) )= 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So yes, the same as before. So the energy is correct.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which would have a photon momentum of about 1.4e-28 Ns (option D). But why would that be the case if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but can't make a rotational transition, so the next possible state is the next vibrational state. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition is lower energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the μ and I calculation.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * u = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

So I is correct.

Then, ħ^2/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112e-68) / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum would be (9.2e-23) / (3e8) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me read the question again.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the fundamental state is the lowest, the next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which is either the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. Which requires less energy?

The rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's momentum would be as I calculated, but that doesn't match any option. So perhaps the question is actually about a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational energy at all, but considering that the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which might imply that the bond length is variable, but I'm not sure how that affects the photon's momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of the photon that causes a transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's more complicated and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) to the next vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation. So the energy difference is hω, and the photon's momentum is p = hω/(c).

Wait, hω is 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. Neither is close to 8.8e-28.

Wait, perhaps I should have used ν instead of ω. Because ν = ω/(2π) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

E_photon = hν = 6.626e-34 * 6.37e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

So perhaps the question is expecting the photon's momentum for a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

But why? Because the rotational transition is a lower energy and thus the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotational and vibrational aspects, but I'm not sure how that affects the transition.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model considers that the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the bond length is given, and the calculation is based on that.

Wait, the question gives the bond length as 2 angstroms, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length is variable, but perhaps the calculation uses the given bond length. So I think the initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the energy for the vibrational transition, compute the photon's momentum, and see which option it aligns with.

As I did earlier, that gives 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier reasoning suggests that the rotational transition is lower energy, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

Wait, the rotational energy difference is ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.208e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (1.208e-46) ) = approx 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy is (ħ²/(2I)) * [J(J+1)].

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2 * ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I), which is the same as before.

So the calculation seems correct. So why is there a discrepancy with the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the photon's momentum that would cause a transition to the next vibrational state, regardless of rotational state.

So in that case, p = hν /c = (hω/(2π)) /c.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation using the vibrational frequency, not the rotational.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum based on the vibrational frequency. So let's proceed.

Given ω = 4e14 rad/s,

ν = ω/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

E_photon = h ν = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why did my earlier reasoning suggest that the rotational transition is lower energy?

Ah, perhaps because I forgot that the question is about the momentum, which is just p = E/c, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. But if the rotational transition is the correct one, then the answer would not be any of the options, but the question expects us to calculate the vibrational transition.

Wait, maybe the question is not considering rotation but only vibration. The question says "can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)". Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is a model that includes both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either rotational or vibrational. But the rotational energy difference is smaller than the vibrational.

But the options don't include that, so perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Maybe I should recheck the formula.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

So for J=0, E_J=0 =0.

For J=1, E_J=1 = (2 ħ² )/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = 9.2e-23 J.

p_photon = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that low.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state, regardless of rotation.

So the energy needed would be h ω /2? No, no, E_vibr = (v + 1/2) h ω. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would require h ω.

So E_photon = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

That's option A (1.9e-28) is smaller, but not close. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0 to v=0, J=1.

In that case, the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

But this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first rotational state within the same vibrational level. But that still leads to p=3e-31 Ns.

But since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recompute it.

Wait, let's recompute I.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * u = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40/22 is 1.81818..., so μ ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Compute ħ²/(I):

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = 9.2e-23 J.

So that's correct.

p_photon = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

No match with options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns (option D). So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Maybe the question expects only the vibrational transition, perhaps because it's the next state in terms of the vibrational state, not considering rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition from v=0 to v=1, which requires a photon with higher energy.

But I'm stuck because the calculation suggests the rotational transition is lower energy and should be the next state.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the ω value. The angular frequency given is 4e14 rad/s. But sometimes, in vibrational calculations, the frequency is given as ν, not ω.

Wait, if the question gave ν instead of ω, then the calculation would be different. But the question clearly states ω = 4e14 rad/s.

Hmm, I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the options provided, the only one that matches the vibrational transition is option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. So I'll go with that.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences associated with rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_X = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_Y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_X \cdot M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} \cdot u = \frac{40}{22} \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
  \]

- **Angular frequency of vibration**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1)**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_J = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]  
   For \( J=0 \), \( E_J = 0 \). For \( J=1 \),  
   \[
   E_J = \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot \hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]  
   The energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting the question does not consider rotational transitions.

2. **Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1)**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega.
   \]  
   The energy difference for \( v=0 \to v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibr}} = h \omega.
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibr}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibr}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is also not among the options, so we recompute using the vibrational frequency \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \):  
   \[
   \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]  
   The energy of the photon is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibr}} = h \nu = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.37 \times 10^{13} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibr}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The question likely expects the photon momentum for the vibrational transition, as the options do not align with the rotational transition calculation. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
