Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees.

Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using a formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. For a general crystal system, especially in a cubic system, the formula is something like d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's only for cubic systems, right? Because in cubic systems, the unit cell is a cube, so a = b = c, and the angles are all 90 degrees.

But wait, this crystal is rhombohedral. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, but the angles might not be 90 degrees. Oh, but in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. So, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been deformed so all angles are the same but not 90 degrees.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distances in non-cubic systems is a bit more complicated. I think it's given by the formula 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos β)/(a²) (some term) + ... Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is derived from the general formula for any crystal system. The general formula for interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin α sin β cos γ)) + ... Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I should think about the structure factor formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, but in this case, the Miller indices are (111). So h
