Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying a compound X and figuring out what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The options are given as A to D. 

First, let's look at the data provided. There's IR and 1H NMR data for compound X. I remember that IR can tell us about functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure, like the number of protons and their environments.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That region often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, they don't seem to have amines, so maybe it's an O-H, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but another peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests a carbonyl group, which is present in things like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. Also, the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a high chemical shift. I remember that carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm and show up as broad signals because they're exchangeable. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but aldehyde is a bit lower. So this is more likely a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are in the aromatic region. A doublet each, integrating to 2H each. That suggests a para-substituted benzene, because the two sets of doublets are likely the two protons adjacent to each substituent in a para arrangement. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions.

The 10.
