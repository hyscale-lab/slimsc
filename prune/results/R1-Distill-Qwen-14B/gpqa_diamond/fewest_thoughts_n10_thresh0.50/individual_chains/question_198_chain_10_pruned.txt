Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, so the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^m+? I think the stability constant, β, is for the formation of the complex from the ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^, [Co(SCN)3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)4]^3-. Or maybe I should check how the charge works out. Let's think: Co^2+ with SCN^-.

Each SCN contributes a charge of -1. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, the charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. For [Co(SCN)2]^0: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0, so neutral. Wait, but that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the complexes have varying charges. Hmm, but maybe the charge isn't as important for this calculation. Let's focus on the stability constants.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is [Co(SCN)2]^0. So n=2. So we're looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)2]^0 relative to all cobalt species.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up, then find what fraction is the dithiocyanato one.

The general approach is to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex. The Co^2+ can form various complexes with SCN^-.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the formation constants. The fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- ions is given by (β_n * [SCN
