Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stars, it's related to the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, maybe that's the delta E between the two levels. So for the same element, the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) might be the same, or maybe they are different? Oh wait, since the question says the excitation level is twice, I think we can assume that the ratio of populations is n1/n2 = 2. Because star_1 has twice as many atoms in that excited state compared to star_2.

So the ratio of the populations (n_i/n_j) would be 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2 maybe? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The problem says star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So if n_i is the excited state, then n_i for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So the ratio (n_i1)/(n_i2) = 2.

But wait, I think we should compare each star's situation. Each star has its own temperature, so for each, the ratio would be their own. Let me write the equations.

For star_1: (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n_i')/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, are they in the same ground state (n_j)? Maybe. So if for star_1, n_i is the excited level, and n_j is the lower level. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio. Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. Let's say in star_1, the population in the excited level is twice as much as star_2's population in the same level. So like, n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be that the ratio (n_i/n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, perhaps that's the right approach.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star_2. So maybe the ratio (n_i1 / n_j1) is twice (n_i2 / n_j2). Because each star has its own ratio based on their temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to some reference state is considered. Let's assume that the lower state is the same for both, so n_j is the same for both
