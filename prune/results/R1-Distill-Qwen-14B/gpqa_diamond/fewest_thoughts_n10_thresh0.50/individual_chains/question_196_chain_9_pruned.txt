Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator usually obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so we have to consider the effects of relativity on the motion. 

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, each with a different expression. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think carefully.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So the maximum speed would be when that's equal to (1/2)mv². Solving for v_max gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic case. So we can't just use the classical formula.

Right, in relativity, as speed approaches the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but a harmonic oscillator in relativity—how does it work? In the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't the same as the classical case. I think the potential energy for a relativistic oscillator might involve a term that depends on velocity or another factor. Or maybe the equation of motion is modified.

Wait, perhaps the oscillator's equation in relativity is different. Let me think. The force is F = -kx, but the mass is relativistic. So the equation of motion would be more complicated. The relativistic equation for a harmonic oscillator isn't the same as the classical one. 

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is conserved. But relativistically, maybe the energy isn't the same because the mass increases with velocity. Hmm, but wait, the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) is conserved.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy is quantized in a different way, but that's probably beyond what's needed here. The problem is about the maximum speed, so maybe I should think about when the potential energy is maximum and the kinetic energy is maximum.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, potential energy is maximum at the extremes (
