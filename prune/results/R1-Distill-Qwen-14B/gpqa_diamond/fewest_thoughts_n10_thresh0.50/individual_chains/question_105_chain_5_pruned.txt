Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the observed brightness changes, which can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking what radius an exoplanet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets measures the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the formula for the relative brightness change (ΔF) is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, it's not just a single spot but a hemisphere covered with spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is occupied by spots. So each spot's area is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the hemisphere's area is (4πR²)/2, right? Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is half that, 2πR². So each spot covers 0.2 * 2πR²? Or wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere, so each spot is 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

But wait, a hemisphere is a spherical cap, and each spot is a part of that. So when the star rotates and we see the spots come into view, the change in brightness is due to the difference in temperature between the spotted and non-spotted regions.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. So when a spot
