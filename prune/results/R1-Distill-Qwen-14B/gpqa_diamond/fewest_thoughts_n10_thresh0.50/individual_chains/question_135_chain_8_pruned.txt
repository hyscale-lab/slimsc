Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the possible decays of a boson X. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, probably it's L = λ f f-bar ψ(y) X(y) ψ_f(y), because the v might be a constant or vacuum expectation value, but for decay processes, the v might not contribute since X is the field we're considering.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when thinking about its decay products, I have to consider the available energy. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so any decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

The decay products have to be fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term is between X and fermions. So X can decay into pairs like quarks, leptons, etc.

Now, the key is to determine which fermions have a mass such that twice their mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion in the pair has mass m, so the pair requires 2m.

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up and down quarks: around 2-5 MeV each. So 2m is about 4-10 MeV. Well below 6 GeV.

- Strange quark: about 100 MeV. 2m is ~200 MeV. Also way below.

- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV. So 2m is ~3 GeV. That's under 6 GeV.

- Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. 2m would be ~9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because that would require 9 GeV, which X doesn't have.

- Top quark is way heavier, like 173 GeV, so definitely can't decay into t quarks.

For leptons:

- Electron is about 0.
