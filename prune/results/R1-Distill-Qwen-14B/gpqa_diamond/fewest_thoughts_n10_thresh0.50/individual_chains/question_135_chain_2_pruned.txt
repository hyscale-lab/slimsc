Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about particle physics and decay processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a bosonic field X and its interaction with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I got that right. Oh wait, the correct expression is probably something like L = λ ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Maybe it's written with a Yukawa coupling kind of term. So the boson X interacts with fermions via this term, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So what particles can X decay into?

I remember that for a particle to decay into another pair of particles, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the daughter particles. Also, the decay has to conserve charge and other quantum numbers.

So, first, let me think about the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. The Lagrangian term suggests that X couples to fermions. The term in the Lagrangian is something like X ψ_f ψ_f. Wait, actually, the term would be something like X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that X couples to a pair of identical fermions. Because the Lagrangian term is something like λ X ψ ψ.

So X is a boson (probably a scalar) that couples to two fermions of the same type. So the decay would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion species.

Wait, but wait. The term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Oh, sorry, that LaTeX code is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The Lagrangian is written as:

mathcal{L}(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and should be ψ instead of ψ_f? Or maybe it's supposed to be ψ_f and ψ_f? Hmm, perhaps the term is something like X ψ ψ, so the coupling is between X and two fermions ψ.

In any case, the interaction is between X and fermions. So each decay would involve X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the maximum mass each daughter fermion can have is 3 GeV, because each would need to be at least half the mass of X to produce a pair.

Wait, but wait. If X is 6 GeV, then each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV → way below 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV → also way below.
- Tau (τ): ~1
