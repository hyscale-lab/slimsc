Okay, I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The given concentrations are c(Co) total is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the complexes look like. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) in different stoichiometries. The blue complexes are probably the ones with more SCN- attached, maybe the higher-order ones. Wait, I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_n]^m- complexes. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is a common blue complex.

The stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of each complex. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So, β1 is for the first complex, which is probably [CoSCN]^+ since β1=9. Then β2=40 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something, but wait, I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think: Co^2+ plus n SCN^- gives a complex with charge 2+ - n*(−1) = 2 -n. So, for [CoSCN]^+, n=1: charge is 2+ -1*(-1) = 2+ +1 = 3+? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the formula of the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). Let me think: Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So, the complex charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So, for the first complex, n=1: 2-1= +1. So, [CoSCN]^+. The stability constant β1 is for this complex, so β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ).

Similarly, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because 2-2=0. So neutral. β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- : 2-3= -1. β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-: 2-4= -2.

Wait, but sometimes the order might be different. Oh wait, wait. The β values could be for complexes in order of increasing n. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? Because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ions attached. So that's the second complex, with β2=40.

Wait, but wait. The question says "dithiocyanato" which means two SCN- groups. So that would be [
