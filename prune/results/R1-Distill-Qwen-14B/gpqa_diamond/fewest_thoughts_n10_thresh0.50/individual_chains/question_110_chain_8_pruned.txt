Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and what spectrographs can detect them. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Both are high-resolution spectrographs. The key here is figuring out which stars are bright enough in the V band for both instruments.

Wait, the question gives the info that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star must have V mag ≤16 to be seen by HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be ≤16, because that's the stricter limit. Because if it's brighter than 16, both can see it. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can.

But wait, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO, meaning apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V ≤16.

So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be detected by both. That's the main point.

Now let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Apparent V
