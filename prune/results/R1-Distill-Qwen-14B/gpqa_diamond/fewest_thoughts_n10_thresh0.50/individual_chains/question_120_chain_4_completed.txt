Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with different dependencies on 1/plx raised to a power.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That means as parallax increases, the distance decreases. Because if a star is closer, its parallax is larger.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. So, the number density of stars in space is constant. Let's model this. Let's say the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to that volume. Because density is uniform.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit volume is constant, say n. So if I have a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, the volume is 4π r² dr. The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π r² dr.

But wait, in terms of parallax, since plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So d = 1/plx. So when plx increases, d decreases. So for a given plx, the distance is 1/plx parsecs.

Wait, so I'm trying to find how many stars are there per unit change in plx. So let's imagine we have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. I need the number of stars in this range.

But wait, plx is inversely proportional to distance, so for a given dplx, how does that translate to distance? Let's think in terms of distance. Let's say I have a small change in plx, dplx. The corresponding change in distance, dd, would be d(1/plx) = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, I might need to express this more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd multiplied by the number density n. So that's n*4π d² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substitute d into the equation. So number of stars in this shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, no. Let's be careful with differentiation. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the distance as a function of plx is d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by dplx, the distance changes by dd. Let me find the relation between dd and dplx.

Differentiating d = 1/plx, we get dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the change in distance dd is proportional to -dplx / plx².

But I'm interested in the number of stars per unit plx interval. So to find the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx, I would have to express the number of stars in that range.

So substituting d in terms of plx, the number of stars is N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * |dd|.

Wait, because when plx increases, d decreases. So the shell thickness in distance is |dd| = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting, N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx²), because |dd| is dplx / plx².

Wait wait, no. Because dd is the change in distance, which is - (dplx)/ (plx^2). But the thickness is the absolute value, so |dd| = dplx / plx².

Wait, no: let me clarify. Let's have d = 1/plx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² n dd.

But dd is the change in d, so if plx increases by dplx, then d changes by dd = - (d^2) dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = -d² dplx.

Wait, let's compute dd in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx

dd = derivative of d with respect to plx * dplx
dd = (-1/plx²) dplx

So dd = - (d^2) dplx, because d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx².

Therefore, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with parallax plx, and thickness dplx, is:

N = n * 4π d² * |dd|

Wait, no. Because if plx increases, d decreases. So the shell at a particular d is moving to a lower d as plx increases. But here, we're considering a small range of plx, which corresponds to a small range of d.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars as a function of plx. Let me model it.

The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume of a thin shell at distance d (parallax plx) with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But I want to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But how? So, dd is the change in d. So, when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd = -(1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx is the number of stars per unit dplx. So, to find the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding d range is from d to d - (d dplx / plx²). So the shell's thickness in d is |dd| = d dplx / plx².

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think of the number of stars as a function of plx. Let's say we have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance range is from d =1/plx to d'=1/(plx + dplx). But for small dplx, d' can be approximated as d - (d^2) dplx. Because d =1/plx, so d' =1/(plx + dplx) ≈ [1/plx ] * [1 - (dplx)/(plx) ] when dplx is small.

So the change in d is dd ≈ - (d^2) dplx. So the thickness in d is |dd| = d^2 dplx.

So the number of stars in that thin shell (parallax plx to plx +dplx) is n * 4π d² * |dd|.

Substituting |dd|=d^2 dplx, we get:

N = n *4π d² * d² dplx.

But since d=1/plx, so d² =1/plx². So substituting:

N = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

So N= (4 π n) * (1/plx^4) * dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, per unit dplx, the number is (4 π n) / plx^4.

So that's the number of stars per unit plx interval. So the number decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume per unit distance at distance d is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars per unit distance is 4π n d².

But the stars per unit parallax would require expressing this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, so d=1/plx. So substituting, the number of stars per unit distance is 4π n (1/plx)^2.

But how does the number of stars per unit parallax (d dplx) relate to this?

Wait, perhaps I need to express the number of stars as a function of plx.

The number of stars per unit parallax interval (d dplx) is equal to the number of stars per unit distance (dd) multiplied by the change in distance per change in plx.

So, stars per d dplx is (stars per dd) * (dd / d dplx).

Because if d dplx corresponds to a change in dd, then the number of stars in d dplx is (stars per dd) * (dd / d dplx).

Hmm, not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit plx is stars per unit volume multiplied by the volume per unit plx.

Wait, the volume per unit plx would be the volume between plx and plx + dplx, which is the integral from d=1/(plx + dplx) to d=1/plx of 4 π d² dd.

But for small dplx, we can approximate this as 4 π d² (d d), where d is 1/plx and d d is the change in d, which is approximately (d²) dplx.

So the volume per unit plx is 4 π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. So 4 π / plx^4 dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is n * volume per unit plx, which is n * (4 π) / plx^4.

So that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought I was getting this earlier. So the correct answer would be A. But wait, another way to think about it is considering the solid angle and the distance.

Wait, the solid angle element might not be the issue here because the question states that the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which I think refers to uniform distribution in space, not on the sky. So maybe I should model it in 3D.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume per unit parallax would be the volume between plx and plx+dplx.

But parallax is like a measure of depth. So for a given plx, the stars at that parallax are at distance d=1/plx parsecs.

The number of stars in a thin shell (at distance d) with thickness dr is 4 pi d^2 dr * n.

So the number of stars per unit distance is 4 pi n d^2.

But since plx =1/d, so d=1/plx. So, stars per unit distance is 4 pi n (1/plx)^2.

Now, how does distance change with plx? dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, because d=1/plx → dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is (stars per unit distance) * (dr / dplx).

Wait, no: because when plx increases by dplx, the distance decreases by dr= - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is stars_per_distance * (dr / dplx).

Wait, no, because when you have a thin shell at a certain d, the number of stars in a thin shell is stars_per_distance * dr.

But to find the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., per dplx), you have to express that in terms of dplx.

But dr is in terms of dplx. So, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is stars_per_distance * dr.

But dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, stars_in_shell = 4 pi n (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, the negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering the magnitude, it's 4 pi n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx interval is 4 pi n / plx^4, which again suggests that the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct option would be A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, another thought: In an exam setting, sometimes the formula is known. I recall that the number density in parallax space decreases with 1/plx^3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think differently. The volume per unit parallax would be the shell's volume between plx and plx + dplx.

The volume at distance d is 4 pi d^2 dr. But d=1/plx, so dr is change in d.

But what's the volume between plx and plx + dplx?

Wait, but for a thin shell, the volume is 4 pi d^2 dr, where dr is the change in distance. So, as d=1/plx, dr= - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the volume is 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx =4 pi / plx^4 dplx.

So volume per unit plx is 4 pi / plx^4. Since the number of stars is density times volume, it's n * (4 pi / plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is n *4 pi / plx^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is ~1/plx^4.

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number per unit distance is 1/d^2, so perhaps I'm getting something wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the flux from stars, but no, the question is about the number of stars.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the scaling.

Suppose that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So, the number of stars in a volume V is n * V.

If I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance is from d to d - (d^2) dplx, where d = 1/plx.

The volume between these distances is 4 pi (d^2 + (d - dd)^2)(dd) ≈ 4 pi d^2 * |dd|, because for small dd, the change in d squared is negligible compared to d^2.

Wait, but no, the volume of the shell is 4 pi (d^2) * |dd|, where |dd| is the thickness.

But in terms of plx, |dd| = (d^2) dplx, as before.

So, the volume is 4 pi d^2 * (d^2 dplx) = 4 pi d^4 dplx.

But d=1/plx, so d^4 =1/plx^4.

So volume is 4 pi/(plx^4) dplx.

Thus, number of stars is n * (4 pi)/(plx^4) * dplx.

So the number per unit plx is 4 pi n / plx^4.

Which again points to option A.

So, I think the correct answer is A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left|\frac{dd}{d\text{plx}}\right| d\text{plx} \). The relationship between \( dd \) and \( d\text{plx} \) is derived from \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), giving \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The absolute value of \( dd \) is \( \left|\frac{dd}{d\text{plx}}\right| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).

Substituting this into the volume expression, the number of stars in the shell becomes proportional to:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot d\text{plx} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

This matches option **A**, which states that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Answer: A
