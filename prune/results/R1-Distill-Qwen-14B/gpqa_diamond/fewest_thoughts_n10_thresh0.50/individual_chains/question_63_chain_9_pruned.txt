Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum models. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, specifically the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions between energy levels. The non-rigid rotor model accounts for both rotational and vibrational energy states. Oh wait, the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state for the molecule. So, when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. But I'm not exactly sure what that means in terms of quantum numbers.

Wait, wait. In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * n(n+1), where n is the rotational quantum number. But this is the non-rigid rotor, so maybe there's also a vibrational component. Oh right, the rotation-vibration model includes both rotational and vibrational energies. So the total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational parts.

The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state, which I think is the ground vibrational state with quantum number v=0. For rotation, the fundamental state would be the lowest rotational state, n=0. But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Does that mean it's the combination of both? So the total energy is the sum of the ground state rotational energy and the ground state vibrational energy.

But wait, I'm getting confused. The fundamental state might be the state with the lowest total energy, which would be v=0 and n=0. So the molecule is in v=0, n=0. When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state. The next lowest energy state would probably involve either increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational quantum number.

Wait, the problem says the photon should cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, we need the transition with the smallest possible energy increase. That would probably be the next available state, which could be either increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational. Which transition requires less energy?

I think vibrational transitions typically require higher energy than rotational transitions because the vibrational energy levels are
