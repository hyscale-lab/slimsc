Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's tackle each part step by step.

First, relative speed. When dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, I can't just subtract them normally because that's incorrect in relativity. I remember that the formula for adding velocities relativistically is different. Oh right, it's the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/cÂ² ). Wait, but wait. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, what's their relative speed? Or is it the other way around? Because the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction, so from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, actually, since both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity. So the
