Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Let's start by identifying the possible substances involved.

First, the reaction between X and Y is violent, so it's probably a strong reaction. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. The number of protons and neutrons being the same means the atom is probably a noble gas, because they have stable electron configurations. Let me think: if W is a gas, and the atoms have equal protons and neutrons, the possible candidates could be something like He (which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons), but wait, that's 2 each. But wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, the molecule could be a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2, but that's not matching the same number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, if each atom is carbon-12, but that's possible? Or maybe each atom is something like O-16 where protons = 8, neutrons = 8. But then the molecule would be O2, but each atom contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total for the molecule would be 16 protons and 16 neutrons. But the question says the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for O2, 16 p and 16 n, that works. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is a gas, yes. So Y is a liquid reacting with X to produce O
