Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully.

The question has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think I should tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So when a ketone reacts with CN-, I remember that it's typically a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is probably the same as the formation of a cyanohydrin. Wait, a cyanohydrin is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide to form a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group. So the product here, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, makes sense because the ketone (butan-2-one) adds the CN- across the carbonyl, resulting in both an OH and CN group on the same carbon. But wait, how does that happen?

I think the reaction usually requires an acid catalyst. Oh right, the addition of CN- to ketones is typically done under acidic conditions. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then water leaves, giving the cyanohydrin.

So in the first step, reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B), or maybe something else. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 in some options.

Wait, another possibility is using H2SO4 or another acid. But the options only have H3O+ or NaHSO3 as possible A. So for the first reaction, adding acid (like H3O+) would be the reagent A.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, in the presence of a strong base, maybe the reaction proceeds differently. But
