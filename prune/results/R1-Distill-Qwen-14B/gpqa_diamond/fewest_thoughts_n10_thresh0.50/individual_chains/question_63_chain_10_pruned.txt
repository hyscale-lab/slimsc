Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with quantum models, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, the given data are the masses of the atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The options are all values for momentum p in N*s. 

First, let me recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. I think it's a combination of both rotational and vibrational energy states. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, right? But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, wait. The molecule is in its fundamental state. So, that's probably the state with the lowest rotational and vibrational energy. Oh, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as well. But the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energyâ€”so what's the next state? Oh, right, transitions can be either rotational, vibrational, or a combination. But the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Oh, wait, I think for the rigid rotor, the ground state for rotation is J=0, but in the non-rigid rotor, maybe it's a bit different, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the state with the next higher energy, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait, vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational, right? Because rotational energy levels are closer together. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be a rotational transition, not a vibrational one. Because the energy required for a vibrational transition is higher. So the photon would cause a change in the rotational state.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the lowest energy state
