Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium.

The problem says the concentration is 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for the complex is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in a form that can effectively chelate Ca²+ ions. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

So, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I think I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free ions depends on the formation constant, which is K here.

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is given as 5e10. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The Kf for this reaction is 5e10. That means the complex is very stable because Kf is large.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then at equilibrium, some of that will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me set up an ICE table. Initial concentrations: [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are both 0 initially. After dissociation, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ formed. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, because the dissociation is 1:1.

So, the expression for Kf would be [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−] = Kf. Plugging in the values, (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

Hmm, since Kf is so large, the denominator (0.02 - x) must be approximately zero. Because when K is that
