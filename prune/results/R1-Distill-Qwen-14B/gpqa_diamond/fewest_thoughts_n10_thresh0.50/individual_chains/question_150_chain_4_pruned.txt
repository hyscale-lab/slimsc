Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2=(9)/2=4.5? Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh wait, the formula is correct: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 because X (halogens) are zero. So (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (which counts as 3 for the ring and 2 double bonds?), plus a double bond somewhere else and a ring or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â€“ that's a pretty high ppm, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So that could be an aldehyde. The integration is 1H, so maybe a single aldehyde proton.

Next, 6.98 (d,
