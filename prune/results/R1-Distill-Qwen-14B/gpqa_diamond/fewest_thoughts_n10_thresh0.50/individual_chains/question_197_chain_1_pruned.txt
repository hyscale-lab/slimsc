Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction, probably an addition. But wait, red phosphorus is usually involved in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes in a way that might be more about adding across the double bond, but wait, I think I might be mixing it up with something else. Oh wait, maybe it's the action on an alkynyl group. Or wait, when you have an alkyne and you add HI, it could be a hydration or addition. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

But first, let me look at the spectral data for Compound X. The IR and NMR will help me figure out what X is, which then I can react to find the product.

Starting with the IR: I see strong absorption around 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region is probably O-H stretching, maybe from an acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C ring vibrations. So, putting that together, maybe X has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group. Could it be a benzoic acid derivative?

Looking at the 1H NMR:
