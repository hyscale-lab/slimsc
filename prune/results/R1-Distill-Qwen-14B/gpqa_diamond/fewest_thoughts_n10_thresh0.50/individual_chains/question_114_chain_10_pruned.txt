Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form a corresponding butanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that in organic reactions, especially nucleophilic additions, ketones can react with cyanide ions. Let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when you add NaCN, which provides CN- ions, it's a nucleophilic addition to the ketone. The ketone group is attacked, and the product would have the CN group attached. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, after the addition, there's a hydroxyl group and a nitrile.

Wait, the product structure: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The carbon chain is probably four carbons, with a hydroxyl and a methyl on C2, and a nitrile group on C4? Or maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl? Wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons with the nitrile on the end. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's not right. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, it's a ketone reacting with CN- via a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is the ketone's carbonyl oxygen is attacked by CN-, forming a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-m
