Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, we'll observe changes in brightness as the spots come into and go out of view. This is similar to the transit method used to detect exoplanets, where a planet blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

The question asks: To produce brightness variations with the same amplitude as the star's spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)?

Hmm, so I think I need to compare the change in brightness (the signal) caused by the spots to the change caused by a planet.

First, let's break down what's happening with the spots. The star's total brightness without any spots would be based on its surface area and temperature. When spots are present, they contribute less light. The total flux from the star is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The star's radius is Rsun, so the total surface area is 4πR^2. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, one hemisphere is 2πR², so spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Alternatively, maybe it's 20% of the entire star's surface? Because one hemisphere is half the surface. So if the spots cover 20% of the entire surface, that's 0.2 * 4πR². Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So filling factor is the fraction of the observed hemisphere covered by spots.

Wait, so the star's surface is a sphere. When we look at it, we see one hemisphere. If that hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots, the total area of spots visible is 0.2 * 2πR² (since a hemisphere is 2πR²).

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So when the star isn't rotating, we see 2πR². The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. When it's on the other side, they aren't.

So the total flux when the spot hemisphere is facing us is the normal flux minus the flux from the spots. The star emits flux F = σT^4. The total flux without any spots would be F_total = 4πR² * σTeff^4. But wait, no, actually the star emits with an effective temperature, so the flux per unit area is σTeff^4. So the total flux is 4πR² * σTeff^4.

When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the flux is F = (unspotted area * σTeff^4) + (spotted area * σ(Teff - ΔT)^4). The unspotted area is 0.8 * 2πR² (since 20% is spotted on the hemisphere). The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR².

So the flux when the spots are visible is F_spotty = [0.8 * 2πR² * σ(6000)^4 ] + [0.2 * 2πR² * σ(5000)^4 ].

The average flux without the spots would be F_clear = 4πR² * σ(6000)^4. No, wait, that's when there are no spots. But in the case where the spots are present, the average would be lower. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the change in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

Wait, the question states that the star's brightness variations are due to rotational modulation, which is because as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness would be when no spots are visible, and minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no, because when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. So the brightness variation would be a dip when the spots are visible.

But the question says that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So the dip in brightness when the planet transits the star is similar to the dip when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the question says, to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots would, what would be the radius of the planet?

So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) caused by the planet should match that caused by the spots.

So I need to compute the fractional change in flux (ΔF/F) for both cases and set them equal.

For the planet transit: when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks a part of the star's light. The blocked flux is the area of the planet's disk divided by the star's area. So the depth is (πR_p^2) / (πR_s^2) ) = (R_p/R_s)^2.

For the spots: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when the spots are not visible. The change in flux is F_clear - F_spotty, where F_clear is when the star is without spots (if that's possible). Alternatively, because the star is rotating, the maximum flux is when no spots are visible, and the minimum when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but the star's total flux without any spots would be F_total = 4πR² * σTeff^4.

But with spots, the total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere we see is F = (unspotted area * σTeff^4 ) + (spotted area * σ(Teff - delta T)^4).

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is ΔF = F_clear - F_spotty.

Wait, but F_clear is when all the star's surface is at Teff, which is only the case when the spots are not visible. But the star always has spots, so F_clear isn't actually possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, the question is comparing the maximum and minimum brightness as the star rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher.

Wait, but the star's other hemisphere is not spotty. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, and then the non-spotty comes into view. So the average flux would be somewhere between the two. But the question is about the variation in brightness—so the amplitude would be the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as when the star is viewed with the spot side and without the spot side.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots are covering part of the area. When it's the other hemisphere, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see them. So the flux variation is between when the spots are in view (F_spotty) and when they're not in view (F_clear).

Wait, but the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and the flux drops. Then, when the star rotates 180 degrees, the unspotted hemisphere comes into view, and flux is higher.

But wait, the star is a sphere. The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotty = (0.8 * 2πR² * σTeff^4) + (0.2 * 2πR² * σ(5000 K)^4) ) / (4πR²) ? No, wait. Because the star's total surface is 4πR², but when we observe it, we see a hemisphere of 2πR². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we're seeing 20% spots on that hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the contribution to the observed flux.

The star emits a total flux F = 4πR² * σTeff^4.

When the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux we receive is F_unspotted = 2πR² * σTeff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (unspotted part on hemisphere) * σTeff^4 + (spotted part) * σ(Teff - ΔT)^4.

The unspotted part on the hemisphere is 80% of 2πR²: 0.8 * 2πR².

The spotted part is 20% of 2πR²: 0.2 * 2πR².

So F_spotty = [0.8 * 2πR² * σ(6000)^4] + [0.2 * 2πR² * σ(5000)^4] 

But wait, Teff is 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K.

But the observed flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_spotty.

The flux when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us is F_unspotted = 2πR² * σ(6000)^4.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_spotty.

Wait, but the star's other hemisphere is not spotted, right? So when it's the other hemisphere, the entire 2πR² is at 6000K.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, part of that 2πR² is at 5000K.

So the variation in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotty.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be this difference. Similarly, when a planet transits, the variation is the planet's area over the star's area.

So for the planet, the dip in flux is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we set the dip from the planet equal to the dip from the spots.

Let me compute the dip for the spots first.

Compute F_unspotted and F_spotty:

F_unspotted = 2πR² * σ(6000)^4.

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2πR² * σ(6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2πR² * σ(5000)^4 )

The dip is F_unspotted - F_spotty.

But wait, actually, when the star is rotating, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotty).

So the amplitude (ΔF) is F_unspotted - F_spotty.

Let me compute this.

ΔF = [2πR² σ(6000^4)] - [0.8 * 2πR² σ(6000^4) + 0.2 * 2πR² σ(5000^4) ]

Factor out 2πR² σ:

ΔF = 2πR² σ [ (6000^4) - 0.8*(6000^4) - 0.2*(5000^4) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

= (6000^4) * (1 - 0.8) - 0.2*(5000^4)
= 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4
= 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So ΔF = 2πR² σ * 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The total flux when the star isn't blocked by the planet is F_total = 4πR² σ T^4.

Wait, no. Wait, in the scenario where the star isn't covered by spots, the brightness is F_total = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But in reality, the star has spots, and when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the average flux without any spots would be F_avg = 4π R² σ T^4 * (1/2) [assuming it's the same for all hemispheres? No, perhaps not. Wait, I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the fractional change in flux. The dip when the spots are visible is (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

Wait, but when the entire star is at 6000K (without any spots), the flux would be 4πR² σ (6000)^4. So when spots are on the hemisphere, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of the flux when the spots are visible as F_spotty and when they're not as F_unspotty. The change in flux is F_unspotty - F_spotty. 

So the amplitude (ΔF) is this difference. The fractional change is ΔF / F_unspotted.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to compute it numerically.

Compute Teff = 6000 K.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

Compute 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So ΔF = 2πR² σ * 0.2 * 6.71e14.

F_unspotted (when unspotty hemisphere is facing) is 2πR² σ (6e3)^4 = 2πR² σ * 1.296e15.

So the fractional dip is ΔF / F_unspotted:

(0.2 * 6.71e14) / (1.296e15) ) 

Compute numerator: 0.2 *6.71e14 =1.342e14.

Denominator: 1.296e15.

So 1.342e14 / 1.296e15 = approx 0.1036, or about 10.36% dip.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotty)/F_unspotted.

Wait, no, because F_unspotted is when the unspotty hemisphere is visible. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotty is.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as the ratio of the fluxes.

Flux when spotty hemisphere is visible: F_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R² * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² *5000^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from all parts visible. But the star's entire surface emits, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux from the front is the sum of unspotted and spotted parts. The back side (the other hemisphere) is not visible, but emits as well. So I think I made a mistake earlier.

Oh! Oh wait, no. When the star is a sphere, the flux we receive comes from the hemisphere facing us. The other hemisphere's flux doesn't reach us. So when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere changes.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2πR² * σ(6000^4) ) + (0.2 * 2πR² * σ(5000^4) )

Similarly, when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotty = 2πR² * σ(6000^4 )

So the amplitude of the variation is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Compute this:

F_unspotty = 2πR² σ (6e3)^4.

F_spotty = 2πR² σ [0.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ]

So F_unspotty - F_spotty = 2πR² σ [ (6e3)^4 - (0.8*(6e3)^4 + 0.2*(5e3)^4 ) ]

Factor out (6e3)^4:

= 2πR² σ (6e3)^4 [1 - 0.8 - 0.2*( (5e3/6e3)^4 ) ]

Compute (5e3 /6e3 )^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So 1 -0.8 = 0.2.

0.2 * (5e3/6e3)^4 ≈ 0.2 *0.482 ≈ 0.0964.

So [1 - 0.8 - 0.0964] = 0.2 -0.0964 = 0.1036.

So F_unspotty - F_spotty = 2π R² σ (6e3)^4 * 0.1036.

The dip in flux is (F_unspotty - F_spotty ) / F_unspotty.

F_unspotty is 2π R² σ (6e3)^4.

So the dip fraction is:

(2π R² σ (6e3)^4 * 0.1036) ) / ( 2π R² σ (6e3)^4 )

The 2π R² σ (6e3)^4 terms cancel out, so dip fraction is 0.1036 or about 10.36%.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is about 10.36% of the star's flux.

Now, for the planet transit: the dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

We need this to be equal to 0.1036.

So (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.1036.

Taking square root: R_planet / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

So the planet's radius is about 0.322 times that of the star.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So option D is ~0.32, which is approximately 0.322, so D is the correct answer.

Wait, but another way: is the dip caused by the planet equal to (R_p/R_s)^2, because the area blocked is pi R_p^2, and the area of the star is pi R_s^2. So the ratio is (R_p/R_s)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the star's spots, the dip is 10.36%. So the planet's transit dip must be 10.36%, so (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1036, R_p/R_s ~ 0.322, which is approximately 0.32, so D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the fractional change in flux caused by the spots and compare it to the flux blocked by the planet.

### Step 1: Flux Variation Due to Spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

When the star rotates, the flux variation is caused by the transition between the unspotted and spotty hemispheres. The total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is:

\[
F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = (0.8 \cdot 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.2 \cdot 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4)
\]

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these fluxes:

\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotty}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{unspotted}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotty}} \):

\[
\Delta F = 2\pi R^2 \sigma \left[ T_{\text{eff}}^4 - (0.8 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.2 T_{\text{spot}}^4) \right]
\]

Simplify:

\[
\Delta F = 2\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \left[ 1 - 0.8 - 0.2 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

### Step 2: Fractional Flux Variation
The fractional change in flux is:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - 0.8 - 0.2 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4
\]

Substitute \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 1 - 0.8 - 0.2(0.482) = 0.2 - 0.0964 = 0.1036
\]

Thus, the fractional flux variation caused by the spots is approximately \( 10.36\% \).

### Step 3: Flux Variation Due to a Planet
When a planet transits the star, the flux blocked is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star:

\[
\frac{\Delta F_{\text{planet}}}{F_{\text{star}}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036
\]

Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The closest option to \( 0.322 \) is **D) ~0.32**.

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

Answer: D
