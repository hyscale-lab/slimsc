Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write out S first.

Wait, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Right? And c is h/(4π). So A_y is c multiplied by this matrix. That would make A_y:
[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Because matrix multiplication is linear, so each element is multiplied by c. So the off-diagonal elements are c*(-i) and c*i. Let me write that out.

So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So each element of S is multiplied by c.

So A_y matrix is:
[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))     0 ]

Wait, but wait another moment. Oh, wait, S has (0, -i) in the first row. So when multiplied by c, the top right element is -i*c, and the bottom left is i*c. So yes, as I wrote above.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (A_y - a I) is:
[ -a   (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (i*(-i))(h/(4π))^2 ) ].

Wait, let's compute the determinant. The product of the off-diagonal terms is
