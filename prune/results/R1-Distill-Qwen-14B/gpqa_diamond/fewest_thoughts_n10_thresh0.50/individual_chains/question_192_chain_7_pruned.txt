Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it step by step. Let me think through this.

The question is about the electric field outside a conducting sphere with a cavity. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the behavior of charges on the surface and the resulting electric fields are key concepts. 

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. 

The question asks about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so point P is outside the conductor, but the conductor has a cavity. I think the key here is to figure out how the charges are distributed and what the field looks like outside.

First, when a conductor is neutral and has a cavity with a charge, I recall that the conductor's internal cavity charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on the conductor is zero. So, the charge inside the cavity (+q) will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. That would be a -q charge inside the conductor, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Wait, no, because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner surface has -q induced by the +q in the cavity. So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was uncharged. The cavity has +q. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So, the conductor as a whole has +q on the outside.

But wait no, because the conductor was initially neutral. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor charge zero
