Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons in addition to 3 protons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about relativistic speeds and energy. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we use the relativistic equations. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So the formula for the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the question is asking for the energy of the collider. Wait, is it the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because sometimes in these problems, it's about the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

The problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which makes me think it's the kinetic energy, but I'm not certain. Wait, RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so their total energy (relativistic) is gamma m c², which is the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy. Alternatively, sometimes the kinetic energy is given by (gamma -1) m c². So which is it here?

Wait, looking at the question again: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy provided by the collider is the kinetic energy, I think. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm, not entirely sure. But I'll proceed and see.

So first, let's find gamma. v is 0.96c. So v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute that. v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is lithium-6, right? So the mass is about the sum of protons and neutrons. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are about 939 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is approximately (3 * 938 + 3 * 939) MeV.

Calculating that: 3*(938 + 939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. Which is 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The exact mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is a bit different because it's a bound system, so the mass is actually a bit less than the sum of individual nucleons. But for an approximate calculation, I think using 6 nucleons each at about 938 MeV would be close enough. Alternatively, I can use the exact atomic mass.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think about that. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01759335114 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², the rest mass energy would be 6.01759335114 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.01759335 * 931.5 ≈ 0.01759 * 931.5 ≈ let's see, 0.01759 * 900 = 15.831, and 0.01759*31.5≈0.553. So about 16.384 MeV. So total is approximately 5589 +16.384 = 5605.384 MeV, which is 5.605384 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the rest mass as m = 6 * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is about 938 MeV. So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the entire nucleus as approximately the sum of the individual particles. So perhaps 5.6 GeV is a good number to use.

Now, the energy E is gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Wait, so 3.5714 * 5.628.

Let me calculate that step by step. 3 *5.628 is 16.884. 0.5714 *5.628 ≈ let's see. 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814. 0.0714 *5.628 ≈ around 0.403. So adding 2.814 + 0.403 ≈ 3.217. So total is 16.884 +3.217 ≈ 20.101 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.628 = ?

Well, 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.028 = 0.0999992.

So sum is 2.14284 + 0.0999992 ≈ 2.2428.

So total E is 17.857 +2.2428 = 20.0998 GeV, approximately 20.10 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I was a bit off in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the gamma. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct. So maybe I should compute E more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is better done with more precise values.

Let me compute gamma more precisely. 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28^2 = 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714... 

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Let me compute it more accurately. Using exact values, the mass of Li-6 is 6.01759335114 u. So, m c² is 6.01759335114 * 931.5 MeV.

So 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01759335114 *931.5 MeV = let's compute this:

0.01759335114 *931.5 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.00059335114 *931.5 ≈ 0.00059335 *931.5 ≈ 0.5512.

So adding 9.315 +6.5205 =15.8355; plus 0.5512 is around 16.3867.

So m c² =5589 +16.3867 ≈ 5605.3867 MeV, which is 5.6053867 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.6053867 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6053867.

Let me break it down:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6053867 = let's calculate that.

First, 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0053867 ≈ approximately 3.57142857 *0.005 = 0.01785714285; and 3.57142857 *0.0003867 ≈ 0.00138571428. So total is 0.01785714285 +0.00138571428 ≈ 0.019242857.

So 0.6053867 part gives 2.142857142 + 0.019242857 ≈ 2.1621.

Adding that to the 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.1621 ≈19.01924285 GeV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 3.5714 *5.6 is about 20.10, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.6053867 directly.

Let me think of it as:

3.57142857 = 3 + 0.57142857.

So,

3 *5.6053867 = 16.8161601.

0.57142857 *5.6053867.

Let me compute that:

0.5 *5.6053867 =2.80269335.

0.07142857 *5.6053867 ≈ 0.07142857 *5.6053867.

Hmm, 0.07 *5.6053867≈0.392377.

0.00142857 *5.6053867≈≈0.00799999.

So total is approximately 0.392377 +0.00799999≈0.400376.

Adding to 2.80269335 gives 2.80269335 +0.400376 ≈3.20306935.

So the total E is 16.8161601 +3.20306935 ≈20.01922945 GeV, approximately 20.0192 GeV.

Wait, that's around 20.0192 GeV. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to my calculation of approximately 20.0192 GeV. Hmm, but wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation or in the mass.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes, in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, it refers to the kinetic energy. So let's think about that.

Kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) m c².

So if I calculate K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714, so gamma -1 is 2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 *5.6053867 GeV.

Let me compute that. 2 *5.6053867 is 11.2107734.

0.5714 *5.6053867.

Again, 0.5 *5.6053867 is 2.80269335.

0.0714 *5.6053867 ≈ 0.400376.

So 2.80269335 +0.400376 ≈3.20306935.

So K = 11.2107734 +3.20306935 ≈14.41384275 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 14.41 GeV, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe I should have used the total energy. So perhaps the question is actually referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is because the problem says the energy of the collider. Wait, RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. I think the energy in colliders is typically given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy.

Wait, let me check a reference. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV each, which is their kinetic energy. So the total energy is gamma m c^2, and the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c^2.

So if the question is about the energy the collider imparts, it's the kinetic energy. So in that case, K is about 14.41 GeV. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the question refers to the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass I'm using is incorrect. Let's check the exact value for the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.01759335114 u, as I said earlier. So 6.01759335114 u times 931.5 MeV/u is:

6.01759335114 *931.5 = let's compute this.

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01759335114 *931.5 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.01759335114 ×931.5 = ?

Well, 0.01759335114 ×931.5 = (1759335114e-10) ×931.5.

But perhaps using a calculator approach:

0.01759335114 ×931.5 = ?

Let me compute 931.5 ×0.01 =9.315.

931.5 ×0.007 =6.5205.

931.5 ×0.00059335114 = ?

0.0005 is 0.46575.

0.00009335114 ×931.5 ≈ approx 86.6333e-5 *931.5 = around 0.081025?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.01759335114 ×931.5.

0.01759335114 ×931.5 = 0.01759335114 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.00059335114 *931.5 = let's compute 0.0005 *931.5 =0.46575.

0.00009335114 *931.5 ≈ 0.087333.

So summing all parts:

9.315 +6.5205 =15.8355.

Now 0.46575 +0.087333 ≈0.553083.

So total is 15.8355 +0.553083 =16.388583 MeV.

So total m c^2 is 5589 MeV +16.388583 MeV =5605.388583 MeV, which is 5.605388583 GeV.

So now, the total energy E is gamma times m c^2.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.605388583 GeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.605388583.

Breaking it down:

3 ×5.605388583 =16.81616575.

0.57142857 ×5.605388583 = ?

0.5 ×5.605388583 =2.8026942915.

0.07142857 ×5.605388583.

0.07 ×5.605388583 ≈0.392377201.

0.00142857 ×5.605388583 ≈≈0.007999999.

So summing for 0.07 and 0.00142857: about 0.392377201 +0.007999999≈0.4003772.

So adding 2.8026942915 +0.4003772 = 3.2030714915.

So E =16.81616575 +3.2030714915 ≈20.01923724 GeV.

So about 20.0192 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps my estimation for the mass is a bit off. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula and precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma using more precise values.

v =0.96c → beta =0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Compute beta^2: 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.571428571428571.

So that's correct.

So the calculation seems correct, so why is the option C 20.132 GeV?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units.

Li-6 has a mass of 6.01759335114 u, as per the table. So 6.01759335114 u ×931.5 MeV/u = 6.01759335114 ×931.5 = ?

Let me calculate that precisely.

6 ×931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01759335114 ×931.5 =?

0.01759335114 ×931.5 = 0.01759335114 ×931.5.

We can compute this as:

0.01759335114 ×931.5 = (0.01 +0.007 +0.00059335114) ×931.5.

0.01 ×931.5 =9.315.

0.007 ×931.5 =6.5205.

0.00059335114 ×931.5 = let's compute that.

0.0005 ×931.5 =0.46575.

0.00009335114 ×931.5 = approximately 0.087333.

So adding these gives 9.315 +6.5205 =15.8355; 0.46575 +0.087333 ≈0.553083.

So 15.8355 +0.553083 =16.388583 MeV.

So m c²=5605.388583 MeV =5.605388583 GeV.

So E = gamma × m c² =3.57142857 ×5.605388583 GeV.

Calculating precisely:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.605388583 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.005388583 = let's compute this.

0.005 ×3.57142857 =0.01785714285.

0.000388583 ×3.57142857 ≈0.001385714285.

So 0.005388583 ×3.57142857 ≈0.01785714285 +0.001385714285 ≈0.01924285714.

So 3.57142857 ×0.005388583 ≈0.01924285714.

So 3.57142857 ×0.605388583 =2.142857142 +0.01924285714 ≈2.16210 GeV.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.16210 ≈20.01924285 GeV.

So approximately 20.0192 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV and D as 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, so none of the options exactly match 20.0192. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.11 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate with more precise gamma.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714... So that's correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the mass of the nucleus should be calculated using the exact atomic mass, including binding energy. Wait, but the binding energy is usually a small correction. For light nuclei, it's about a few MeV. For example, the binding energy for Li-6 is about 16.388583 MeV (as we calculated earlier), which is about 0.01759335114 u.

Wait, perhaps using the exact mass in atomic mass units is better. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, such as protons and neutrons, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's using the mass of the entire nucleus, but perhaps the question is considering the nucleus as a single particle with mass m. So perhaps the mass is 6×938 MeV/c², which is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So using m =5.628 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628 = let's compute.

0.5 *5.628 =2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628 ≈0.403.

So 2.814 +0.403 =3.217.

So total E =16.884 +3.217 =20.101 GeV.

That's about 20.101 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Because when using the exact mass of Li-6, I got around 20.0192 GeV, but using 6 nucleons each at 938 MeV, I get about 20.101 GeV. The exact value would be around 20.02 GeV, which is close to option C, but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, but wait, earlier I saw that K was around 14.41 GeV, which isn't an option. So probably, the problem is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy is calculated using the relativistic energy equation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Because the way the problem is phrased, it's about the speed being 0.96c, which relates directly to gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exact product of gamma and m c² using more precise numbers.

m c² is 5.605388583 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 3.5714285714 ×5.605388583.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.605388583.

Breaking it down:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.605388583 = ?

Hmm, 0.605388583 can be written as 0.6 +0.005388583.

3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.005388583 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×0.005 =0.017857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.000388583 =?

Well, 3.5714285714 ×0.0003 =0.0010714285714.

3.5714285714 ×0.000088583 ≈ approximately 0.00031632.

So 0.0010714285714 +0.00031632 ≈0.001387748571.

Adding that to 0.017857142857 gives 0.017857142857 +0.001387748571 ≈0.01924489143.

So 3.5714285714 ×0.005388583 ≈0.01924489143.

So total 3.5714285714 ×0.605388583 is 2.14285714284 +0.01924489143 ≈2.16210203427.

So overall E =17.857142857 +2.16210203427 ≈20.019244891 GeV.

So approximately 20.0192 GeV.

Looking at the given options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the kinetic energy. Let me compute K again.

K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

Gamma -1 =2.5714285714.

So K =2.5714285714 *5.605388583 GeV.

Calculating:

2.5714285714 ×5 =12.857142857.

2.5714285714 ×0.605388583 = ?

Again, breaking it down:

2.5714285714 ×0.6 =1.54285714284.

2.5714285714 ×0.005388583 ≈?

0.005 ×2.5714285714 =0.012857142857.

0.000388583 ×2.5714285714 ≈0.00100285714.

So sum is 0.012857142857 +0.00100285714 ≈0.013860.

So 2.5714285714 ×0.605388583 ≈1.54285714284 +0.013860 ≈1.55671714284.

So K =12.857142857 +1.55671714284 ≈14.41386 GeV.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the question is indeed about the total energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the speed given is for each nucleon, not the entire nucleus. No, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus as a whole moves at that speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single lithium-6 nucleus as 6 × (mass of a nucleon), which is 6 × 938 MeV/c² =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

So using that, E =gamma * m c² =3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

3.57142857 ×5.628 = let's compute.

3 ×5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628.

0.5 ×5.628 =2.814.

0.07142857 ×5.628 ≈0.403.

So 2.814 +0.403 =3.217.

Total E =16.884 +3.217 =20.101 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.101 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the intended approach is to use m=6 ×938 MeV, leading to E=20.101 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV when considering more precise numbers, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise gamma gives a slightly higher result.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, it's exact. So perhaps the discrepancy is due to using a more precise value of the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass of Li-6 as 6.01759335114 u, leading to m c²=6.01759335114 ×931.5=5.60538 GeV.

So 3.57142857 ×5.60538 =20.0192 GeV.

But that doesn't match any of the options except option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate the gamma and energy again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy per nucleon. So, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and perhaps the energy should be considered per nucleon. But that doesn't seem to fit the question, which is about the energy of the nucleus.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". RHIC collides heavy ions, so the energy would be for the entire nucleus, not per nucleon.

So, given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, let me try calculating gamma again.

Wait, another approach: using beta =0.96.

So gamma =1/sqrt(1 -beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 =3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So, with m c² =5.60538 GeV, E=3.57142857 ×5.60538.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.60538.

I can write this as (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.60538.

3×5.60538 =16.81614.

0.57142857×5.60538 = ?

Compute 0.5 ×5.60538 =2.80269.

0.07142857 ×5.60538 ≈0.40038.

So 2.80269 +0.40038=3.20307.

So total E=16.81614 +3.20307=20.01921 GeV.

So that's approximately 20.0192 GeV.

Wait, but the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. So that's about 0.11 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 931.5 MeV/u.

So m =6.01759335114 u → m c² =6.01759335114 ×931.5 MeV.

So 6 ×931.5 =5589.

0.01759335114 ×931.5 = let's calculate.

0.01759335114 ×931.5.

Compute 931.5 ×0.01759335114.

Let me compute this as:

931.5 ×0.01 =9.315.

931.5 ×0.007 =6.5205.

931.5 ×0.00059335114 = ?

Compute 931.5 ×0.0005 =0.46575.

931.5 ×0.00009335114 = approximately 0.087333.

So 0.46575 +0.087333 =0.553083.

So total is 9.315 +6.5205 +0.553083 =16.388583 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +16.388583=5605.388583 MeV =5.605388583 GeV.

So E = gamma × m c² =3.57142857 ×5.605388583 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.605388583 = ?

Let me use a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.605388583 → this equals approximately 20.0192 GeV.

So the precise calculation gives me E≈20.0192 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to round to four decimal places, leading to 20.0192 GeV, which is 20.0192 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again: A) 18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. None of them are exactly 20.0192 GeV. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass of the nucleus as 5.628 GeV (6×938 MeV), leading to E=3.5714 ×5.628=20.101 GeV, which would round to option C:20.132 GeV if considering more precise gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the gamma calculation with more precise sqrt.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is precisely 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy as the answer. Let me compute the kinetic energy again.

K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma-1 =2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 ×5.605388583 GeV.

Compute:

2.57142857 ×5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 ×0.605388583 = ?

2.57142857 ×0.6 =1.542857142.

2.57142857 ×0.005388583 ≈0.01386 (from previous calculation).

So approximately 1.542857142 +0.01386=1.556717.

So K=12.85714285 +1.556717=14.41386 GeV.

Which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assuming m is the rest mass of the nucleus. Perhaps the problem is considering each nucleon's energy.

Wait, but the nucleus is moving as a whole, so the total energy is gamma * m_total c², where m_total is the total mass of the nucleus.

So I think the calculation I did earlier is correct.

But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended approach is to use m=6×938 MeV, leading to E=20.101 GeV, which is option C if rounded to four decimal places as 20.101 GeV. But none of the options exactly match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute gamma and E using exact values.

Gamma =3.57142857.

m c²=5.605388583 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.605388583.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.605388583.

Let me use a calculator-like approach:

3.57142857 ×5.605388583 = ?

Compute 3 ×5.605388583 =16.81616575.

0.57142857 ×5.605388583 = ?

0.5 ×5.605388583 =2.8026942915.

0.07142857 ×5.605388583.

0.07 ×5.605388583 =0.3923772008.

0.00142857 ×5.605388583 ≈0.007999999999.

So sum 0.3923772008 +0.007999999999 ≈0.4003772.

So 0.57142857 ×5.605388583 =2.8026942915 +0.4003772 ≈3.2030714915.

So E=16.81616575 +3.2030714915 ≈20.01923724 GeV.

So approximately 20.0192 GeV.

Since the options don't have this value, the closest option is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mass was considered as 5.7 GeV leading to a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is 20.0192 GeV, but the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is 0.1128 GeV higher. That's a significant difference, about 0.56% higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation for gamma again.

Wait, let me recompute gamma:

v=0.96c → beta=0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Maybe the mass was taken as 6 ×938.272 MeV, the exact mass of a proton and neutron. Let me recompute.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6:

3 protons:3×938.272=2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3×939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total:2814.816+2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m c²=5.633511 GeV.

E=gamma ×m c²=3.57142857 ×5.633511.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 ×5.633511.

Breakdown:

3 ×5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 ×5.633511.

0.5 ×5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 ×5.633511 ≈0.404444.

So 2.8167555 +0.404444 ≈3.2211995.

So total E=16.900533 +3.2211995≈20.1217325 GeV.

This is approximately 20.1217 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Ah, now that makes sense. So perhaps the mistake was in using a lower mass estimate. So using more precise proton and neutron masses gives a higher rest mass, leading to a higher total energy.

So the correct approach would be to calculate m as 3*(proton mass) +3*(neutron mass), which gives m c² =5.6335 GeV. Then E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 ×5.6335 ≈20.12 GeV.

So the correct answer would be approximately 20.12 GeV, which matches option C:20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate masses of a proton (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m_{\text{Li-6}} = 3 m_p + 3 m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]

Convert to GeV:

\[
m_{\text{Li-6}} c^2 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \times 1 \, \text{GeV}/1000 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Break it down:

\[
3 \times 5.633511 = 16.900533, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 3.2212
\]

\[
E \approx 16.900533 + 3.2212 = 20.1217 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1217 \, \text{GeV} \), which is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
