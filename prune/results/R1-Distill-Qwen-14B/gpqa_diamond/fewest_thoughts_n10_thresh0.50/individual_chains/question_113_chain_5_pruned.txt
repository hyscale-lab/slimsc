Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR data. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak—could that be an alcohol (like an -OH stretch) or something else? Also, in the same FTIR, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Oh, the 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring, maybe a C=C stretch, or perhaps another carbonyl group. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl (which is usually around 1700-1750), so maybe it's conjugated or something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some double bonds.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the molecule has an alkene group somewhere. Maybe that's part of an ester or another carbonyl compound. 

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at
