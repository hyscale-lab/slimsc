Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to work through it.

So the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics because of the effects of special relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is different.

Wait, the formula for the relative velocity u' when one frame is moving at speed v relative to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Actually, when we talk about relative velocity, if I'm astronaut A moving at 0.6c, then what is the speed of astronaut B relative to me? So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where u is B's speed in the lab frame, and v is A's speed in the lab frame. Wait, but wait, no. Because in the
