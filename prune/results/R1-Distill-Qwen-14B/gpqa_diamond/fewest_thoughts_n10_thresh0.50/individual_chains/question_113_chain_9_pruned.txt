Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying numbers of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that area usually indicate O-H groups because they are typically due to either alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, if it's a broad peak, it could also be an amine, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't have nitrogen. Let's move on.

There are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a carbonyl. That makes me think maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, could it be a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone next to an aromatic ring? Or perhaps an enone system? Or maybe it's a carbonyl from a different functional group, like an acid where the carbonyl is conjugated with something else.

Wait, another thought: 1650 could also be a C=C stretch. Oh, but wait, the 1H NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond, which would show as a peak around 1650 in the IR as well. So maybe the 1650 is a C=C (olefinic) stretch. So the two peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be a carbonyl (like an ester or ketone) and a double bond (like an alkene).

Now, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So, vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond. That suggests the molecule has an alkene group
