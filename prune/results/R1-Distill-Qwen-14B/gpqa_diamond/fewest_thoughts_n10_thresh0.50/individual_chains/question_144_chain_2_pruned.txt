Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their lifetimes are related to their energy and mass. Oh wait, and the mean decay distance would be how far they travel before decaying, right?

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So I need to calculate the mean decay distance.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think the mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. The relation is something like τ (the lifetime) is inversely proportional to the width Γ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates the two: Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. So Γ = ħ / τ, which can be rearranged to τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The uncertainty principle says ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, so ΔE ≈ Γ. So Δt ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation. I think the lifetime τ is approximately ħBar divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the width, which is the total decay rate, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width.

So the first step is to find the lifetime τ. Once I have τ, I can find the velocity of the meson, then multiply velocity by lifetime to get the mean decay distance L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? The meson is produced with energy E. Since E is much larger than its mass (E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV), I can approximate it as a relativistic particle. For high energies, the velocity v is approximately c, but let's get precise.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor. So gamma = E/(m c²). Then, beta is v/c, and beta ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 1 - (m² c^4)/(
