Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. There are two reactions mentioned:

1. The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is another name for methylacetone, I think) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

2. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

And the options for A and B are given in options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that nitrile groups can be introduced into ketones via nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but with the structure given, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition? Let me think. Oh wait, I think it's about the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yes, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction is typically done in the presence of a strong acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4, because the acid helps protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (a ketone) reacts with NaCN and reagent A. The product is a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A) or maybe something else.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzyl group attached. They're reacting it with B (and water) to get a butanoic acid. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So what's the reaction that converts a nitrile into a carboxylic acid?

Oh right, hydrolysis of nitriles. Under acidic or basic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed. Under strong acidic conditions, like HCl, and heat, nitriles can hydrolyze to give carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, they might form carboxylates which can be acidified.

Wait, but in this case
