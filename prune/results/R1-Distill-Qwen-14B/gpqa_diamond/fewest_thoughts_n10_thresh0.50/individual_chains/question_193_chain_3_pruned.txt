Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, actually, parallax is in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so plx (in arcsec) = 1/d (in parsecs). Right, that's the standard formula.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. Wait, yeah, because 1/(x^5) is x^-5, so if x is 1/d, x^-5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So we're looking for the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr. Oh, right, that's like the number of stars as a function of r, so the differential number of stars with respect to r.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number. So
