Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let's break down the problem. I think I should start by figuring out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. 

So initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.01 / 0.04 = 0.25 M? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. Oh right, I made a mistake in the division earlier. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH (a strong base) to form acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid. So let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 0.04 L, concentration 0.025 M, so moles = 0.04 * 0.025 = 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question isn't asking for the volume, just the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

So first, let's find the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 10 cm³, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles. The equivalence point is when all acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Wait, another approach: when we add 25% of the
