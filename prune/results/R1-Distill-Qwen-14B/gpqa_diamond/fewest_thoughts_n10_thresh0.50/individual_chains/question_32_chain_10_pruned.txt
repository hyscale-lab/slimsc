Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so I guess nucleus X is a heavy nucleus. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium-6 perhaps? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, atomic number 3, mass number 6.

So first, I think I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus X. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and same for neutrons. So for Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Wait, let me compute that. 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. So m = 5.628 GeV/c². Wait, but wait, wait, I think I should check if this is the right approach. Because sometimes the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy, but I'm not sure if that's required here. For problems like this, I think we usually just take the sum of the individual masses
