Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means uniformly in space, like their actual positions are spread out without any particular clustering, but in reality, the galaxy is disk-shaped so maybe it's a simplified model.

So, the idea is that the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with the parallax value. Let's think about how parallax relates to distance. Parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d): p = 1/d. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density of stars (n) is constant. So, n is the same everywhere. The number of stars in a volume would be n multiplied by the volume.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. Let's think about how a change in parallax relates to the distance. If parallax is p, then d = 1/p. So, when parallax changes by a small amount dp, what's the corresponding change in distance? Hmm, because d = 1/p, so dd would be -1/p² dp. Or maybe I should think about it the other way, like how much distance corresponds to a range in parallax.

Wait, alternatively, the number of stars in a shell at a distance d with thickness dd would be the surface area of the shell (4πd²) times the volume element (like thickness, but in 3D it's 4πd² * dd) multiplied by the number density n. Wait, no: actually, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd would be n * (4πd² dd). Because the volume of the shell is 4πd² dd.

But wait, this is under the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density n is a constant.

Now, I need to express this number in terms of parallax p. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So
