Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's rest frame, the light speed would be c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n.

But the glass is moving relative to the lab. So the observer is in the lab frame. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. But wait, does that apply when the medium itself is moving?

Wait, no. In special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the medium is a glass, which complicates things because normally, the velocity of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion relative to the observer.

Wait, but hold on, in special relativity, it's the vacuum speed that's c. When a medium is involved, things are a bit different. So perhaps the velocity of light in the moving medium is still c/n relative to the medium, but when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Alternatively, maybe I should treat the glass as a frame of reference moving at velocity v relative
