Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, wait. Interatomic distance... Oh, wait, in crystals that's usually the lattice parameter, right? So like, the edge length a. So the interatomic distance here is the same as 'a' in a rhombohedral structure, which is 10 Angstroms.

Rhombohedral crystal – so that's a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all angles are equal too. Like, it's not cubic because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So it's a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. In this case, 30 degrees each.

The interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The (111) plane is one of the family of planes, so we need to use the formula for interplanar spacing.

The formula I remember for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma. So that simplifies things a bit.

So substituting alpha for all the angles: cos(alpha) = cos(30 degrees). Let me compute that. Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk * cos(alpha) + 2hl * cos(alpha) + 2kl * cos(alpha) )

Because h, k, l are 1 for the (111) plane.

Plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1*0.8660 + 2*1*1*0.8660 + 2*1*1*0.8660 )

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

Sum the first three terms: 1 +1 +1 =3.

Now the other terms: 2hk cos(alpha) is 2*1*1 * 0.866 = 1.732. Same for the other two terms, so three such terms: 1.732 each.

Wait, no, the formula is 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, 2kl cos alpha. But since all are the same, it's 2hk cos(alpha) + 2hl cos(alpha) + 2kl cos(alpha).

So 3 terms. Let's compute each:

Each term is 2*1*1 * cos(30) = 2 * 0.8660 ≈ 1.732.

So
