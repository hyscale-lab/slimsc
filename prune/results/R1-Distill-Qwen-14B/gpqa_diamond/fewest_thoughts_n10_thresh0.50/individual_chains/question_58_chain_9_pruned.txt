Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results that don't physically make sense. So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this process when energies are high.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think strings are supposed to be a theory that avoids some of the problems of quantum gravity. Since it's a theory that incorporates higher dimensions and incorporates gravity, maybe it's a candidate for being a theory that doesn't require regularization. I think string theories might have better behaved UV behavior because they're background-dependent in a different way. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? And I remember that QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. So when you calculate things perturbatively, you might not get the same kinds of divergences as in other theories. But wait, does that mean it doesn't require regularization? Or maybe it just makes certain calculations easier because the interactions are weaker at high energies. I think QCD still needs regularization because even with asymptotic freedom, you can have loop divergences which require renormalization. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Renormalization is a form of regularization, but perhaps QCD doesn't require additional regularization beyond the usual renormalization because the theory is renormalizable. Or does it?

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is an abelian gauge theory. I remember that QED is renormalizable, but when you do calculations, you often get divergent integrals. So you need to use regularization techniques like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization to handle those divergences before doing renormalization. So QED does require regularization, which means option C is not the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical E&M, you don't deal with divergent integrals in the same way because
