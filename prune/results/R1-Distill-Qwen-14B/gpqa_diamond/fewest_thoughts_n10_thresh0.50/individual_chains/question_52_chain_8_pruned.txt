Okay, so I'm facing this astronomy problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

Alright, the problem talks about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the star's parameters without spots: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. When it's spot-free, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait, does the presence of spots lower the effective temperature because they are darker, meaning they emit less? I think so. Because dark spots (probably sunspots) are cooler regions on the star's surface, so when a significant portion is covered, the star's overall emission is less, hence lower Teff.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes between when the star doesn't have spots and when it does.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, it's lower.

The problem states that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And we’re assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which is a standard assumption in stellar atmospheres.

I remember that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio R = (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, wait, in this case, the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Hmm.

Wait, the ratio of n1 to n2 (n1/n2) is given. Let me think. If the ratio decreases when spots are present, that means when T decreases (since spots lower the effective temperature), n1/n2 becomes smaller. So a lower T would make the ratio n1/n2 smaller. Because in the Boltzmann factor, higher T would increase the exponent, making the ratio larger.

Wait, let's clarify. The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Suppose E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. Then, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the term increases. So n2 would be higher when T is higher, making n2/n1 higher. So n1/n2 would be lower when T is higher.

Wait, no: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, so the exponential increases. So n2/n1 increases with T, meaning that n1/n2 decreases.

In the problem, when
