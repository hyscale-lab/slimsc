Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

So, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star move a little. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

Wait, wait, the problem gives the shifts for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. But wait, the question is about the orbital periods of the planets. How does the shift relate to the period?

Oh right, the RV method relates the star's velocity to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since the planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_p << M_*, so
