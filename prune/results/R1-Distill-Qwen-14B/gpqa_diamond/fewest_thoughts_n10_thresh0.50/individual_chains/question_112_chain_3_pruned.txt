Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D with probabilities and average values given.

Hmm, so this seems to involve some quantum state transformations and operator matrix representations. Let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. So I should probably normalize this state first because the coefficients are complex.

Let me calculate the normalization factor. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, the inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) divided by something, wait, no. Let me compute |a|^2 + |b|^2 where a and b are the coefficients.

Wait, the state is a linear combination: a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b= (2-i). So the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b².

Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional to that. So that's the normalized state.

Okay, next, the operator whose matrix is Aij: it's a 2x2 matrix (since |up> and |down> are the basis). The elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix looks like:

[0,   hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2, 0 ]

Because for i≠j, which in a 2x2 matrix means (1,2) and (2,1) positions. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, that's interesting. So this operator has a matrix representation that's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X swaps the basis states. Or maybe it's a different operator.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) * X. So the operator is (hbar/2)
