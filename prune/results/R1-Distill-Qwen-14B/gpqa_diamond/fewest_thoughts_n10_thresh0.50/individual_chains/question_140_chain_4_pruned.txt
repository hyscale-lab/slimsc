Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about a substance X and some reactions it undergoes. Let me see what I can figure out.

First, the problem statement: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to another substance.

Wait, the question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to find what elements are in X, then sum the lightest and heaviest's atomic masses.

Let me break it down.

First, the reaction of X with Y. The reaction is violent and produces gas W. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Oh, that's a key point. Let's think about common gases. What gas has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule?

For example, hydrogen gas is H2. Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So W can't be H2 since 0=1 only in the sense each has one P but zero N. Wait, but for the molecule, maybe it's O2? No. Let's think again.

Wait, another possibility: CO2? No, that's a molecule but it's more complicated. Or maybe it's a molecule like D2O, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's NH3? No, but that's a liquid sometimes.

Wait, let's get back. The molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider a molecule of gas W. So for each molecule, sum of protons is the atomic number of each atom multiplied by its count. Sum of neutrons is the same.

Wait, perhaps each molecule has atoms that collectively have equal number of protons and neutrons. Or, perhaps each individual atom in W's molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. That's another possibility.

Wait, W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if it's H2O, then each H has 1
