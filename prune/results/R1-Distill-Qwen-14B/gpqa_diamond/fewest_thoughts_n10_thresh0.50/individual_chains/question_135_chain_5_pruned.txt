Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λ f \barψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that the interaction term usually involves the coupling between the boson and the fermions. So in this case, X is the boson field, and the fermions are ψ_f, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing possible decay channels.

I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermions must have a mass that's less than half the mass of the boson. Because in a decay process, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for each fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, but wait. Each fermion has a rest mass, so for a pair like a quark and antiquark, their combined mass must be less than the mass of X. So for each possible fermion pair (like b b-bar, c c-bar, etc.), I need to check if their combined rest mass is less than 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. Here's what I remember:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Wait, but wait. When the boson X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than half the mass of X. Because in the rest frame of X, each fermion would have some kinetic energy, but the minimum mass they can have is when they are at rest. So the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X.

So for X to decay into a pair like b b-bar, each b has mass ~4.7 GeV. So together, that's 9.4 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. That's way too big. So X can't decay into b b-bar, right? Wait, but wait a second. Because in reality, when a particle decays, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent. So for X, which is 6 GeV, the sum
