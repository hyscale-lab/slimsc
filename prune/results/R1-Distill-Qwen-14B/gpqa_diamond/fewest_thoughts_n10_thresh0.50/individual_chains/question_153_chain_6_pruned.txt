Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll think this through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A, B, and C.

First, I'll tackle the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. The product is labeled A.

I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is the enolate from dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, and when deprotonated, forms a strong enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the acrylate group is E-configured. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3, but wait, actually, wait. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-; so methyl acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOCH3. But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, wait, that would be a substitution on the acrylate.

Wait, no, the structure is more likely to be CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the third carbon. So maybe it's CH₂=CH-C(p-t
