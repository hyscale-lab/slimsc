Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives me the brightness each spectrograph can handle. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, and HIRES can go up to 16. So any star that is brighter than (has a lower magnitude than) 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. But wait, actually, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" and "brighter than 16 mag" meaning that ESPRESSO can see stars with apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17? Or is it the other way around? Wait, higher magnitude means dimmer. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag in V, that means it's magnitude is less than 17 because lower numbers are brighter.

Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Wait, brightness is inversely related to magnitude. So a lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star has a V magnitude brighter than 17, that would mean it's magnitude is less than 17. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17 (i.e., magnitude ≤17). Same for HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed, so their magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. The way it's phrased is a bit tricky. "Brighter than 17 mag" implies that the star's V magnitude is lower (because lower magnitude is brighter). So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V=17, meaning any star with V ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe up to V=16 (so V ≤16).

So the key is to find which stars have apparent V magnitudes ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. But wait, no. Wait, the question is asking which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So, a star must be observable by both. So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait no, no. Wait, the brightness requirement for each spectrograph is different. So, a star must be bright enough for both.

Wait, the question is: Which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES? So, each star must satisfy both observatories' brightness requirements. So, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) AND ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait no, because HIRES requires brighter than 16 mag (so V ≤16). So, the star must have V ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is V=16.5, it's dimmer than what HIRES can detect. But ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so it's sufficient, but HIRES can't.

Wait, wait wait. Let's parse the question again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, stars with V magnitude less than 17 (brighter). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V magnitude less than 16. So a star must have V ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if a star's V is, say, 16.5, then ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES cannot. But if a star's V is 16 or less, then both can see it.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Maybe each spectrograph can detect up to their maximum magnitude. So, for ESPRESSO, stars up to V=17 can be observed. For HIRES, up to V=16. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than both 17 and 16? No, that's impossible because 16 is less than 17.

Wait, no, that can't be right. So, wait, perhaps the way to think is that a star's apparent magnitude must be ≤ the maximum that each spectrograph can handle. So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, but that's impossible because if a star's V is ≤16, it's automatically ≤17. So, any star that is ≤16 can be detected by both. But if a star is between 16 and 17, then only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So, the star needs to be observable by both, which requires that the apparent V magnitude is ≤16 (since HIRES can't go beyond that, and ESPRESSO can go beyond but the star needs to be within both's limits).

Alternatively, if the star's V is ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. If V is ≤16, HIRES can see it. So any star with V ≤16 can be seen by both.

But wait, let's look at the individual stars:

Each star's information is given. Some have absolute magnitudes, some have apparent. Let me process each star.

Star1: absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log10(1) is 0, so m = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is ≤16, so can be observed by both.

Star2: apparent V magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, but apparent magnitude is already given, so no need to compute. So m=16.5. ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, so yes. HIRES can observe up to 16. So 16.5 is beyond HIRES's limit. So Star2 can only be observed by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: apparent V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. Also, it's located at 15 pc. Wait, but the apparent V is given as 15.5, but there's extinction (interstellar dust) because of E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed apparent V would be higher (dimmer) because of extinction. Wait, how does that work?

I remember that the formula for extinction in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

But wait, how does that affect the apparent magnitude? The extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed magnitude is higher than the intrinsic (unreddened) one. So if the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is m, the observed would be m + A_V.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Apparent magnitude as given is the observed value, or the intrinsic? No, the question says, Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. But wait, that's after considering the distance modulus? Or is that the observed magnitude including extinction?

Wait, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Hmm. So I think the given apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is the observed value, which includes extinction. Because the E(B-V) is given. So, but how does that affect the ability to detect it? Wait, no, the extinction (absorption) makes the star appear dimmer, so a higher apparent magnitude. But wait, the way the question is phrased, if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, which leads to A_V=1.86, then the extinction is already included in the apparent magnitude. Or is the given 15.5 the intrinsic magnitude, and the extinction adds to it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The apparent magnitude is what the star's brightness is as observed from Earth, so it's affected by interstellar extinction. So, the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But wait, no, the formula is more precise. The extinction in the V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, if the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, and A_V is 1.86, then the observed magnitude is m_obs = m0 + A_V.

But wait, that can't be right because m0 is the apparent magnitude if there were no extinction. So, the star's light is dimmed, making it appear fainter (higher m). So, m_obs = m0 + A_V.

So if the question says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, that's the observed magnitude (including extinction). So, to find the intrinsic m0, we have m0 = m_obs - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, but does that matter for detection? Because the spectrographs observe the apparent magnitude. So, if Star3's observed m is 15.5, which includes extinction, then it's 15.5. So, can ESPRESSO and HIRES observe it?

But wait, the question is about whether the star can be observed. So the apparent magnitude as observed (including extinction) is the one that matters for the spectrograph's brightness limit.

So, Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. But for HIRES, it's 15.5 which is less than 16, so HIRES can observe it too. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Because the apparent magnitude given for Star3 is 15.5, which is after accounting for the distance modulus and extinction.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc. So, the apparent magnitude is already calculated, including any distance and extinction effects.

Wait, but how? Because the distance modulus would be 5 log10(15/10) = 5 * log(1.5) ≈ 5 * 0.176 = 0.88. So, if the absolute magnitude is M, then the apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = M + 0.88.

But Star3's absolute magnitude isn't given. Wait, no, wait. Star3's information is: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. So, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value (including extinction). So, the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = 15.5 - A_V = 15.5 - 3.1*0.6 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

But why do I care about m0? Because if the question were about whether the star is bright enough without extinction, but the spectrographs observe the apparent magnitude as observed, which includes extinction. So, for Star3, m_obs is 15.5, which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it, and less than 16 for HIRES as well, so both can.

Wait, 15.5 is less than both 16 and 17. So, yes, both can see it.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused, because the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is under both brightness limits, so both can observe.

Star4: absolute V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, and located at 10 pc.

So, to compute its apparent V magnitude: m0 = M + 5 log(d/10). d=10, so log(1) is 0. m0=15.5.

But wait, this is without extinction. Then, the observed m_obs = m0 + A_V. A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, so the apparent magnitude is 16.74. So, can ESPRESSO and HIRES see it?

ESPRESSO: can detect up to 17, so yes. HIRES can detect up to 16, so 16.74 is beyond that, so HIRES can't. So Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Star5: absolute V magnitude 16.5, located at 5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude: m0 = M + 5 log(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 log(0.5) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505≈15.0 mag.

But wait, Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is less than both 16 and 17. So both spectrographs can see it.

Wait, but wait, the question says Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, located at 5 pc, so distance modulus is 5 log(0.5) = -1.505, so m0=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 approx 15.0. So m=15.0.

So, Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is within both ESPRESSO and HIRES' limits. So both can detect it.

So, now, go through each star:

Star1: m=15.5. Both can see.

Star2: m=16.5. ESPRESSO can (<=17), HIRES can't (needs <=16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5. Both can see.

Star4: m=16.74. Only ESPRESSO can see.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can see.

Now, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5: Star4 can’t be seen by HIRES, so incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5: Both can be seen by both, so correct.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2 can't be seen by HIRES, so incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can't be seen by HIRES. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So, the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check:

Star1: m=15.5: both can see.

Star3: m=15.5: both can see.

Star5: m=15.0: both can see.

So, the options include:

B) Star3 and Star5: both can be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star1 can be detected by both; Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So, according to this, the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Yes.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the brightness limits of the two spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Apparent \( m = 15.5 \), which is ≤17 (ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (HIRES).  
   - **Both spectrographs can detect Star1.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent \( m = 16.5 \), which is ≤17 (ESPRESSO) but >16 (HIRES).  
   - **Only ESPRESSO can detect Star2.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
     \]  
   - However, the question specifies that the given apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) already includes extinction. Thus, \( m = 15.5 \), which is ≤17 (ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (HIRES).  
   - **Both spectrographs can detect Star3.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Intrinsic apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_0 = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{obs}} = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Apparent \( m = 16.74 \), which is ≤17 (ESPRESSO) but >16 (HIRES).  
   - **Only ESPRESSO can detect Star4.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent \( m = 15.0 \), which is ≤17 (ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (HIRES).  
   - **Both spectrographs can detect Star5.**

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.  
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star3**: Detectable by both.  
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.  

The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
