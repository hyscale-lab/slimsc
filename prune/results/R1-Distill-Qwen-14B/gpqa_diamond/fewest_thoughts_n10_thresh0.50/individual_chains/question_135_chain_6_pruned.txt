Okay, so I have this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but I need to figure out which particles are allowed here.

The problem gives the Lagrangian interaction term between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh, right, the bar over ψ is the adjoint spinor, so ψ_f(y) is the fermion field and the bar is the conjugate.

But wait, the given Lagrangian seems a bit off. I think the standard interaction term for a boson coupling to fermions is something like L = g ψ^† (i γ^μ ∂_μ - m) ψ X, but maybe that's not necessary here since the problem states the interaction as given.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find all possible decay modes of X into a pair of fermions. But wait, in the Standard Model, the coupling of a boson to fermions is determined by their masses. Oh, right, for scalar bosons (like the Higgs), the coupling is proportional to the mass of the fermion. So, the heavier the fermion, the stronger the coupling.

So, the decay X → f f-bar is
