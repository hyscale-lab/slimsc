Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, right? That causes a dip in brightness, which we can detect. But the probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says we have two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, if they're the same radius but different masses, does that mean something about their size? Or maybe their luminosity? Not sure if that's relevant here.

The main thing is the transit probability. I remember that the probability P of a planet transiting is given by something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, more accurately, the formula is P = (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, perhaps? Because the planet's size is much smaller than the star, so R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) divided by (something else), or perhaps (R_star / a) multiplied by another factor.

Wait, I think the formula is P ≈ (R_*/ a) * (1 / (e sin i)), but wait, no, that's for the RV method. For transits, the probability depends on the geometry. The planet has to be in the right orbital plane for us to see the transit. The formula I remember is P = (R_*/ a) * ( (1 + R_p / R_*) ), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, we can approximate it as P ≈ (R_*/ a). Or wait, perhaps it's (R_*/ a) multiplied by some other factor.

Wait, another approach. The area of the sky where the planet's position relative to the star allows a transit is a certain fraction. The probability is proportional to (R_*/ a), because the star's size is R_*, and the orbital distance is a. So
