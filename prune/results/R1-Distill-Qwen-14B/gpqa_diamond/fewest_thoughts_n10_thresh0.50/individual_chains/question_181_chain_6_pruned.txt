Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let me see. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly, and how that affects the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two specific energy bands. 

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun generates energy. The pp-I branch produces positrons and neutrinos, right? And the pp-III branch is a part of that. Oh yeah, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 ions into helium-4, producing more protons and neutrons. But wait, wait, actually, the main pp chain is pp-I, then pp-II, and pp-III? Or maybe pp-III is another part... I think the pp chain has different branches depending on the conditions, like density and temperature.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in the pp chain reactions, particularly in the steps where positrons are emitted. For example, in the pp-I branch, one of the reactions is the beta-plus decay, where a proton turns into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the Sun come mainly from these beta decays, which are part of the pp chain.

If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what part of the neutrino flux would be affected? Well, the pp-III branch is a part of the overall pp process. If it stops, maybe that particular source of neutrinos is
