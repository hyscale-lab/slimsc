Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of it (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The problem is about photometric observations that show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots in and out of view. But the interesting part is that this could look similar to an exoplanet transit, which makes the star's brightness dip as the planet passes in front. 

The question is asking: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if there were no spots), what radius would the hypothetical exoplanet need to have relative to the host star?

Hmm. So, the key here is comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit. Because when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is due to the planet blocking some of the star's light. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a variation because when they're facing us, they're dimmer, so the total brightness decreases.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. When a spot is on the visible hemisphere, the total light we receive decreases because that area is cooler and emits less light. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is due to the spots' effect. The problem states that this situation can resemble an exoplanet, which blocks some light as it transits. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

So, the amplitude of the signal for the exoplanet would be the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. For the spots, it's the area of the spots times their brightness difference.

Let me break this down.

First, the star's radius is Rstar = R_sun.

The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) since it's one hemisphere. Wait, no. Wait. No, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So that's 0.2 * ( (π R²)/2 ) = 0.1 π R². 

But wait, actually, each spot is a certain size, but the filling factor is the total area covered. So perhaps it's simpler to compute the total area covered by spots regardless of hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * ( (4π R²)/2 )? Wait, no. The star's total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R²
