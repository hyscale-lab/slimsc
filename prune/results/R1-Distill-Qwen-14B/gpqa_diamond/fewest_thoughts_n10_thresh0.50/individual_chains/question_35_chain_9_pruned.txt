Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. So, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The problem gives me a matrix representation of the operator Ay and asks about its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's break it down.

First, the problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write that matrix out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0 ] ]

Then, Ay = c * S, so substituting c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, actually, maybe I should compute it correctly. Let me compute each element:

The (1,1) element is 0 * c = 0.

(1,2) is -i * c = -i * (h/(4π)).

(2,1) is i * c = i * (h/(4π)).

(2,2) is 0 * c = 0.

So the matrix Ay looks like:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues from a 2x2 matrix.

The general form for a 2x2 matrix is [[a, b], [c, d]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the equation (a-λ)(d-λ) - bc = 0.

So for Ay, a is 0, d is 0. b is (-i h/(4π)), and c is (i h/(4π)).

So plugging into the characteristic equation:

(0 - λ)(0 - λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0.

Simplify this:

λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ] = 0.

Wait, (-i)(i) equals (-i^2)= -(-1)=1. Because i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i)= -i^2= 1.

So the term becomes (1)*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the equation is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So solving for λ: λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, because sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Are these the eigenvalues of Ay? Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, the matrix S is given, and Ay is c*S. So when I find the eigenvalues for Ay, the eigenvalues of S would be the same as the eigenvalues of Ay, scaled by c.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of S first, then multiply by c.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues directly for Ay.

Wait, let's go back to the matrix Ay:

[0, -i c ]
[i c, 0 ]

Where c = h/(4π).

The trace is 0. The determinant is [ (0)(0) - (-i c)(i c) ].

Compute determinant: (0) - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

Which is - [ (-i)(i) c² ].

(-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1, because i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1.

So the determinant is - [ (1) * c² ] = - c² * (1) → determinant is -c².

Wait, but wait: the determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc.

In this case, a=0, d=0. So ad=0. bc is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( -i^2 ) c² = ( - (-1) ) c² = (1) c².

So determinant is 0 - (1 c²) = -c².

Thus, the characteristic equation is λ² - (trace) λ + determinant = 0 → λ² + (-c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ± c.

So the eigenvalues are ± c, which is ± (h/(4π)).

So, the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, let's check.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the
