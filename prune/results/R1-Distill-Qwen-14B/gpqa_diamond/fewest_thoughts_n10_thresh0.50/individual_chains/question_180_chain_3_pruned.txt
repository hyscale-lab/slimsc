Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has charge 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to movement due to mass. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy between point charges contributes to the system's energy. Since the system is isolated, I think we're considering the electrostatic potential energy here.

Let me think about the setup. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so let's call that charge Q. The other 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is at a distance r = 2m from Q.

Wait, no, correction: the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is a distance r = 2 m from the fixed charge.

Each charge is 2e, so the charge at P is Q = 2e. Each of the other 12 has charge q = 2e and are located at r = 2 m.

So the
