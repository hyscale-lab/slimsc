Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we need to apply Einstein's theory of relativity. 

First, let's parse the question. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity doesn't work the same way as in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities don't just add up linearly when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. I think the formula for adding velocities relativistically is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of their speeds divided by some factor. Let me double-check the formula.

So, if astronaut A is moving at v1 and astronaut B at v2, both in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, because when you change frames, you have to use the Lore
