Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral, with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate and choose the right one.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal structure? Oh right, a rhombohedron is a three-dimensional figure formed by six rhombi. In crystallography, a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal and all angles equal. So in this case, all the a, b, c lattice parameters are the same, and each angle is 30 degrees. So the lattice is like a cube that's been skewed.

The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along one lattice parameter. So if the edges are a, b, c, all equal, then the interatomic distance is the edge length, right? So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, sometimes the lattice constants are given as a, and the angles, but I think in this question, the interatomic distance is given as a. So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, interplanar spacing for a crystal plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula 1/d = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) * (some factor involving the angles). Oh wait, no, that's for a cubic system. But for a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit different because the angles between the lattice vectors are not 90 degrees.

I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma) - 2(hl \cos\beta) - 2(kl \cos\alpha) ) } }

Wait, but all the angles are 30 degrees here, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So that simplifies things a bit.

So for (111)
