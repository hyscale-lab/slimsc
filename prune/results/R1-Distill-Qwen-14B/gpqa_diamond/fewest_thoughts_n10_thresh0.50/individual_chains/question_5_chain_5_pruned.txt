Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector for a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar when a linear operator is applied. So, the operator here is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the problem provides the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Let me jot those down. P_x is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the XZ-plane, so the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I think. Oh wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, right. So any direction in the x-z plane would have φ (the azimuthal angle) as either 0 or π, depending on positive or negative x. But since it's arbitrary, maybe I should think in terms of general θ.

I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, like the muon here, the spin operator along a direction n is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. So the operator P along n is (P · n) = (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). 

Since the direction is in x-z, n_y must be zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Wait, no, wait. Wait, usually, a direction in the x-z plane would have its y-component zero. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z). But because it's on the unit sphere, n_x² + n_z² =1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then in spherical coordinates, the position vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since we're in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So the operator
