Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using something called the Miller indices and some formula involving the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals are a bit tricky because all the angles are the same, right?

The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a'. So I think a = 10 Angstrom here. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So this makes the structure a bit symmetric.

The problem is asking for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² sin² α + k² sin² β + l² sin² γ)/(a²) + ... Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral systems because the angles are all the same.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h sin α + k sin β + l sin γ)^2 ))
