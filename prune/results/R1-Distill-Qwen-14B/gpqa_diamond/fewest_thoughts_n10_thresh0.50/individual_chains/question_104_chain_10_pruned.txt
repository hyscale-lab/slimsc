Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected a shift in their spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. I recall that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, the inclination of the orbit, and the mass of the star.

The formula I think is something like: velocity amplitude K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) × (1/(2π)) × ( (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) ) × ( (sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Oh, right, for exoplanets, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So that simplifies things.

I think a simplified version of the formula is K ≈ ( ( (G * M_planet ) / (c * M_star^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) × (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ) × ( sin i )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), the (1 - e²) part becomes 1, so it simplifies more.

Wait, I think another approach is better here. The RV signal (K) is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) * (1/(P^(1
