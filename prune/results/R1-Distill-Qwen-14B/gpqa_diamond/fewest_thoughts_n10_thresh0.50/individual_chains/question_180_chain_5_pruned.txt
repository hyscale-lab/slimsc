Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let's see.

So, here's what I understand from the problem. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And they're saying the system is isolated, so I guess that means energy won't be exchanged with the environment. Also, the masses are negligible, which might not matter much here.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. I'm thinking these 12 are arranged in some way around point P.

I remember that the potential energy of a charge in an electric field is given by U = qV, where V is the electric potential at the point where the charge is placed. But wait, since all these charges are identical and the same sign, they're all repelling each other. So the potential energy here would be due to the interactions between them.

Wait, since the 13th charge is fixed at P, the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So for each of these 12 charges, they're placed 2 meters from P, which has a charge of 2e. So each of the 12 charges at 2m from P would feel a repulsive force from that fixed charge. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think we're looking for the potential energy of the system when all the charges are placed as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 are fixed at 2m from P.

Wait, no, because the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so their positions can't change relative to P. That means their potential energies due to the fixed charge at P are fixed. But also, the 12 charges themselves interact with each other. Oh right! Because each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but how are they arranged with respect to each other?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, so maybe we can assume that the 12 charges are arranged
