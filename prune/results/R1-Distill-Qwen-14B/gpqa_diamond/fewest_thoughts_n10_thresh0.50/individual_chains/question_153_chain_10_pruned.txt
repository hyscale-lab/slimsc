Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break this down.

The problem has three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with their own set of reactants and conditions. I need to determine the major products for each and match them to the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is A.

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a diester of malonic acid. I think it's a good nucleophile because it's a strong, resonance-stabilized enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the Michael addition should occur here. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, how does the addition go? The enolate has a negative charge on the alpha carbon, which attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. That should form a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but wait, looking again, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, maybe the structure is actually CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the 3 position. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- as the ester. So, 3-position would be on the CH2 part? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached. Let me think: E-configuration means the groups on each side of the double bond are opposite. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me write it as CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, that's (E)- configuration. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each side would be the p-tolyl group on C2 and the carbonyl on
