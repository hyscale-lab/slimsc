Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially because of its close analog. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, I'll try to identify what each substance could be.

Starting with the reaction between X and Y. It's a violent reaction, releasing gas W. The gas molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about gases that meet that condition.

If W has equal protons and neutrons, the molecule could be something like NH3 (no, wait, that's not a gas with equal protons and neutrons). Wait, maybe H2O? No, because H2O is H and O. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, that's a gas but not sure about the neutron count. Alternatively, CO2? No. Wait, let's think about molecules where each atom has equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, if W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons, then each atom is of an element where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, carbon-12 would have 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Or maybe hydrogen, but H is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule itself has an equal number of protons and neutrons in total. Wait, perhaps the molecule's formula has a ratio where the total protons equal total neutrons.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. Let's check. CO2 has each CO2 molecule. C has 6 protons, 8 neutrons (since C is usually C-12, with 6 protons and 6 neutrons, but wait, wait, 6 protons and 6 neutrons would make 12, but that doesn't fit with the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, no, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps W is a gas where
