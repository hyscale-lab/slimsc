Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is carbon, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, and N is nitrogen. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so X=0, N=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Oh wait, that doesn't make sense. Did I do that right? Maybe the formula is C8H9NO, so for degrees of unsaturation, let's see: each double bond or ring is +1, each triple bond or two rings is +2, etc.

Another way: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Oh wait, I think I missed the +1 for N. So DoU is 5. So that's 5 degrees. That could be, for instance, a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus a double bond and a ring (but wait, the benzene is already 3). Alternatively, benzene (3) plus another double bond (1) and a ring (another 1?), but that might not add up. Or maybe a benzene ring and an amide group? Or something else entirely.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H-NMR is:

9.72 (t, 1H) – that's a triplet, maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. Wait, but here it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's an alpha proton to an aldehyde, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group.

6.98 (d, 2H) – that's probably aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests either substitution or conjugation. For example, para-substituted benzene rings have protons that are doublets. Like if you have a substituent on the benzene, the protons across (ortho and para) would split into doublets.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another aromatic doublet. Maybe another set of aromatic protons, perhaps in a di-substituted ring, or maybe in a ring that's part of a conjugated system, like a naphthalene or something else.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an -OH group? Or maybe it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic with some coupling but appearing as a singlet. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton coupled with something else in a way that the splitting isn't observed clearly, leading to a broad signal. Alternatively, maybe these are protons next to an aldehyde group, like in an enol or something.

3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet, 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester or something. Or perhaps an OCH2 group.

The reagents used are: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization. That's
