Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, right? And the light is also moving in the same direction as the beam, so I think the beam's direction is towards the observer as well. Or wait, no, the beam is propagating toward the observer because the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, maybe I should clarify: the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, so the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the beam. So when the glass moves, the light is emitted from the glass towards the observer, and the glass itself is moving towards the observer as well.

But the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So the speed of the light within the glass depends on the glass's motion, I suppose. But glass's motion would be in the same direction as the light's movement. So perhaps it's similar to the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait. In special relativity, when you have velocities, you can't just add them normally. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, but in this case, the speed of
