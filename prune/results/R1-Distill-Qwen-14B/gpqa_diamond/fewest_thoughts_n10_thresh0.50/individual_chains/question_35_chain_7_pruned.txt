Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the angular momentum operator. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, so first, what's the operator Ay? Let me write down the matrix S. So S is:

[ 0    -i ]
[ i     0 ]

Then, Ay is c times S, so c is h/(4π). So, Ay matrix is:

[ 0  -i * c ]
[ i c  0 ]

Wait, substituting c = h/(4π), so Ay becomes:

[ 0        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0 ]

But maybe I should just keep it as c for now when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Eigenvalues of Ay: To find them, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So the determinant of [ -a   (-i c) ]
                   [ (i c)   -a ]

Which is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(i c) = a² - (i c)^2. Wait, wait, no, because the product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i c)(i c). Let me calculate that.

Wait, the off-diagonal terms are (-i c) and (i c). So their product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c². What's (-i)(i)? i squared is -1, so (-i)(i) is -(i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) * c². So the determinant is a² - (c²)(1) = a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Therefore, a = h
