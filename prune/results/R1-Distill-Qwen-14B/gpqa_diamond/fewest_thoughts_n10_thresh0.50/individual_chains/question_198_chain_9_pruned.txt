Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what it's asking.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Also, the stability constants (β) for the different complexes are provided: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So, the complexes with higher β will dominate. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands attached. So the species would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue ones, which I think corresponds to the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex. Because I remember that the different complexes of Co(II) with thiocyanate have different colors. For example, the hexaammine is pink, but the dithiocyanate is blue. So the question is, out of all the Co species present, what fraction is the blue one.

So, the first thing I need to do is model the different species of Co in solution. Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate in different stoichiometries. The possible complexes are:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)²+ (monothiocyanato)
- Co(SCN)₂²+ (dithiocyanato, blue)
- Co(SCN)₃²- (trithiocyanato)
- Co(SCN)₄^2- (tetrathiocyanato)

Wait, wait, actually, I think the charge might be different. Let me think: each SCN- is -1. So, when it binds to Co²+, the charge of the complex would be:

- Co²+ + n SCN- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2
