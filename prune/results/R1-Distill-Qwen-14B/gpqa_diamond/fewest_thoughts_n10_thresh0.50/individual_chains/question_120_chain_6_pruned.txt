Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax and star distribution? Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star (d) is inversely proportional to the parallax (p), so d = 1/p. Units-wise, parallax is in parsecs, right? So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and vice versa.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution here probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let me think about how that relates to parallax.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, their density (n) is constant. Let's say in the galaxy, the number of stars per cubic parsec is n. Now, I need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax interval (like a range of plx) depends on plx. Wait, maybe I should think about the volume as a function of parallax.

The parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So for a given parallax range between p and p + dp, what is the corresponding distance range? Since p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. Or rearranged, dd = - d² dp. Hmm, but since we're dealing with positive quantities, I can just take the absolute value. So the distance interval is d^2 dp.

But wait, the volume element in three dimensions. Oh right, the volume between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd. Because it's a spherical shell, with surface area 4πd², and thickness dd.

But the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd. But n is constant. So the number of stars between d and d+dd is proportional to d² dd.

But since we're interested in the number of stars per unit parallax interval, let's express this in terms of p. Since p = 1/d, d = 1/p. So let's substitute d in terms of p.

First, the number of stars between p and p + dp would require expressing d in terms of p. So, d = 1/p, so substituting into the volume:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd).

But what is dd in terms of dp? Since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're taking the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign.

So, substituting dd = (1/p²) dp into the number of stars expression:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait: the number of stars is n * 4π d² dd. Substituting
