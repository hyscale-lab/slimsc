Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. 

Let me start by understanding the setup. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, I know that in quantum mechanics, the operator for momentum (like angular momentum) along a specific direction is given by a combination of these components. 

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So, the direction is somewhere between x and z axes. So, the vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? I'm not too sure, but I think it's often parameterized with θ from the z-axis. So, if θ is 0, it's along the z-axis, and θ=90 would be along x. So, n is in the x-z plane, so any direction can be described by angles θ and φ. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, I think. Wait no, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so the direction vector
