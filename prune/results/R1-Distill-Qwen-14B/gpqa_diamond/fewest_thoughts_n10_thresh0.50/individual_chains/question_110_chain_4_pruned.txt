Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through the question carefully.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key point is understanding the brightness each instrument can observe. From the problem statement, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So, the star's apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because if the magnitude is brighter (smaller number), it's easier to detect. So, if a star's apparent V is 17 or less, ESPRESSO can see it. HIRES can see up to 16 V mag, meaning apparent V <16. So, any star that is brighter than 16 (<=16) can be seen by both, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17.

Wait, but I need to be precise. Let me restate the limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. So, apparent V <=17. HIRES can
