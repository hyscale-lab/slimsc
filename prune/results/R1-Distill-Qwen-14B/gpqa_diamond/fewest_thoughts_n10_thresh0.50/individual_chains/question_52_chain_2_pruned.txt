Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes—no spots versus spots.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the Saha equation, which deals with ionization and excitation in stellar atmospheres. The Saha equation relates the number of ions in different energy states to the temperature and other factors. Oh wait, but in this case, it's about two energy levels of neutral Ti, so maybe it's about the Boltzmann equation instead. The Boltzmann equation determines the population of different energy levels in thermal equilibrium (LTE).

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 > E1, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is lower, 5500 K, compared to 6000 K without spots.

Wait, but wait. The effective temperature is the average, but the spots are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, does that mean the rest of the surface is hotter than 6000 K? Because the overall Teff is lower. Hmm, but the question says when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So I think
