Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring, but in a relativistic context. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when the mass is at the equilibrium point, moving through the center. But with relativity, I guess things get more complicated because of the speed limits, right?

Wait, wait. Let me get the basics right. In the classical case, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. The kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0) is maximum, so KE_max = (1/2)kA². Then, the maximum speed v_max can be found using KE = (1/2)mv², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C, but wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't just use that.

Oh right, relativity comes into play when velocities approach the speed of light. So I should probably use relativistic mechanics here. Relativistic kinetic energy is given by KE = (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), it's
