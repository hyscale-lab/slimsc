Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The dibromo part means there are two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions.

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. Oh right, KOH is a strong base. When dibrominated compounds are treated with a base, especially vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), they undergo an elimination reaction to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. Wait, but this is 1,3-dibromo. So would elimination still happen? Because for E2, the two leaving groups need to be anti-periplanar, and in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the geometry allows that. So elimination would form an alkene. That would make product 1 a diene perhaps, but wait, in this case, maybe it's a single elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation. Each Br is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So each Br would leave, and two adjacent Hs would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, maybe? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings in a chair-like formation. The 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So when you eliminate two Br atoms, you form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. Let me think about the structure. Wait, no, elimination of two Br would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but considering the adamantane structure, maybe it's 1,2-diene? Or perhaps it's a diene in a different position. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a more substituted double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the product. When KOH is used in elimination, especially in such a rigid structure, the product is probably an alkene
