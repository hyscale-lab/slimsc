Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but in this problem, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both positive x-direction.

Wait, no, the problem says 0.6c and 0.5c. So astronaut A is 2m mass at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c. So from astronaut A's perspective, what's the speed of astronaut B? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. So I think we're looking for the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

So using the relativistic addition formula: Let's say we're in astronaut A's frame. Then astronaut B's speed would be (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of B in the lab frame, and v is A's speed in the lab frame.

Wait, no,
