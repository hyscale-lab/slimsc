Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct products of some Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

First, the question describes three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and reagents, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I have to match these products with the options given.

Let me break down each reaction one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ A**

I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, dimethyl malonate is a good source of an enolate because it's a strong, stabilized enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, how does the Michael addition work here? The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the acrylate has a structure where the carbonyl is at position 3 (since it's 3-p-tolylacrylate). The acrylate is (E)-configured, so the substituents (p-tolyl and methyl) are on opposite sides.

When the enolate attacks, it adds to the beta position (the one next to the carbonyl), which would be the second carbon. So, the structure would link the two compounds. The product would have the malonate part connected to the acrylate.

Wait, but dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it deprotonates, it forms an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Let me clarify: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-(CO
