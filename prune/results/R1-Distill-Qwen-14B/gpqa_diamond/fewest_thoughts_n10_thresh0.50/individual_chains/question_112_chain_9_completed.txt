Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection, so that's like the standard basis for spin-1/2 systems.

The question is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix is given by Aij. Wait, the elements Aij are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Oh, so that's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. 

Oh wait, that's the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So our A is (hbar/2) times σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

But wait, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, maybe the eigenstates can be found by diagonalizing σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively, multiplied by hbar/2.

Wait, but the operator A has eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), right? Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become ±hbar/2.

But the problem says to find the probability of the particle being in each eigenstate of the operator A. So I need to project |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates.

Wait, but first, the state |alpha> is given proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me figure out the normalization first. The state is given as proportional, so I need to normalize it.

The state vector is a = (1+i, 2 - i). So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Let's compute that.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.
So total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Let me write this as |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, the eigenstates of A (which is (hbar/2)σ_x) are |+x> and |−x>, where:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. So, let me find coefficients c_+ and c_- such that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

Substituting the expressions:

(1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me group the |up> and |down> terms.

|up> [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ] + |down> [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] = |up> [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] + |down> [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ]

So setting the coefficients equal:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2)   ...(1)
(2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2)   ...(2)

We can solve these two equations for c_+ and c_-.

Let me add equation (1) and (2):

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_-) + (c_+ - c_-) ] / sqrt(2)
(3)/sqrt(7) = (2 c_+) / sqrt(2)
So 2 c_+ = (3 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(7)
c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

[ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_-) - (c_+ - c_-) ] / sqrt(2)
( (1+i-2 +i) ) / sqrt(7) = (2 c_-) / sqrt(2)
( (-1 + 2i) ) / sqrt(7) = (2 c_- ) / sqrt(2)
So 2 c_- = ( (-1 + 2i) ) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) ) )= [ (-1 + 2i ) ] / ( sqrt(14) )

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / (14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.64286. So about 0.64.

Compute |c_-|^2: sqrt( (-1 +2i) ) squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )=1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2 is 5/(14) ≈ 0.35714. Hmm, but wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). So |c_-|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

So probabilities are approximately 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357).

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Checking the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. Hmm, 9/14 is about 0.6428, which rounds to 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approx 0.36. So A could be a possibility.

Option C: 0.28 and 0.72. No, that's reversed and doesn't match.

But wait, wait a second, I think I may have made a mistake here. Because the operator A is (hbar/2)σ_x, so its eigenvalues are ±hbar/2, right? But the problem says to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So that would be the probabilities of each eigenvalue, which correspond to the eigenstates.

Wait, but when I expressed |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, the coefficients c_+ and c_- give the amplitudes, so the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2. So 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, let me compute 9/14: 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's very close. But let me think about the average value of operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, and |alpha> is in the eigenbasis of σ_z, perhaps using expectation values would be easier.

Wait, the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x. So expectation value is (hbar/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

But σ_x can be written as |up><down| + |down><up|.

So, <sigma_x> = <alpha| ( |up><down| + |down><up| ) |alpha> 

Which is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) ) (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this.

Let me represent |alpha> as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, sigma_x is [ [0,1],[1,0] ].

So, <sigma_x> is the expectation value of sigma_x, which is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by [ [0,1],[1,0] ] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute it as <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

So compute (alpha_dagger) σ_x (alpha).

Which is ( (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) multiplied by (0 1; 1 0) multiplied by ( (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

Multiplying the matrix σ_x with alpha gives [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, the inner product with alpha is (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7).

So,

Term1: (1-i)(2 -i) / 7
= [ (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ] /7
= [2 -i -2i + i^2 ] /7
= [2 -3i -1 ] /7
= (1 -3i)/7

Term2: (2 +i)(1 +i) /7
= [2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i^2 ] /7
= [2 + 2i +i -1 ] /7
= (1 +3i)/7

So sum of term1 and term2: (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. The probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are about 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, 5/14 is about 0.3571. But option A is 0.64 and 0.36, so it's close.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.643, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is about 0.3571, which rounds to 0.36.

So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36, with the average value hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. That matches.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match. Option B: probabilities 0.54 and 0.46, which is about 5/9 and 4/9, but that's not matching 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait another thing, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857, and 5/14 is 0.35714. So the first probability is 9/14, which is about 0.643, and the second is 5/14, about 0.357. So the options must have these. But the options given are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7

D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7)

Hmm, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the c_+ and c_-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving for c_+ and c_-.

Wait, let's re-express the equations. Equation (1): (1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2)
Equation (2): (2-i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2)

Let me write a system:

Equation (1): c_+ + c_- = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation (2): c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So adding them:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) 
= (3) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from (1):

2 c_- = [ (1+i) − (2 −i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i −2 +i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / ( sqrt(14) )

So, |c_+|^2 is [3^2]/(14) =9/14 ≈0.6428.

|c_-|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. But the options have 0.64 and 0.36, which is correct for 9/14 and 5/14.

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the \( z \)-projection of spin. First, we normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \). The norm is computed as:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Since \( A \) is proportional to \( \sigma_x \), its eigenstates are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we write:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
\]

where \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are coefficients to be determined. Substituting the definitions of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we equate coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) to solve for \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \). After solving, we find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively. Computing these:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

Next, we compute the average value of \( A \). The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
