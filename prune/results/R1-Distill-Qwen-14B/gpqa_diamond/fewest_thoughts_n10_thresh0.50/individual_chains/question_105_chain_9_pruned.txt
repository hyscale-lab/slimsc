Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots cause periodic brightness variations. The setup is such that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet when looking at the light curve. The question is, what radius of an exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

Hmm. So the problem is comparing the photometric variations caused by a planet transiting the star versus the variations caused by stellar spots. I need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar that would give the same amplitude of brightness change.

First, let's understand what each scenario does to the star's light. For a planet, when it transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. For spots, the situation is a bit different because the spots are cooler regions. When the star rotates and the spots come into view, the brightness changes because the spots are darker than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. Oh, wait, no—it says one hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20%. So maybe each hemisphere has a certain fraction covered, but only one hemisphere is spotty. Hmm. Wait, the problem says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of that hemisphere. But each hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) = 0.2 * (2π R²) )= 0.4 π R².

But wait, when considering the brightness variation due to rotation, how much of the star's surface is covered by spots that are facing us as the star rotates. Since the star is rotating, the spots come in and out of view. For a star with a single hemisphere covered, perhaps the variation is
