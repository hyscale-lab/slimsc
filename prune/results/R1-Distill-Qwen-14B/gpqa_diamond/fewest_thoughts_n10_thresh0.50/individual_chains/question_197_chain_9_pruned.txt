Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI to give a final product. We're given IR and NMR data, and four options to choose from.

First, I'll try to analyze the spectral data to figure out what compound X is. Then, I'll think about what reaction happens when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in some kind of substitution or elimination reaction, maybe a type of dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, no, I think red phosphorus is often used in the Hofmann elimination or maybe in the preparation of alkenes from haloalkanes. Oh wait, when you have a halogenated compound reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it's more about dehydrohalogenation, like in the formation of alkenes via the Hoffman elimination or something similar. Or maybe it's a situation where an acid is formed?

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests the presence of either O-H or N-H groups, but considering the other peaks, maybe it's an O-H. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could indicate a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an O-H group.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but a broad peak could also be an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like an aldehyde. Hmm. Let me think. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they are usually broad because they're exchangeable. So the 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid
