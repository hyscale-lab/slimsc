Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. It says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming ideal pH and temperature of 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The problem is about the dissociation of that complex into calcium ions. The key here is probably the dissociation constant, K. K usually tells us about the extent to which a complex dissociates.

Wait, the given K is 5x10^10. Since K is a large number, that suggests the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low, I think.

The problem states it's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Stochiometric probably means it's a 1:1 ratio. So, each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. The complex dissociates as CaY²+ ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

But wait, when they say the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that means the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY²+] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that
