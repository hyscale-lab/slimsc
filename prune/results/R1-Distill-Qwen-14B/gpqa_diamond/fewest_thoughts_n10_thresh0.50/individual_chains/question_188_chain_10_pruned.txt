Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, not too familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with specific values.

Wait, I remember that interplanar distance in crystals is calculated using something called the Bragg equation or maybe the interplanar spacing formula. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosβ) + 2(hl cosγ) + 2(kl cosα) )^(1/2) ), but wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Or maybe it's another approach because rhombohedral systems have specific properties.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal system? Or are they part of the cubic system? No, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, I think. Because in cubic systems, all angles are 90 degrees, but in rhombohedral, the angles are all equal but not 90. So, in rhombohedral, alpha = beta = gamma = some value, which in this case is 30 degrees.

I think the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is a bit different. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)( (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) )/(1 - cosα cosβ cosγ + ... ) ) ) Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait another approach. The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula: d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cosγ) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosα) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = theta, which is 30 degrees here
