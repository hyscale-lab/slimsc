Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read through it again.

So, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to our Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, it causes brightness variations that can be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking: If the star wasn't covered by these spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So, essentially, comparing the brightness dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots.

I remember that the brightness variation due to a planet is calculated using the transit method. The formula for the depth of the transit (delta F) is given by (Rp/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect disk and the star is a point source. But wait, that's only when the planet blocks some of the star's light. However, in this case, the dark spots are causing a dip in brightness as they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, no, actually, when the star has spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots being in or out of view as the star rotates. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star's overall brightness decreases. So the star's brightness varies because parts of it (the spots) are dimmer than the rest.

So the observed brightness variation from the spots would be a dip. The amplitude of this dip would depend on the area of the spots and how much dimmer they are compared to the rest of the star.

Let me think about the two scenarios. In the first case, the star has spots, so when a spot is on the side facing us, it contributes less light. The total flux from the star would be lower. The change in flux would be based on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

In the second scenario, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block a part of the star's light, leading to a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the area blocked, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the question says that the star has spots, but the setup
