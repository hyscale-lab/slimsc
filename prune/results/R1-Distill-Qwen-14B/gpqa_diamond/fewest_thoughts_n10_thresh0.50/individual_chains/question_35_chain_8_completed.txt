Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. From what I remember, the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, like an electron but heavier) would be similar to the electron's. So the possible values are like spin-1/2 particles.

The problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down what S looks like. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So matrix S is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Wait, that's familiar. Oh right, S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Let me think, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, S here looks a lot like the Pauli y matrix multiplied by i or something. Let me compute it.

The Pauli y matrix is:
[0  -i]
[i  0]

Yes, exactly. So S is actually the Pauli y matrix. So S = σy.

But wait, the operator Ay is c times S. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. But wait, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So a is the eigenvalue.

But wait, since S is σy, and σy has eigenvalues ±i, wait no, wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me think:

The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. But wait, wait, σy is actually anti-Hermitian because σy† = -σy. Oh wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. Wait, let me check.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so σy† = σy. So S is Hermitian. So when we find the eigenvalues of S, they should be real. Hmm, but wait, S is σy, which is Hermitian, so yes.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S. So let me think about the eigenvalues. Let's compute the eigenvalues of S first.

The eigenvalues for the Pauli matrices are ±1, but let me confirm that. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, so the trace is 0 and determinant is -1. The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 = (trace)^2 - 4 det, but wait no, the characteristic equation is λ^2 - tr(S) λ + det(S) = 0. For S, tr(S)=0, det(S) = (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So det(S) =1.

So the equation is λ² +1 =0 => λ² = -1 => λ = ±i. Wait, but that's impossible because S is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. Wait, this can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recalculate the determinant of S. The matrix S is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0.

So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = i² is -1, so -i^2 is +1. So determinant is 1. Trace is 0. So equation is λ^2 -0λ +1=0 → λ^2 = -1 → λ=±i. But that's not real. That can't be, because S is Hermitian, so eigenvalues should be real. Am I making a mistake?

Wait, wait, S is not Hermitian. Let me check. The Hermitian condition is S† = S. S† is the conjugate transpose. So original S is:

Row1: 0   -i
Row2: i    0.

Conjugate each element:
Row1: 0   i
Row2: -i   0.

Transpose rows and columns:
So S† is:

Row1: 0   -i
Row2: i    0.

Wait, that's the same as S. So S is Hermitian. Because S† equals S. So the eigenvalues should be real. But I just calculated them as ±i, which are imaginary. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in computing the determinant.

Wait, determinant of S. Let me compute again.

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = i^2*(-1) → i^2 is -1. So - (i^2) is +1. So determinant is 1.

So the characteristic equation is λ² +1 = 0. So λ = ±i. But that's impossible because S is Hermitian. So what's wrong here.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of S. Let me think again. The problem statement says the first row is (0, -i), the second row is (i, 0). So that's correct. So how come S is Hermitian but eigenvalues are imaginary?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the Pauli matrices. Let me think about σy. The Pauli y matrix is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

Which is the same as S. So σy is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real. But when I computed, I got λ² = -1. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant.

Wait, let me compute the determinant of S again. For a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], determinant is ad - bc.

So a=0, d=0, b= -i, c= i.

So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - [ -(-1) ] → because i^2 is -1. So, it's 0 - (1) → determinant is -1? Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, let me compute bc: b is -i, c is i. So bc = (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1)=1. So determinant is 0*0 - bc = 0 -1 = -1.

Ah, I see. Earlier, I thought the determinant was 1, but it's actually -1. So the characteristic equation is λ² - tr(S) λ + det(S) = 0. Since tr(S)=0, and det(S)=-1, equation is λ² - 0 + (-1) = λ² -1 =0 → λ² =1 → λ=±1.

Ah, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are ±1 for S. So since Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay are a = c * (±1) → ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to directly match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but our a is real, because c is real and S has real eigenvalues. So eigenvalues of Ay are real: ±h/(4π). So any option suggesting imaginary parts would be wrong.

Option B: The eigenvalues' imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That can't be right because our a's are real, so imaginary parts are zero.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Wait, for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenfunctions of Sx, Sy, Sz can't all be the same, but the eigenfunctions of S^2 and any S component are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay would be eigenfunctions of S^2 as well because S^2 is the square of the spin operator, which is diagonal. So for a spin-1/2 particle, S^2 has eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 * s(s+1), where s=1/2, so 3ħ²/4. So any eigenstate of Ay would also be an eigenstate of S^2, which is A² since A= c S, so A^2 = c² S^2. So for eigenfunctions of Ay, they are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So which option says that? Let's look.

Option C says that phi is an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. Wait, phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, which is S_y multiplied by a constant. Since S² and S_y don't commute, the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of both S² and S_y? Wait, no. For angular momentum, if you have an eigenstate of S_y, it's not an eigenstate of S_z or S_x, but it is an eigenstate of S². Because S² commutes with all S_i. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay (which is c S_y) would also be eigenfunctions of A² = c² S². So option C says that phi is an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. Wait, but if it's an eigenfunction of S_y, then it's not an eigenfunction of S_z, right? Because they don't commute. So the statement in option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think it's incorrect because the basis functions are the eigenfunctions, but perhaps phrased differently. But more on that later.

So back to the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), right? Because c is h/(4π), and the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So a = c * (±1) → ±h/(4π). So all the options need to be checked.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because our eigenvalues are real.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Also incorrect.

So the only possible correct statements are in options C and D.

Option C: Phi can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As discussed earlier, that's correct because S_y and S_z don't commute, but S² commutes with S_y.

Option D: Phi are the basis functions. Hmm. I'm not entirely certain, but the eigenfunctions of an operator form a basis for the space of functions the operator acts on. Since Ay is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis for C^2. So D's statement is correct in that sense. But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about the problem. So the question is, during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So let's think about each option:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay (which is S_y) are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is S² scaled) but not of Az (S_z). So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, I think the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the space. So in this case, the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space.

Wait, but the statement in D is: the eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps the meaning is that phi forms a basis for the domain of Ay, which is a vector space. So yes, that's correct. So which of the options, C or D, is correct?

Wait, but perhaps D is more about the basis of the matrix representation. The matrix operator is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for C^2. So when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors are the basis. So D's statement is correct.

So now, which option is correct: C or D.

But the question is about what you would consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem.

The problem asks which statement is correct DURING the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C: Phi can be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct because eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S² but not of S_z.

Option D: Phi are the basis of the operator's matrix. That's probably correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space.

So which of these statements is correct during the calculation?

Wait, during the calculation, you find the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct. But the other statement in C is also correct. So I need to see which statements are correct.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But the options are exclusive, so likely only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the eigenvalues again.

Wait, earlier I thought the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts would be wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct options must be either C or D.

Now, looking at the options again, option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² is S², which commutes with S_y, so any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². But they won't be eigenstates of S_z, since S_y and S_z don't commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. Well, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so that's correct. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps both are correct, but which one is an option.

Wait, looking at the options, both C and D could be correct. But let's see the options again.

Wait, the question is whether the statement is correct during the calculation. So during calculation, you'd find that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². That would support option C.

Alternatively, the statement in D is more about the basis, which is a general property, so D is always correct regardless of the operator.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one is an option. Let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Correct.

So which one is correct?

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the matrix representation. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are two-dimensional vectors, which form a basis for the space. So D's statement is true.

So both C and D could be correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because finding that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² is something you'd consider during the calculation.

Alternatively, D is a statement about the basis, which is a general fact. So during the calculation, you might not think about whether they're basis functions, but rather find the eigenvectors. But perhaps D is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answers.

Looking again at the options, the correct statements about the operator Ay. So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of Ay (S_y) are eigenfunctions of S² (A²), but not of S_z (Az). So that makes option C correct.

And for option D, the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So matrix Ay is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for C^2. So D is correct.

So which of these is an option in the question?

The options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both seem correct. But looking back at the question, the first part asks during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So during the calculation, you might realize that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is a different operator but commuting with Ay. So that's option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π).

So the possible a's are real. So options A and B are incorrect.

Which leaves us with options C and D.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Yes, because A² is S², which commutes with Ay. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But they do not commute with Az, so the eigenstates are not eigenstates of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space (2D), so that's correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both are correct, but only one option is correct as per the choices.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because when you're calculating the eigenvalues of Ay, you'd also note that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is another operator. So that's something you'd consider during the calculation.

So the correct answer would be option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, as \( S^\dagger = S \). Its eigenvalues are real and can be found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \).
   - The trace of \( S \) is 0, and its determinant is \( -1 \). The characteristic equation is:
     \[
     \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm 1.
     \]
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) correspond to the eigenvectors of \( S \). These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{C}^2 \), meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can serve as the basis functions for the operator.

3. **Commutation Relations and Other Operators:**
   - The operator \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (since \( S^2 \) commutes with \( S_y \)), meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A:** The imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

- **Option B:** The imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \).  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Option C:** The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).  
  This is correct because \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \), but not with \( A_z \).

- **Option D:** The eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).  
  This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for \( \mathbb{C}^2 \).

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct statements. However, the question asks which statement is correct **during the calculation** of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Option C directly relates to the properties of the eigenfunctions that would be relevant during the calculation, such as their relationship to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \). Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer: C**
