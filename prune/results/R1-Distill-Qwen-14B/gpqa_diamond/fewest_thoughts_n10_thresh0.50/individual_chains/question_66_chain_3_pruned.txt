Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries.

Wait, what's the question again? It's asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each one.

First off, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory, it should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. And the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Poincare is a separate symmetry here. Because if the theory is Lorentz invariant, and it's a relativistic theory, then it's also Poincare invariant. But wait, do the SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Or is it automatically included? I'm not entirely sure. I might need to think more about this.

Then there's CP symmetry. I remember that the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of the CKM matrix and things like the Cabibbo angle, but wait, no, actually the Standard Model doesn't conserve CP globally. For example, the CKM matrix has complex phases leading
