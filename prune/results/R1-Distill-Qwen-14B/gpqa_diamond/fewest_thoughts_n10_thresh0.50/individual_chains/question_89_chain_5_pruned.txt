Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the initial reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Looking at the NMR and IR data, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet between 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and a triplet at 1.94 ppm (2H).

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure. When you treat dibromides with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, you usually get elimination. But since it's a dihalide, maybe it undergoes a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is actually vicinal? Because 1 and 3 are adjacent in adamantane?) react with a strong base like KOH, they can eliminate twice. So, elimination of HBr twice would form a double bond. But wait, is that possible in adamantane structure? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is a strong base, so more likely elimination.

Wait, let's think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the structure is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, then elimination could form a double bond, but I'm not sure about the structure of adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal dihalide, but no, 1 and 3 are different positions.

Wait, another approach: looking at the IR. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.
