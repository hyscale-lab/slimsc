Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question is saying that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. 

But wait, the actual scenario is that there's no exoplanet, just spots. The question is asking, if instead there was a planet causing the same brightness variation (same amplitude), what would the planet's radius be compared to the star's radius?

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit causes the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but the star has spots, which are cooler. The spots would cause a dip when they're in front because they're darker. The planet would block some light, causing a dip too. But the star's overall brightness is affected by the spots and the planet's transit. So I think we need to model both scenarios and set their brightness variations equal.

So first, let's figure out the brightness variation due to the spots. Then, figure out what planet radius would cause the same dip when transiting.

I remember
