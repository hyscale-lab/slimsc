Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

The options given are A to D. Hmm.

Wait, so all the particles are identical and each has a charge of 2e. Oh, wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that, so 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs, which is 3.2e-19 C each.

The system is isolated, so no external fields are acting on them. But since the 13th charge is fixed at point P, the other 12 are at a fixed distance from P. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.

Potential energy in a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each from infinity to their position, right? And since the system is isolated, we don't have to worry about external fields, so each charge's potential energy is due to the others.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed. So for the system's potential energy, I need to consider interactions between the fixed charge and the others, as well as the interactions among the 12 moving charges.

Wait, but since the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, their positions are fixed relative to P. So each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So the fixed charge is at P, and the other 12 are each at radius 2m from P.

So the setup is like this: the 13th charge is fixed at the center, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, each at 2m from P.

Now, to find the minimum energy of the system. Hmm. So the potential energy of the system is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but since it's an isolated system, and the 12 charges are fixed in place, the potential energy comes from the interactions between all pairs.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But since the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe I can compute it in parts.

First, let's break it down into two parts: the energy due to the interactions between the fixed charge (at P) and the 12 charges at 2m, and the energy due to the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

So U_total = U1 + U2, where U1 is the energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and U2 is the energy among the 12.

Let me calculate each part.

First, U1: The fixed charge at P is 2e. Each of the 12 charges is 2e and located at 2 meters away.

The potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.98
