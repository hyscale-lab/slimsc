Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (beta) tell us about the tendency of a metal ion to form a complex with ligands. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (I think that's Co with two SCN ligands) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the structure here? So, the complexes are presumably Co(SCN)_n. The beta values are for each complex: β1 for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-? I think the order of beta increases up to a point and then maybe decreases, but in this case, beta3 is the highest (63). Wait, but beta4 is 16, which is lower than beta3. So the most stable is the [Co(SCN)3]- complex.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, blue is a color often associated with the [Co(SCN)6]^3- complex, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the blue refers to a specific complex here. Oh, wait, the question says "dithiocyanato" which I think implies two SCN ligands. Oh wait, no, wait. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- groups? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps in the context, the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)2]^+ complex. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So dithiocyanato probably means two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^+ or [Co(SCN)₂]^{x}. Wait, the charge would depend on the oxidation state of Co and the ligands. Co is II, so each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Because Co²+ plus 2*(-1) from SCN- gives 2-2=0. So the complex would be neutral.

So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)₂], and the beta given is β2=40.

But wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species. So the species include the free Co²+ and all the complexes from n=1 to n=4. So I need to find the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)₂] complex.

To find the distribution of Co among the different complexes, we can use the concept of the formation of complexes in solution. The formation of each complex depends on the stability constants (beta), the concentrations of the ligand (SCN-), and the concentrations of the metal ion.

The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex stepwise. But since there are four complexes here, it's a bit involved. Alternatively, we can calculate the fraction of each complex using the given stability constants and the concentrations, and then sum them up.

Wait, but the problem gives four beta values. Let me think about how the beta values are defined. For each complex, βn = [Complex]/([Co] [SCN]^n). So for each n, the concentration of the complex is given by βn multiplied by [Co] multiplied by [SCN]^n.

But in reality, [Co] here is the free Co²+ concentration. So all the complexes are formed from the free Co²+ by adding n SCN- ions.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But that's the total, including all species: free Co²+ and all the complexes.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So that's the sum of all Co species: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but I think that's not correct. No, wait, the total cobalt concentration should be the sum of all the species. So each complex contributes to the total Co.

So, the approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex, sum them all plus the free Co²+ concentration, and then find the fraction of the desired complex (in this case, [Co(SCN)₂]).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model the system by considering the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion, using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

So, let's denote the free Co²+ concentration as [Co]. Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * [Co] * [SCN]
[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2
[Co(SCN)3]^− = β3 * [Co] * [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)4]^2− = β4 * [Co] * [SCN]^4

But wait, the stability constants are given for each complex, so βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So the formula for each complex's concentration is correct.

But wait, the stability constant βn is for the formation of the complex from Co²+ and n SCN- ions. So:

βn = [Complex]/([Co²+][SCN-]^n)

Therefore, each complex's concentration is [Complex] = βn [Co²+] [SCN]^n.

So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co²+:

Total Co = [Co²+] + β1 [Co²+][SCN] + β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2 + β3 [Co²+][SCN]^3 + β4 [Co²+][SCN]^4.

Wait, but that's a bit complex because [Co²+] is a common factor. Let me factor that out.

Total Co = [Co²+] * (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

We know that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So,

[Co²+] * (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ) = 1e-2.

We can compute the term in parentheses first. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

β1 = 9,
β2 =40,
β3=63,
β4=16,
[SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term for n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β2 [SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum these:

1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So the term in parentheses is 2.3646.

So,

[Co²+] * 2.3646 = 1e-2 => [Co²+] = (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, let me compute that. 1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

So [Co²+] ≈ 0.004225 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex can be found as:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co] [SCN] =9 *0.004225 *0.1.

Let me compute each:

Co(SCN)^+:
9 *0.004225 =0.038025; times 0.1 is 0.0038025 M.

Co(SCN)₂:
β2 [Co][SCN]^2=40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2.

40 *0.004225 =0.169; (0.1)^2=0.01. 0.169 *0.01=0.00169 M.

Co(SCN)3^-:
63 *0.004225 * (0.1)^3.

63 *0.004225=0.266175; (0.1)^3=0.001. So 0.266175 *0.001=0.000266175 M.

Co(SCN)4^2-:
16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4.

16 *0.004225=0.0676; (0.1)^4=0.0001. 0.0676 *0.0001=0.00000676 M.

Wait, so the concentrations are:

Co²+ :≈0.004225 M.

[CoSCN]^+ :≈0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)₂] :≈0.00169 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^-:≈0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2-:≈0.00000676 M.

Now, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂], which is the dithiocyanato complex. So the concentration is 0.00169 M.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, in the options, the percentages are around 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%. Let me see.

Wait, let me sum all the concentrations to make sure.

Sum = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

0.004225 + 0.0038025 = 0.0080275; plus 0.00169 → 0.0097175; plus 0.000266 →0.0099835; plus 0.00000676 →≈0.00999026 M.

But wait, the total Co is supposed to be 0.01 M. But according to these numbers, the sum is about 0.00999 M, which is 0.01*(approx 99.9%). The discrepancy is due to rounding during calculations. So our approximations are close enough.

So the [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.00169 M.

The percentage is (0.00169 / 0.01) *100 =16.9%.

Wait, but the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So it's option D)16.9%.

But wait, did I calculate correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, the [Co(SCN)₂] is 0.00169 M, the total Co is 0.01 M.

0.00169 / 0.01 =0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation of [Co(SCN)₂].

β2 is 40. [SCN]^2 is 0.1^2=0.01.

So [Co(SCN)₂] =40 * [Co²+] * 0.01.

Wait, [Co²+] is 0.004225.

So 40 * 0.004225 = 0.169.

Multiply by 0.01 gives 0.00169. That's correct.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the stability constants are given as cumulative or stepwise. Wait, wait. Are these beta values stepwise or cumulative?

Wait, in this problem, the way it's set up, the beta values are for each successive step. For example, β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)₂^0, etc. So each beta is the stepwise constant, so the calculations as done are correct.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- SCN⁻ concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]
- The complexes are:  
  \[
  \text{[Co(SCN)]}^+, \, \text{[Co(SCN)}_2]^0, \, \text{[Co(SCN)}_3]^-, \, \text{[Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-}
  \]

### Approach:
1. **Stability Constant Formula**:  
   The concentration of each complex is given by:  
   \[
   [\text{Complex}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   where \( \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the \( n \)-th complex.

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Factoring out \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \), we get:  
   \[
   c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
   \]

3. **Calculate the Term in Parentheses**:  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + (9 \times 0.1) + (40 \times 0.1^2) + (63 \times 0.1^3) + (16 \times 0.1^4)
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Solve for \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \)**:  
   Using \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \):  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Concentrations of All Complexes**:  
   Using \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), calculate the concentration of each complex:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \times 0.004225 \times 0.1 = 0.0038025 \, \text{M}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times 0.004225 \times 0.1^2 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times 0.004225 \times 0.1^3 = 0.000266 \, \text{M}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times 0.004225 \times 0.1^4 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}
   \]

6. **Percentage of Dithiocyanato Complex**:  
   The blue dithiocyanato complex is \( \text{[Co(SCN)}_2]^0 \), with concentration \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 0.00169 \, \text{M} \).  
   The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \).  
   The percentage is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{c(\text{Co})} \times 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**.  
**Answer: D**
