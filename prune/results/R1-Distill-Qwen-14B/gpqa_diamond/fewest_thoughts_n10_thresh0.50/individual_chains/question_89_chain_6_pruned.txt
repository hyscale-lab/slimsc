Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through the question and see what's going on.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-shaped molecule. So, 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two opposite vertices of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. In elimination reactions, when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, in adamantane, the structure is a bit different. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's not a vicinal dihalide, but maybe each bromine is on a bridgehead carbon.

Wait, when you heat a dihalide with KOH, especially in a situation where elimination is possible, it might form an epoxide? Or wait, no, elimination would form an alkene. But with two bromines, perhaps an elimination happens twice, but since they're not adjacent, maybe each bromine leaves, and the molecule loses two HX molecules, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons.
