Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says that two stars have the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are about the same mass. The orbits are circular, so eccentricity isn't a factor here.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is than Planet #1's.

Wait, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, K. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the inclination of the orbit (which is 90 degrees if it's edge-on, which is the best case), and the orbital period.

The formula I remember is K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M_planet/M_star)) ), but since M_planet is much less than M_star, that denominator is approximately 1. So K is proportional to (v) which is related to the orbital speed of the star.

Wait, but another formula I think is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period. The shift in the spectral line depends on the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital period. So higher K (bigger velocity shift) could mean either a more massive planet, a shorter orbital period, or a closer orbit.

But in this case, the planets have the same mass, so the difference in K must be due to other factors. Hmm, but wait, the formula for K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1
