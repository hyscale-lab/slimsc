Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (d = 1/plx). So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, 0.5 parsec would be 2 parsecs away, and so on.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, so it's like how many stars are there for each slice of parallax value. Let's say we look at a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars would we expect in that range?

I think this has to do with the volume of space at a certain distance. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume. But wait, how does parallax relate to volume?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as parallax decreases (because the star is farther away), the distance increases. So if I have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by dr. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume of the shell is
