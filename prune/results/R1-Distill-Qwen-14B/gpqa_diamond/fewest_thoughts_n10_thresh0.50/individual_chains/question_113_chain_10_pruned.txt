Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. So, the unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from these techniques will help determine its formula among four options.

First, let's break down each piece of information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says it's a very broad peak, which makes me think it's O-H. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, often a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But then there's another peak at 1650. I remember that conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents can affect the carbonyl peak. For instance, if the compound has an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1740, so maybe not. Wait, 1700 is more like a ketone or possibly an ester. Wait, but esters usually have a higher carbonyl peak, around 1740. So maybe this is a ketone. But then the 1650 peak could be another functional group. Maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, like an aromatic ester or something else. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide or maybe an olefin (alkene) C=C stretch. Wait, but the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present.

So the FTIR suggests possible O-H (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and another peak maybe for an alkene (1650). Wait, but wait. The 1650 might not be the alkene. Because alkene C-H stretches are usually around 3000-3100, which is the broad peak here. Oh wait, no, the broad peak is at 3000. So that's more O-H. The 1650 peak is
