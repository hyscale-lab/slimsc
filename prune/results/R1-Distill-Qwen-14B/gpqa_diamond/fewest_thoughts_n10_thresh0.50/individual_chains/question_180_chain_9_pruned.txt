Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about electric potential energy, which I remember from my studies, but it's been a while. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so no external forces are doing work on it, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P?

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from P? So all 12 are at the same distance from P? That would mean they form a sort of sphere around P, but maybe I don't need to think about their spatial arrangement. Because the question is about the minimum energy of the system, which has to do with electric potential energy.

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. The formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j, and the sum is over all pairs i
