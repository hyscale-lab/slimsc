Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let's think through each option.

First, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method to handle these infinities, then you take the cutoff to infinity or remove it somehow. But some theories don't need this because they're already finite, right?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me go through each one.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electromagnetism as described by Maxwell's equations, right? It's a classical theory, so it doesn't involve quantum mechanics. Since it's classical, maybe it doesn't require regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So D could be the answer, but wait. Classical theories don't have the same divergences as quantum ones. Oh wait, but in reality, classical electromagnetism does have issues with things like the self-energy of charges, but those are handled in the classical context, perhaps with other methods. But in the quantum realm, when you quantize it, you get QED, which does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED is renormalizable. So when you calculate loops, you get divergences, but you can absorb them into counterterms through renormalization. So QED does use regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So it requires regularization. So C is not the answer.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, deals with quarks and gluons. It's also a quantum field theory. Wait, but I've heard that QCD becomes strongly coupled at low energies, which is why quarks are confined. But in high-energy (or asymptotic) limits, QCD becomes weakly coupled, so perturbative methods work. But wait, about regularization. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, and it's also renormalizable. So like QED, it requires regularization because of loop divergences. So B is not the answer.
