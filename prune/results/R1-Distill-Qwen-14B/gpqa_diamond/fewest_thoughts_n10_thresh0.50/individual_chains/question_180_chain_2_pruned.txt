Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. It says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, the charge of each particle is 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. So that's 3.2e-19 C each. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about things like kinetic energy or gravitational forces. The problem is about the minimum energy of the system, so I'm guessing it's an electrostatic potential energy problem.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has one charge, and then there are 12 charges all at a distance of 2 meters away from P. So, in effect, these 12 are arranged in a sphere around P, each at 2 m.

Wait, but how exactly are they arranged? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, they could be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m centered at P. But their exact arrangement might not matter because when calculating the potential energy between point charges, the total potential energy depends on the sum of the potentials each contributes.

Now, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm. Since the system is isolated, the total energy is the sum of the electrostatic potential energies between all pairs of charges.

But wait, the system comprises 13 charges. So, what are the interactions here? The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 charges at 2 m away will interact with this fixed charge, and also with each other.

Wait, but since the 12 charges are identical and all at the same distance from P, perhaps the potential energy can be broken down into two parts: the energy due to the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges, and the energy due to the interactions between the 12 moving charges themselves.

Let me structure this:

Total Potential Energy (U) = U_fixed_interactions + U_self_interactions

Where U_fixed_interactions is the potential energy between the fixed charge
