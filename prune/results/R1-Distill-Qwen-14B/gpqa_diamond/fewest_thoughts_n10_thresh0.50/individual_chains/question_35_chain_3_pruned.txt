Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll think this through.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is given with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the statements A to D is correct.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators like S (which is spin here) have components that satisfy certain commutation relations, but since this is a 2x2 matrix, it must be for spin-½ particles, like electrons or muons. So S here is probably the spin operator divided by something. Wait, wait, the operator is A_y = c·S. Let me write down the matrix S first.

Matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So A_y = c * S, c is h/(4π). So A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by S.

Eigenvalues of A_y will satisfy the equation A_y |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue.

Since S is a 2x2 matrix, I can compute its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of S are ± something. Let me calculate the eigenvalues of S first.

The characteristic equation for S is det(S - λI) = 0.

So:

| -λ      -i     |
| i      -λ     |

= (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i²) → i squared is -1, so λ² - (-1) → λ² +1 = 0. So λ² = -1 → λ = ±i.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y = c·S will be c*i and c*(-i).

Substituting c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues a are:

a = (h/(4π)) * i and a = -(h/(4π)) * i.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention this. Let me check each option.

Option A says the
