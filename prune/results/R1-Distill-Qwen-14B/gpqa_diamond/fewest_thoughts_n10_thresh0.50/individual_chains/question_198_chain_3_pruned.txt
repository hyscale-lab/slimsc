Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the various cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ligands. So, the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^n+ or something like that. But what's the charge of the complex? Well, Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So if it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, that makes sense. Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2-? Hmm, not sure about the charge, but maybe it doesn't matter for the calculation here.

Stability constants are given for four complexes. Let me list them:

β1 = 9 → probably Co(SCN)
β2 = 40 → maybe [Co(SCN)_2]
β3 = 63 → [Co(SCN)_3]
β4 = 16 → perhaps [Co(SCN)_4]

Wait, but the complexes are ordered by the number of SCN- ligands. So, the first complex has one ligand, the second has two, etc. But wait, are the β's in order from lower to higher? Because β3 is the largest here (63). So, the more ligands, the higher the stability constant? That would make sense because higher β means more stable.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So, that's the complex with two SCN- ligands, which is β2=40. So, I'm looking for the fraction of Co species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

The problem is about the distribution of Co between different complexes. So, we have free Co^2+ ions and various complexes. The total
