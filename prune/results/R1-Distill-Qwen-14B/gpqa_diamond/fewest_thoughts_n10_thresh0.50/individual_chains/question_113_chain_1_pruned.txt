Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the problem again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, all with C6H something O or O2.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might suggest a strong hydrogen bonding, which is common in -OH groups. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Let me think: carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, yes. Also, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is a strong one, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe an amide or something else, but that's less likely since the options don't have nitrogen.

So combining the IR data: broad O-H (maybe a carboxylic acid), and a strong C=O at 1700. Wait, another peak at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or something with a carbonyl group next to an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 1650 might be from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. But then why the 1700?

Wait, for a carboxylic acid, the O-H is broad, and the C=O is around 1700. But what about another group? If the 1650 is another C=O, perhaps it's a conjugated system, but in a carboxylic acid, I don't think there's another strong C=O. So maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an ester? Ester's C=O is around 1740, but wait, in this case, the 1700 is lower. Hmm, maybe it's a ketone? Or maybe an
