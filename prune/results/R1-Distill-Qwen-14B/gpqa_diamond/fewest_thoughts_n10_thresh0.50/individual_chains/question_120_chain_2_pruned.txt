Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars' distribution and how their number changes with parallax. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about parallax and star distribution.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star's position shifts in the sky as the Earth orbits the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. Right, so parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think I need to find how the number of stars (let's say N) depends on plx. The options suggest different power laws, like 1/plx^1 or 1/plx^2, etc.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in space according to the question. So uniform distribution in space would mean that the number density of stars is constant in all directions. But when we observe them, their distribution as seen from Earth (in terms of parallax) won't be uniform because of the geometry involved.

I remember something about the volume of a sphere. The number of stars within a certain distance should depend on the volume, which is (4/3)πr³. But since we're considering a range of parallax, let's think about how many stars are between plx and plx + dplx.

Each star at a distance d (so plx = 1/d) contributes to the count. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, let's say n. So the number of stars at a distance between d and d+dd (which corresponds to plx between plx and plx + dplx) would be the surface area at that distance multiplied by the volume element and the number density.

Wait, surface area is 4πd², and the volume element is 4πd² dd (since you're considering a thin spherical shell). But wait, in terms of parallax, how does this translate? Since d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, because derivative of d with respect to plx is -d/(plx^2). So when plx increases, d decreases.

So the number of stars N between plx and plx + dplx would be n * (number of stars in that shell). The number in the shell is n multiplied
