Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice science question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of the flux between two energy bands after a certain reaction stops. Let's break this down step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. So, I need to find the flux ratio of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy via proton-proton fusion. The pp-III branch is a specific part of this chain. Oh right, the pp-I branch produces mainly positrons and neutrinos, and the pp-II and pp-III produce higher-energy neutrinos, maybe? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III must contribute to the production of higher-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos should drop. But wait, the question is about the ratio of two bands. Let me think about the neutrino energies from different branches.

I recall that the pp-I and pp-II reactions emit neutrinos with lower energies. For example, the main pp-I reaction produces 1.022 MeV neutrinos. The pp-II branch produces some with higher energies, maybe around 5 MeV or so? And the pp-III branch goes even higher, perhaps up to 14 MeV, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, no. Let's get this right. The Solar neutrino spectrum is dominated by several distinct peaks. The first is around 0.5 MeV from the pp-I branch. Then, the pp-II branch produces neutrinos in the 1-5 MeV range. The pp-III branch, which is a continuation of the pp-II, produces even higher energy neutrinos, maybe up to 14 MeV. So, if the pp-III stops, then the production of those higher-energy neutrinos (like above maybe 5 MeV) would stop.

But the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Wait, 0.7 to 0.8 MeV and 0.8 to
