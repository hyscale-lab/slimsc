Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember from my studies that relativistic speeds involve some special formulas. 

First, I need to understand what the nucleus is. Oh, the problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 4 neutrons normally, but this one has 3 neutrons instead. So wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the standard isotope of lithium has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, making it Li-7. But if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 + 3 protons? No, wait, no. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no. The element Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. The number of neutrons can vary. So if X is Li with 3 neutrons, that means it's lithium-6 (since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons). So the mass number A is 6. So X is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So I think I need to calculate the relativ
