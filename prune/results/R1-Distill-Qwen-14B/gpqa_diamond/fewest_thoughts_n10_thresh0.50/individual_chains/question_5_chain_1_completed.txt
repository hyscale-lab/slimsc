Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

Wait, the operator is P, and we're looking for an eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, the operator is a vector operator, which usually makes me think of spin operators. Oh wait, the components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, each as (ħ/2) multiplied by some 2x2 matrices.

So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by some angle θ, maybe. But wait, the eigenvector will correspond to the spin state along that direction. So the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem says, what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? So the eigenvector is a two-component vector, probably for a spin-½ system, like a muon which is a spin-½ particle.

Let me think about how to approach this. The operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator P would be the sum of the components P_x, P_y, P_z multiplied by the respective direction cosines. Wait, no, actually, the operator in the direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So, P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, or is it from the x-axis? Hmm, perhaps it's more common to use θ from the z-axis, so direction in x-z plane would mean n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because when θ=0, it's along z, and θ=90 would be along x.

So, the operator P·n would then be (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z). Because n_y is zero.

Let me write down the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So, the operator P·n becomes:

P·n = (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z)

Substituting the matrices:

= (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Now, adding the matrices:

The (1,1) element is cosθ*(1) + sinθ*(0) = cosθ.
The (1,2) element is sinθ*(1) + cosθ*(0) = sinθ.
The (2,1) element is sinθ*(1) + cosθ*(0) = sinθ.
The (2,2) element is cosθ*(-1) + sinθ*(0) = -cosθ.

Wait, no. Wait, the matrices are:

First term matrix for sinθ: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Second term matrix for cosθ: [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when you add them:

element (1,1) is 0 + 1 = 1 --> multiplied by sinθ and cosθ respectively? Wait no, wait: no, the first term is (sinθ) times the P_x matrix, which is (ħ/2) times the matrix. Oh wait, no, the P_x matrix is (ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]], so when we compute P·n, it's (sinθ) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when we factor out (ħ/2), we get:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Adding those matrices:

First matrix (from sinθ):

0 1

1 0

Multiply by sinθ: each element multiplied by sinθ.

Second matrix (from cosθ):

1 0

0 -1

Multiply by cosθ: each element multiplied by cosθ.

Adding together:

Element (1,1): cosθ*1 + sinθ*0 = cosθ
Element (1,2): sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 = sinθ
Element (2,1): sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 = sinθ
Element (2,2): cosθ*(-1) + sinθ*0 = -cosθ

So the combined matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, but that's multiplied by (ħ/2). So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So the matrix we have is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
           [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Which is, substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the system of equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these as:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1 ) b =0

These are two equations. Let me write equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)

Equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

I can write this as a system:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ      ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ      (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

The determinant of the matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = ?

Let me compute:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin²θ

Multiply out (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1)
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1
= -cos²θ + 1

So determinant is (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ.

Wait, wait, no: determinant is (cosθ-1)(-cosθ-1) minus (sinθ)(sinθ).

So, (cosθ-1)(-cosθ-1) = ( -cos²θ -cosθ + cosθ +1 ) → simplifies to (1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ.

So determinant = sin²theta - sin²theta = 0.

Which it is, because we're looking for an eigenvector. So that's consistent.

So now, from equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)

Let me solve for a in terms of b (or vice versa). Let's write equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Hmm. Let's see, perhaps I can express a in terms of b. Let me factor out a negative sign:

Denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ )

So,

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

Simplify the fraction sinθ/(1 - cosθ ). I remember that 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Alternatively, a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * b.

So, let's express a as [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ] * b.

Let me let b = k (some constant), then a = [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ] * k.

But since we're looking for a normalized eigenvector, the constants can be determined up to a phase.

Wait, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T.

So, let's write a = [cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2)] b.

Let me express it as:

a = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] * b

So, let me choose b = sin(theta/2) * e^{i phi}, then a would be cos(theta/2) * e^{i phi}.

Wait, but phi is arbitrary because the eigenvector is only defined up to a phase. So the eigenvector can be written as:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait! Because earlier, I had a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b.

Let me let b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me check these relations. Let's see:

We had a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] * b.

Wait, let's choose b = 1, then a = sinθ/(1 - cosθ).

But from the trigonometric identities, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), and (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin^2(theta/2).

So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So a = cot(theta/2 ), and b =1.

So the vector is [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ]^T.

To make this a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

The magnitude squared of this vector is (cot^2(theta/2) + 1).

But cot^2 x +1 = csc^2 x = 1/sin^2 x.

So the magnitude is 1/sin(theta/2). Therefore, the normalized vector is:

[ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] → [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so when multiplied by sin(theta/2), it becomes cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because in the previous step, the vector was [a, b] = [cot(theta/2), 1], which when normalized becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Hmm, but let's check this.

The vector [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let's plug back into the original equation to confirm.

The operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix we constructed. Let me compute P·n |v> where |v> is this vector.

P·n |v> = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

Let me compute each component.

First component: (ħ/2) [ cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2) ]

Second component: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * cos(theta/2) + (-cosθ) * sin(theta/2) ]

Let me compute the first component:

cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) = cos(theta/2). Because cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB.

So first component is (ħ/2) cos(theta/2).

Second component: sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So second component is (ħ/2) sin(theta/2).

But the expected eigenvalue is ħ/2, so P·n |v> should be (ħ/2) |v>.

The vector after applying the operator is [ (ħ/2) cos(theta/2), (ħ/2) sin(theta/2) ]^T = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which is indeed the eigenvalue multiplied by the eigenvector. So this works.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and option D is something multiplied by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) and with some hbar. Wait, but in the given options, the eigenvector components have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar. Hmm, but wait, the way the problem is presented, the eigenvector is a vector in a 2-level system, so the components are just complex numbers, not necessarily involving hbar.

Wait, wait. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmm. So according to my calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So that's option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the operator. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator is P·n, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Because the operator is (P·n), and the eigenvalue is the expectation value, which aligns with the spin in the direction n.

Wait, but in my calculation, the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] gives the correct eigenvalue. So that's the correct eigenvector.

Looking at the options: option C matches this exactly.

But wait, another thought: the eigenvalues for spin-½ systems are ± ħ/2. So for the operator P·n, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvector I found corresponds to +ħ/2.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

Wait, but some of the options have factors with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which suggests a particular direction, perhaps. But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector must be expressed in terms of theta, not specific numerical factors.

Wait, but the options have varying forms. Option D looks like it's scaled by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But in our case, the eigenvector doesn't have any scaling beyond the trigonometric functions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the form of the eigenvector.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the operator P is a vector operator and the eigenvector should be a spinor in the direction n. So another approach is to consider the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices in an arbitrary direction.

Wait, the general form for the eigenstate of S·n (where n is a unit vector) is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

But in this problem, the operator is P, which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli vector. So the eigenstates would be the same as the spin states, just scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is exactly option C.

So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then phi is zero because the direction is along theta in x-z. So phi would be zero, making the state [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check: why do some options have factors like sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3)? Could the problem be about a specific direction, perhaps along x-z in a way that the eigenvector has those components? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which implies that the eigenvector must be expressed in terms of theta, not specific numerical factors. So the option C matches that, as it's expressed in terms of theta/2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator's components are given, and the question is about the eigenvector elements. So perhaps in this case, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But looking back, in the problem statement, the operator's components are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So perhaps the operator P is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices? Wait, because P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0 1],[1 0]], which is the same as (ħ/2) sigma_x. Similarly for P_y and P_z.

So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ), since n_y is zero.

So then the eigenstates are the same as the spin eigenstates in the direction n.

So the eigenstate for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be exp(-i phi/2) [ cos(theta/2), exp(i phi) sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But if phi is zero (since n is in x-z plane), then phi =0, so the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. Which is option C.

So the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as $(\hbar/2)$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ can be described by an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis, with $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$, $n_z = \cos\theta$, and the matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a, \quad
\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b.
\]
From these, we solve for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $\theta$. The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces specific numerical factors and $\hbar$ in the components, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This form is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$, and does not match the derived result.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector exactly.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This introduces unnecessary numerical factors and $\hbar$, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

### Conclusion
The correct normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
