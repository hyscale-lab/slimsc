Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, but this problem mentions the non-rigid rotor, which probably means it's considering some flexibility in the bond. 

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state, and what momentum a photon should have to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so when it absorbs a photon, it must go to the next higher state.

Wait, the molecule can change both rotation and vibration states. Oh, but the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm a bit confused. Does that mean the next state is a combination of both vibrational and rotational energy levels?

Wait no, the next state would be the next higher energy level overall. But how are these energy levels structured? For a diatomic, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, E_vib = (n + 1/2) h Î½, with n being the vibrational quantum number.

But in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational constant might change with vibration. But for this problem, I might just need to consider the fundamental state, which is the lowest state of vibration (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the fundamental state is n=0, J
