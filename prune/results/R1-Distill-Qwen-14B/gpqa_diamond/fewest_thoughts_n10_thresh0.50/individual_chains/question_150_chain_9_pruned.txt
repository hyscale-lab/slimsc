Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the solution step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, the molecular formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can be found using the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens (which there aren't any here), and N is nitrogens.

So plugging in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's calculate that. 2*8 is 16 +2 is 18. 18-9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5 degrees of unsaturation. Five DoU could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (3 DoU: three double bonds in the ring) plus a double bond and a ring, or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Or perhaps adjacent to a double bond.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. 

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. 

These could be aromatic protons. The doublets might suggest coupling between two sets of equivalent protons. Like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each proton has two adjacent protons (in ortho positions), but wait, no, para positions are across from each other. Hmm, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Wait, but wait, 2H eachâ€”so perhaps two doublets, each integrating 2H, like a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So maybe the aromatic ring is substituted at positions 1 and 4 with something else. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, para to each other, each substituent having their own effect on the neighboring protons.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, a singlet suggests no neighboring protons. Broad could be due to exchange with something else, maybe an OH group, but wait, an OH would typically be a broad peak, but would it be a singlet? Or maybe it's part of an enol structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be two protons that are equivalent and not split by any neighbors, perhaps due to being on a double bond.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. Possibly a methylene group (CH2) next to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. Like a CH2 connected to something like an oxygen. Could be an ether or adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and an oxygen-containing group like an ether or an alcohol.

The molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde is probably part of a longer chain. Maybe a butyl chain with substituents.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. If there's an aldehyde (CHO), maybe at one end of a chain. Then perhaps a double bond somewhere, as there are doublets in the NMR that might indicate coupling from adjacent protons.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is likely an aldehyde, but it's a triplet. Aldehydes typically are deshielded and appear as singlets, but in some cases, they can
