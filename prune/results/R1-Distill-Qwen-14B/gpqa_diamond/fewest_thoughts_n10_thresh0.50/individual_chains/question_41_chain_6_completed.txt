Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to figure out the speed of the light relative to the lab frame. Let me think.

So the setup is a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. Wait, so the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. But the beam is going towards the observer, so maybe the observer is on the other side, and the glass is moving towards them.

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the lab. So the lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is inside the glass, which has an index of refraction n, so normally its speed would be c/n, right? But wait, in the lab frame, how does that velocity add up?

I remember something about relativity. Oh wait, no, this is probably not relativistic, since the velocities are probably non-relativistic. Because if v is much smaller than c, then maybe we can use a simple velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait. Newtonian velocity addition would say that if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside is moving at v_light relative to the glass, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light + v. But wait, no—because the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. Or is it?

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam. So, the glass is moving towards the observer, which is in the direction the light is going. So, the light's velocity relative to the glass is c/n (since in the glass medium, speed is c/n). So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (c/n) + v, but wait, that can't be right because when you add velocities in Newtonian mechanics, you just add them. But wait, light's speed is always c in any inertial frame according to relativity, right? So that's conflicting.

Oh wait, that's the key point. According to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, the light is inside the glass, so it's not in a vacuum. So maybe it's different.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, what does that make the lab see?

Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about frames. If in the glass frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Then, to find the lab frame (where the glass is moving at v), I need to perform a Lorentz transformation or use velocity addition.

Wait, but Lorentz transformations are for when velocities are significant fractions of c. The problem says to take c=1, but I don't know the value of v. So perhaps we're meant to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n. But wait, no, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n, but wait, that's a speed less than c, which is okay because it's in a medium. But when you transform to the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass.

Wait, let me clarify the frames. Let me set up the frames properly.

Let me consider that the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab frame is S, and the glass's rest frame is S'. In S', the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (so same direction as v). Then, the lab frame (S) would see the light moving at u = ?

Wait, no, because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So in S', the glass is at rest, and the light is moving at u' = c/n. Then, the lab frame S is moving at velocity -v relative to S' (since S' is moving at +v in S). So, to find u in S, the velocity of the light in S, I need to use the velocity addition formula from S' to S.

The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

But wait, u' is the velocity of the light in S', which is c/n. So substituting:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator:

1 + (v/(n c)) )

So the numerator is (c + n v)/n. The denominator is (n c + v ) / (n c) ), wait, no, let's see:

Wait, denominator is 1 + (v * (c/n) ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c).

So, u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ]

Let me factor c in numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (1 + (n v)/c ) /n

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = [n c + v ] / (n c )

So, u = [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) /n ] / [ (n c +v )/(n c) ) ]

Simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel, and c cancels with c:

= [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) * c ] / [ (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, no, let me redo this step. Because:

= [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c ) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancel:

= [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

c + n v = c +n v

n c + v = c n + v

So,

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / ( c n + v )

But wait, since c is given as 1, substitute c=1:

u = [ 1 * (1 + n v ) ] / (n *1 + v )

So,

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Wait, that's option A. So the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

But wait, I thought that the speed of light should be c in any frame, but wait, in this case, the light is inside a medium, so maybe it's allowed to be less than c. Wait, but according to the calculation, the speed in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which when v is zero, gives 1/n, which makes sense because in the glass frame, the speed is c/n.

But wait, what if the glass is moving at the speed of light? That's impossible, but if v is very large, this fraction might approach something. But in reality, velocities can't reach c.

So the correct answer seems to be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light propagates through the glass with a speed \( c/n \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' \) is the velocity of the light in the glass's rest frame (\( u' = c/n \)),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory,
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum (given as \( c = 1 \)).

Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiplying numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this reduces to:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
