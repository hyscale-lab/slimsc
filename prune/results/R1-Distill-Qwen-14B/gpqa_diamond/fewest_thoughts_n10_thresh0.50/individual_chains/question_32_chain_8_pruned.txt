Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So, if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, I think. Because Li typically has an atomic number of 3, so 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make the mass number 6.

So, the first thing I need to find is the rest mass of this nucleus. The rest mass energy of a nucleus is given by E = mc². For that, I need the mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, I can calculate the total rest mass.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The mass of a proton is about 1.67e-27 kg, but in energy terms, it's 938 MeV. Similarly, neutron is about 939 MeV. So, each proton contributes 938 MeV, each neutron 939 MeV. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Calculating the rest mass energy: 3*(938) + 3*(939) MeV. Let's compute that. 3*938 is 2814, and 3*939 is 2817. Adding them gives 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, but that's for 6 nucleons. Wait, but wait, the mass of the nucleus isn't exactly the sum of the masses of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh right, in reality, the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum due to the mass defect and binding energy. So, using the exact mass of Li-6 is probably given by a specific value.

Wait, but maybe I can't remember the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe they just want me to use the sum of protons and neutrons' masses, ignoring binding energy. Or perhaps the binding energy is negligible for such a calculation, especially since it's a problem for a test, not a precise calculation.

Wait, but the problem gives the speed as 0.96c, so high energy. So relativistic effects are definitely in play here, so I can't ignore relativity.

So, the steps I need to follow are:

1. Find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Use the relativistic energy equation to find the total energy when the speed is 0.96c.
3. The kinetic energy would be the total energy minus the rest mass energy, but wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the collider. Is that the kinetic energy each nucleus has, or the total energy (rest plus kinetic)?

Wait, in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, no, I think that for heavy ions, the energy mentioned is often the kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe the total energy. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion.

Wait, I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain kinetic energy. But in the problem statement, it's asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps we need to find the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Because the total energy (relativistic) is gamma * m c², which includes the rest mass. But the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So, perhaps the question is asking
