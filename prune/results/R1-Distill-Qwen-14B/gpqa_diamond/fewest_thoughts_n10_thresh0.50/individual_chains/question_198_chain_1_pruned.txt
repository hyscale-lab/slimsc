Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it.

So the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So we're looking for the fraction of the Co species that's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Stability constants, β, are the formation constants. Each β represents the equilibrium for forming the complex. For example, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, I think the nth β is for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^2+ (monodentate?), β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. So the formation constants increase up to β3 and then drop at β4. Interesting.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible cobalt species and then sum them. The species include the free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^2+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or wait, maybe it's [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) since each SCN^- is -1. So for n=1, charge is +2-1= +1? That's [CoSCN]^+? Hmm, but wait, initial Co is Co^2+. So each SCN- adds a -1. So the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n).

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each, the nth β is the formation
