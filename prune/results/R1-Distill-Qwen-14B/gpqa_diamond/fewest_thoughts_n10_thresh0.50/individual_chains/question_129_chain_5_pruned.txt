Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending at E. There are also some hints provided, so I should probably use them to figure out the structures involved.

Let me first outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

Hmm, so each step is a transformation from one compound to another. Let me think about each reaction.

Starting with the first step: A + HCN → B. HCN is typically used in the formation of nitriles from carboxylic acids, but wait, maybe A is a ketone? Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, HCN can add to carbonyl groups. Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is an aldehyde or ketone that undergoes addition of HCN to form a cyanohydrin. Oh, wait, the product B would then be a cyanohydrin. Or perhaps A is a carboxylic acid, but then HCN would react as a nucleophile, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the hints provided. Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, a phosphorous ylide is often used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A reacts with a ylide to form that structure, that suggests that A is a carbonyl compound—either a ketone or aldehyde.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw this structure mentally. Cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1,2,4. The substituents are methyl groups at
