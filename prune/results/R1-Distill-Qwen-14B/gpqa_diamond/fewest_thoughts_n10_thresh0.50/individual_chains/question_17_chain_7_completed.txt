Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when a certain complex is present. Hmm, let's break it down.

The problem states that we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's a stoichiometric complex? Oh right, that means the ratio of the ions is 1:1, right? So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion, I think. So the formula would be like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA.

The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I remember that when a complex forms, the ions are tied up in the complex, so the free ion concentration is lower than the initial concentration. But how do I calculate that?

The given information includes the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants are for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Right.

But in this problem, the initial solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, it can release some Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But wait, if the complex is stoichiometric, then each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if the complex dissociates a bit, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would both be equal to x, where x is the amount that dissociates.

Wait, but the problem says the pH is ideal. I think that means the concentration of EDTA is controlled such that it's in the correct form. Maybe the activity is considered, but perhaps in this problem, we can ignore that and just use concentrations.

So, let's model this. Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− will each be x. So the expression for the formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) = Kf.

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, if some x amount dissociates, the complex concentration will be approximately 0.02 - x. But since Kf is very large (5e10), the dissociation x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That makes the math easier.

So substituting, Kf = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x². Because [Ca²+] is x, [EDTA] is x.

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Wait, wait, let me write that again. Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

So 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Let me solve for x. Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / (5e10).

Calculating that, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7. Oh wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, wait. Let me verify that. Let me compute 4e-13, square root.

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) ) = 2 * (1e-6.5) )= 2 * (3.16e-7) )= 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of calcium ions is x, which is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's double-check. The initial concentration is 0.02 M CaY²−. Kf is 5e10, which is a large value, so the complex is very stable. Therefore, very little dissociates, so the approximation holds.

So the equation is Kf = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x²). So x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approx 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions be \(x\). Since the dissociation is small (due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\)), the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) remains approximately \(0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
