Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, and they were found using the RV method.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in a small orbit around the system's center of mass, and this causes the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question gives me the wavelength shifts for each planet. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the planet's properties?

I remember that the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M_p/M_s)), but wait, the star's velocity is due to the planet's orbit.

Another approach: The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is K = (2Ï€ G)^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / ( (P (1 + M_p/M_s))^{1/3} ) ) * (1/(c (1 + M_p/M_s)^{2/3} )) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function
