Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different brightness limits, so the key here is to figure out each star's apparent magnitude and see if it's within both telescopes' detection ranges.

Let me start by understanding the question. The problem gives me five stars, each with different parameters like RA, DEC, absolute magnitude, distance, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent magnitude. The spectrographs can only observe stars brighter than a certain V magnitude. ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 would be observable by ESPRESSO, but only those brighter than 16 would be seen by HIRES. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both, so the star's apparent V mag must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES) because the brightness limit is the maximum they can observe. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16 mag to be detected by both, because HIRES is the stricter.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So stars with V ≤17 are observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, meaning V ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have apparent V magnitude ≤16 mag because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is fainter than 16, HIRES can't detect it, even if ESPRESSO can.

So I need to calculate each star's apparent magnitude, considering any extinction (like dust or gas in the interstellar medium which makes stars appear dimmer), and then see which ones are ≤16. Because only those would be detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes. So I think I'll have to calculate their apparent magnitudes based on their distances, and then apply the extinction.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Starting with Star1:
- Absolute V mag (Mv) is 15.5
- Distance is 10 pc.
So
