Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic velocities, you can't just subtract them normally because speeds add differently. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is needed here. Also, for energy, I think each astronaut's energy should be considered, and then maybe summed up.

Wait, the relative velocity part. So if one is moving at v and the other at u, what's their relative speed from each other's frame? I think the formula is (v - u) / (1 - (vu)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Let me confirm that. I think that's correct when the velocities are in the same direction. So v is 0.6c, u is 0.5c. So substituting:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) = 0.1c/(1-0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel =0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, the total energy part. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². For the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Calculating gamma for 0.6c:

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower, probably not accounting for the relativistic gamma correctly.

So combining the relative speed and energy, the correct option would have v_rel=0.14c and E≈5.96 mc².

Looking back, the options are:

A) v_rel=1.1c, E=mc² → No, relative speed can't exceed c, and energy way too low.

B) v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 → v_rel is 0.1c, but our calculation gave ~0.14c. So B is wrong.

C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 → Correct.

D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5 → Energy is off, because we have about 5.96.

So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v = 0.6c\) and \(u = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **A)** Incorrect: Relative speed exceeds \(c\), and energy is too low.
- **B)** Incorrect: Relative speed is \(0.1c\), not \(0.14c\).
- **C)** Correct: Relative speed is \(0.14c\), and total energy is \(5.96m c^2\).
- **D)** Incorrect: Relative speed is correct, but total energy is \(5m c^2\), which is too low.

Answer: C
