Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that each spectrograph has a different magnitude limit. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—brighter means a lower magnitude. Oh right, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V=17. Because anything brighter than that—like, magnitude 16 is brighter than 17—so yes, 17 is the limit. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So stars with V mag less than or equal to 16 can be seen by HIRES, and up to 17 for ESPRESSO. So any star that's brighter than V=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, but only if it's brighter than 16 can it be seen by HIRES.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's definitely brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it, and HIRES can see it too. So the key is to find stars with apparent V magn
