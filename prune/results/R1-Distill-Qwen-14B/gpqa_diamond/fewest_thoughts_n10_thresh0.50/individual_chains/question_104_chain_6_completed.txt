Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The idea is that the planet makes the star wobble, and we can detect that wobble through shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, milli is 10^-3, so 5e-3 and 7e-3 angstroms. But how does that relate to the orbital periods? I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star, right? Oh wait, the velocity is the same as the shift in wavelength because the shift is proportional to velocity. So a larger shift means the star is moving faster due to the planet's influence.

Wait, no, the shift is the velocity multiplied by some factor related to the wavelength. Oh right, the formula for the Doppler shift relates velocity to the change in wavelength. The formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where c is the speed of light. But in the RV method, the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is what's measured. So higher K means a larger velocity shift, which implies more massive planet or shorter period, or maybe it's the other way around?

Wait, I think the semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, and the periods are what we're comparing, perhaps the formula can be used to relate the velocities to the periods.

The formula for semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 day in seconds) )) )^(1/3) 

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star) ) * (1 / (P * sin i)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

K = ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (G / (2 pi))^ (1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relationship between K and period. Since both planets have the same mass and their stars have the same mass, and assuming the same inclination (but since they're both detected, we can assume sin i is the same for both, maybe even 1), then K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G(M_star + M_p) P^2)/(4 pi^2). Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune vs Sun-like star), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So a^3 is proportional to P^2.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3). Then the orbital velocity v is related to a and P via v = 2 pi a / P. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), v is proportional to P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3). So v is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

But wait, wait. K is the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's velocity. Since the star and planet orbit the barycenter, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p, where v_p is the planet's orbital speed. 

From Kepler's laws, v_p would be sqrt( (G M_star) / a ). Alternatively, using the formula for circular orbits, v = (2 pi a) / P. 

So putting it all together: K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (2 pi a) / (P * M_star). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

Since both planets have the same mass and their stars have the same mass, the primary variables affecting K are the period and the velocity of the planet.

The formula for K is given by:

K = [ ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

But perhaps it's easier to use the approximation that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K ∝ (M_p / M_star) * (1 / a^(1/2) ) ), but since a^3 ∝ P^2, a ∝ P^(2/3). So 1/a^(1/2) is proportional to P^(-1/3). So K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)).

So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2, and their periods are P1 and P2, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let's define it correctly. If K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)), then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, maybe it would be better to set up the ratio.

Let me define:

K1 = (some constant) / (P1^(1/3))

K2 = (some constant) / (P2^(1/3))

So K1 / K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Alternatively, if K1 = (constant) * (1 / P1^(1/3)), then K2 = (constant) * (1 / P2^(1/3)).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But since K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides. (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 ?

Wait no, wait:

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is7, so K1 =5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 =5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, that's 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 is about 0.364, meaning that P2 is about 0.364 times P1, so P2 is shorter than P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is ~0.36 times P1, which is shorter. So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be 0.36 times longer? No. Wait, no. Wait, the question is, How many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, that would be P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which would mean P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, which means it's shorter. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? Well, it's shorter, so the number would be less than 1. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is P2 = 0.36 * P1. So the answer would be A) approximately 0.36 times longer.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The setup is that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases. So higher K (like 7) would mean a shorter period. So planet #2 has a higher K, so it has a shorter period. So when they ask how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer would be less than one, which is option A.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for planets with similar masses and host stars of the same mass. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift (\( K_2 = 7 \)), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the periods can be derived as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. This means Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is **not** longer than that of Planet #1, and the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
