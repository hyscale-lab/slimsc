Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question gives the Lagrangian interaction term as L = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Oh, right, probably it's L = -λ ψ_f^† (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X is a bosonic field interacting with fermions. But I think the important part here is that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, based on the available energy and the mass of X.

First, I remember that a boson like this can decay into a pair of fermions if the combined mass of the fermion pair is less than the mass of the boson. Because conservation of energy requires that the sum of the fermion masses be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, but wait. Actually, in particle physics, the decay occurs into a pair of particles (like f and f̄) if the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to the mass of X. So, 2m_f ≤ m_X. Because the rest mass is the minimum energy required to produce the pair.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's list out the masses of the known fermions to see which can be produced.

Fermions and their approximate masses (in GeV/c²):

- e⁻ (electron): ~0.0005 GeV
- μ⁺ (muon): ~0.1057 GeV
- τ⁻ (tau): ~1.777 GeV
- u: ~0.003 GeV (so u and anti-u would be ~0.006)
- d: ~0.005 GeV (so d and anti-d ~0.01)
- s: ~0.095 GeV (so s and anti-s ~0.19)
- c: ~1.275 GeV (so c and anti-c ~2.55)
- b: ~4.13 GeV (so b and anti-b ~8.26)
- t: ~173 GeV (so way too heavy)

Wait, but wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions can be produced in pairs where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

Let's compute 2m_f for each:

- e: 0.001 < 6 → allowed
- μ: 0.2114 <6 → allowed
- τ: 3.554 <6 → allowed
- u: 0.006 → allowed
- d: 0.01 → allowed
- s: 0.19 → allowed
- c: ~2.55 → allowed
- b: 8.26 → 8.26 >6 → not allowed
- t: way too big → not allowed

So, the possible fermions that X can decay into are those with 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, which fermions satisfy 2m_f ≤6?

Let me list each:

- e: yes
- mu: yes
- tau: yes (since 2*1.777 is about 3.554)
- u: yes
- d: yes
- s: yes
- c: 2.55 ≤6 → yes
- b: 8.26 >6 → no
- t: no

So X can decay into pairs of e, μ, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: X→b
