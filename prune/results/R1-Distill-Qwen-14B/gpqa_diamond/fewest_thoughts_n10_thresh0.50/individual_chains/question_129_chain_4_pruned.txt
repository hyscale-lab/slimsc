Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four reactions in total, and we also have some hints to help us figure this out.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The options are four different cycloketones, so E is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

The hints provided are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Okay, so let me think. IR peaks are important here. The 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or maybe an ester or something else. But since in the options, E is a ketone, maybe A is a ketone too. Wait, but let me think about the reaction steps.

First, A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN is known to add to carbonyl groups, like in the formation of cyanohydrins. So A is likely a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the product would be a cyanohydrin, which is an addition product. So A must have a carbonyl group. So A is a ketone, and B is the cyanohydrin.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst. So the carbonyl group in B would be reduced. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a nitrile group. So the reaction would reduce the nitrile group? Or the alcohol?

Wait, when you have a cyanoh
