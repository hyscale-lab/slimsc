Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially the analog of X. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe a strong acid reacting with something reactive, like a metal? Or perhaps X is a strong base? Wait, but Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is water? Or perhaps something else like an acid.

The gas W released has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So W is a molecule, so likely H2O or something else. Wait, if the molecule has same protons and neutrons, perhaps it's H2O? Let's see: H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium), but that wouldn't make sense for same number. Alternatively, maybe it's something like NH3? No, wait. Wait, the molecule's atoms must have same number of protons
