Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some info about the brightness each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can handle stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, so that means the apparent V magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude needs to be less than or equal to 16 mag.

Wait, but I should double-check. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, no. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤16.

But wait, no, let me think again. The wording is a bit confusing. It says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, it's observable. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V ≤17. Because anything brighter (lower mag) than 17 is okay. Similarly for HIRES, apparent V ≤16.

So the stars need to be visible to both spectrographs. So their apparent V magnitudes must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, no. Because if a star's apparent V is, say, 15, it's brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and also brighter than 16 for HIRES. So to be detected by both, the apparent V must be ≤17 (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16). So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16 because HIRES is more restrictive. Wait,
