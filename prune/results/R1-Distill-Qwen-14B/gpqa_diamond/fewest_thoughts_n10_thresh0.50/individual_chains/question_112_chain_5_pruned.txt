Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, implying that we have to find the actual coefficients by dividing by the normalization factor.

Next, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given by Aij, where Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that doesn't sound like a standard operator. Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe it's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, but that's a symmetric matrix. So what operator has such a matrix? That would be proportional to the Pauli X operator, but actually, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are usually defined with eigenvalues ±1, but let me check: when you have a 2x2 matrix where diagonal is zero and off-diagonal is 1, that's σx. So scaling it by hbar/2, the operator is (hbar/2) σx.

Now, the eigenstates of σx are the eigenstates of this operator A. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σx. So the eigenstates of A would be |+x> and |–x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the eigenstates could be different if the operator is scaled
