Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA ion. The formation constant, K, is given, which relates to how strong the complex is.

So, the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, I guess I need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in the solution. Because EDTA forms a very strong complex with Ca^2+, the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be very low, right?

Wait, what's the formula for the formation constant? I think the formation constant Kf is defined as [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as the reverse, the dissociation constant. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So it's Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the K given is written as KCa-EDTA, but I think it's the same as Kf. So Kf =5e10.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M. But wait, wait! Wait, no. Wait, no, because in solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the concentration of each of those would be much lower.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So the initial assumption is that the majority of the EDTA is in the complex form. Because the formation constant is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal.

So, let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) for the dissociation:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

Initial concentrations:
[CaY^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca^2+] = 0
[Y^4-] = 0

Change:
Let x be the change, so [CaY^2-] decreases by x, [Ca^2+] and [Y^4-] increase by x each.

So, equilibrium concentrations:
[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca^2+] = x
[Y^4-
