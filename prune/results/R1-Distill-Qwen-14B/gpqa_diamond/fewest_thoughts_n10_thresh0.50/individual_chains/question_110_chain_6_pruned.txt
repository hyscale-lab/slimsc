Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might get a few things wrong, but I'll try to work it out.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, and HIRES is part of the Keck Observatory. The question gives some key info about their observing capabilities. ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars down to about 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag in V. So, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the fainter limit for HIRES. Wait, wait. No, wait. Because if HIRES can only see stars brighter than 16, that means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16. Similarly, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star with apparent magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 for both to detect it.

Wait, but the options might have stars that are fainter than 16, so those would only be detectable by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So I need to find stars whose apparent V magnitude is ≤16.

Wait, but each star in the options has either an absolute magnitude or apparent magnitude given. So for some stars, I'll have to calculate the apparent magnitude.

Let's look at each star one by one.

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So, absolute magnitude (M) is 15.5. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10 pc. log10(10/10)=log10(1)=0. So m =15.5 +0 =15.5 mag. So apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So HIRES can see it (since 15.5 ≤16). ESPRESSO can also see it because 15.5 ≤17. So Star1 is visible to both.

Star2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude is already given as 16.5. So m=16.5. Now, HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So 16.5 is fainter than 16. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, because 16.5 ≤17. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: RA 11h, DEC 48, apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. Oh, but wait, it's extinction given. How does that affect the apparent magnitude? Because inter
