Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. Hmm.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the reaction produces acetate ions and water. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized, forming sodium acetate.

Wait, but wait. The question is about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. I need to calculate the pH at both.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take.

1. **Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.**
   The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution can be found using M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Oh yeah, because 20/40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 = 0.025 M.

2. **Determine the moles of acetic acid and sodium hydroxide.**
   Wait, for the titration, the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially will be 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So that's 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001.

   Then, when we titrate, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume at equivalence point is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

3. **25% Titration Point:**
   25% of the equivalence point means 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Moles of NaOH added here are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

   Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles
