Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? It's quite rigid and has four tertiary carbons in a bridge-like structure.

So the first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. That should form an alkene because the base abstracts a proton, and the halides leave, forming a double bond. Wait, but wait—adamantane has a very rigid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? Because each Br is on adjacent carbons, but wait, no—wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Brs on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Hmm, are those adjacent? Because in adamantane, the structure is a bit complex. Let me think. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so each carbon is connected in a particular way. Oh, wait, if it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps they are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is used, it's a strong base and heated, leading to dehydrohalogenation. But wait, each molecule of KOH would take a proton—so probably eliminating to form an alkene.

Wait, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I recall that when alkenes are formed, sometimes they can be in a certain conformation. Also, the NMR spectrum of product 1 is given. Let's look at that. The NMR has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Wait, 4.79 ppm is probably an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or an alcohol. But product 1 is formed after reaction with KOH. Oh, wait, KOH is a base but also a strong nucleophile. Wait, in some elimination reactions, especially with dihalides, you
