Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that luminosity depends on both the radius and the temperature of the star. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, that formula should apply here.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but how does mass relate to temperature here? Oh, wait, maybe I don't need the mass for calculating luminosity directly. But wait, maybe the radial velocity comes into play. Oh, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, not sure how that's relevant yet.

Wait, the problem says they have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then they must have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's important.

So if T1 equals T2, then the luminosity ratio should depend only on the radius. Let's compute L1 over L2. Since both have the same T, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the temperature factor is 1. So L1/L2 is just (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 2.25. The options are:

A) ~2.25
B) ~2.32
C) ~2.35
D) ~2.23

So option A is exactly 2.25. But wait, did I miss something? Oh, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so maybe it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving at
