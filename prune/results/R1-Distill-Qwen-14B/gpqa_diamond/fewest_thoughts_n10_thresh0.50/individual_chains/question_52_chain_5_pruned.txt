Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, so the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

Alright, the star's properties change when spots are present. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait. So the star's effective temperature decreases because the spots are cooler, right? Because spots are darker, they absorb less light, so the star appears cooler overall.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So I guess I need to calculate the ratio before and after the spots and then find the ratio of those ratios.

In stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) and E is the energy difference.

Wait, so the ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). Because if E2 > E1, then the exponent becomes negative, so the ratio is less than one. But in the problem, when the temperature decreases, the ratio decreases. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the observed ratio of N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots. So how does temperature affect this ratio?

Let me think. Suppose the transition energy corresponds to a specific wavelength. The energy difference E2 - E1 is given by E = hc/λ, where λ is 1448 Å. So E = hc/(1448e-10 m). But I might not need the exact value because maybe I can relate the ratios using the temperatures.

So when the star is cooler (spots present), the exponential term in the Boltzmann factor is smaller, making the ratio N1/N2 smaller. Because T is lower, (E2-E1)/(kT) is larger, so the exponent is more negative, so N1/N2 is smaller. So when T decreases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T1) ), and when spots are present, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T2) ). The factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Wait, because R1 is when T = 6000 K, R2 when T=5500 K.

So the ratio R1/R2 is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

But wait, the
