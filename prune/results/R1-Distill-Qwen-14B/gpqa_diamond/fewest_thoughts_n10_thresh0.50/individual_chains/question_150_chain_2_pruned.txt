Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with a side chain or something. The NMR data is given, so that's probably the key to figuring out the structure before any reactions.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's one possibility—a carbonyl group, maybe an aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted? Because if it's a doublet, maybe two protons adjacent to substituents. Wait, but for a substituent on benzene, like in para position, each proton would be part of a doublet if there's a single substituent. No, wait, no, that's when there are substituents in the ortho positions. Hmm, maybe a di-substituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with adjacent groups, like in a vinyl group or something else.

Next, 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. If I have two doublets, maybe they're from two different coupling environments. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, but that would give a triplet if it's between two identical substituents. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other. So each set of protons would be a pair. But in that case, the protons adjacent to substituents would couple with each other, leading to a doublet. So maybe the 6.98 is from one set of para-substituted benzene protons, and 6.51 from another set.

Then, 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet and 2H—could this be an -OH group? But wait, alcohols usually show
