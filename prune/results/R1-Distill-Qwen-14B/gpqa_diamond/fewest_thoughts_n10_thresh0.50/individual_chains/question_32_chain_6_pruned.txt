Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means first.

Wait, Lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Lithium-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, right? So I think the mass of Li-6 is important here. 

The question is about the energy in the collider. Since it's a heavy ion collider, the ions are moving at relativistic speeds. The speed given is 0.96c, which is pretty high, so I probably need to use relativistic equations.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Given v is 0.96c, so let me compute that. Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So v squared over c squared is 0.9216. Therefore, 1 minus that is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So the denominator becomes 0.28, which makes gamma equal to 1/0.28. Calculating that, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is the same as 100 divided by 28, which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c^2. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is roughly 6 atomic mass units (u), since each neutron and proton
