Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me try to think this through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We're looking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal... Oh right, for a cubic crystal, the interatomic distance is the edge length, a. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal system. Or is it? No, wait, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system. Oh, right, rhombohedral is a special case where all edges are equal and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the lattice is actually a cube that's been stretched or compressed along the diagonals, making all the angles the same.

So in a rhombohedral lattice, the primitive unit cell is a rhombohedron, and the lattice parameters are a, a, a for the edge lengths, and angles alpha, beta, gamma all equal. So in this case, a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. So a = 10 Angstroms, and all angles are 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula 1
