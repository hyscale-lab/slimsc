Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions does that happen? Oh right, the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon in a ketone to form a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is between a ketone and HCN, but in this case, it's NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Wait, but wait. The product is a cyanohydrin, right? So the reagent A here must be something that provides an acidic environment to protonate the carbonyl oxygen after the nucleophilic attack. Because when the CN- attacks the carbonyl, the oxygen becomes negatively charged and needs to pick up a proton. So A probably is an acid like H3O+ or maybe something else that can donate a proton.

Looking at the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So here, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Oh, I think the typical way to do that is through hydrolysis. Under acidic or basic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids or amides, depending on the conditions.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, you might use H2O with an acid catalyst. So for the second reaction, reagent B is H2O and something else. Oh wait, the problem says reagent B is H2O. Hmm, maybe that's part of the reaction, but perhaps the reagent is the acid or base that's added along with water.

Wait, looking again: the second reaction is with B and H2O. So B is the reagent, perhaps an acid. Let me think. To convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you can have hydrolysis. Acidic conditions would typically use HCl or H2SO4, and heat. Or under basic conditions, you might use NaOH, but that would give a carboxylate which then needs to be acidified.

In this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be done under acidic conditions. So B would be an acid like HCl. Because when you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually add H2O and an acid catalyst, like HCl. So B is HCl.

So putting it together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. A must be H3O+ because the cyanide adds to the ketone, and then the oxygen picks up a proton (H+) from the acid. So in the first step, the reagent A is H3O
