Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states can be represented as vectors on the Bloch sphere, but mixed states are more complex.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, let me make sure I write that down correctly. So ρ is an average of the states |0> and |1>, each multiplied by a 1/2. That makes sense because the trace should be 1, which it is since 1/2 + 1/2 is 1.

Now, I need to think about how this density matrix corresponds to a point in the qubit space. Qubit space is two-dimensional, right? Because a qubit is a two-level system. So the geometrical representation probably involves a vector in that space, maybe in terms of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent pure states. For mixed states, the density matrix can be written in terms of expectation values. Oh, right! The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So I need to express the given ρ in this form.

Let me expand the given ρ. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1|. The |0> state is [1, 0]^T, so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together and multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]], which simplifies to [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, but how does that fit into the I + r·σ form? Let me recall that I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[
