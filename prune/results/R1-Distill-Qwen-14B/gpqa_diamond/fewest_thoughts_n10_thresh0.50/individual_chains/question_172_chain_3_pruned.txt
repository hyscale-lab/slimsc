Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about excitation in stars, it's related to the temperature and the energy levels of atoms. Oh right, this should have to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher for star_1. I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The Boltzmann factor is about the probability of atoms being in a certain energy state relative to the ground state.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, in this case, maybe we can assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars, or perhaps the ratio is the same since it's the same element. So maybe the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is what's given.

Oh wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) compared to the ground state (n_lower) is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2. So let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2.

So R1 = 2 * R2. But what's R? It's the ratio of populations, which depends on the Boltzmann factor. So R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But if both stars are considering the same transition, perhaps g_upper and g_lower are the same for both, so the ratio R depends only on the exponential term.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the energy difference between the levels is about 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is given. The question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2.

So the key here is that the ratio of the populations (n_upper/n_lower) for each star is given, and that ratio depends on the temperature of the star. Since star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2, that ratio R1 is twice R2. Or wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2.
