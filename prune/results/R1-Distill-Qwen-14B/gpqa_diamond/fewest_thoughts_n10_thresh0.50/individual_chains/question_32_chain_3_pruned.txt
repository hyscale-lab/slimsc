Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. Oh right, Li-6 has 3 neutrons because 6 is 3 protons plus 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute gamma first. So v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let's calculate that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but I should calculate this more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0
