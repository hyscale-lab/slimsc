Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when energies are high. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math blow up. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff (renormalize) to get physical results.

So the question is which of these theories doesn't require that step. Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't really deal with quantum effects, so they don't have the same infinities as quantum theories. Wait, but wait—classical theories can have their own issues, like the problem of self-energy for charges (like the idea that a charge's own electric field would push it infinitely back, leading to infinite self-energy). But in classical physics, these aren't handled with regularization and renormalization because those are quantum concepts. So maybe classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe D is the correct answer.

But let me think about the other options to be sure.

Option C: QED. I remember that QED does require renormalization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So you have to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars methods. Then you absorb the divergences into counterterms, which is renormalization. So QED definitely requires regularization, so C is not the answer.

Option B: QCD. Quantum Chromodynamics deals with the strong force. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. QCD has issues like confinement and asymptotic freedom. But when it comes to calculations, like in perturbation theory, you still get loop divergences. So you need regularization and renormalization. Wait, but is there something else? Oh, but in QCD, the beta function is negative, leading to asymptotic freedom, which makes perturbative calculations more manageable at high energies, but I don't think that changes the need for regularization. So B still requires regularization.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining general relativity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, instead of point particles, you have strings. One of the key features is that it doesn't have the same ultraviolet divergences as in point particle theories. Because strings have a size scale (the string length), which might act as a natural cutoff. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because the divergences are already tamed by the stringy nature. Oh wait, but I'm not so sure. I remember that in string theory, the loops (which are higher-order corrections) are actually finite, meaning no need for regularization. Or wait, do they? Because I think that
