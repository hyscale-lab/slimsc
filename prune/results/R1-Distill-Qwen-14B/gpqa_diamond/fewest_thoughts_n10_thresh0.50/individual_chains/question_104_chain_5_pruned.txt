Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that movement through shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the star's mass is the same for both, and the planet masses are similar.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We're supposed to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. Oh right, the formula involves the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital parameters.

I remember the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2π)/(P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since M_planet is much less than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), the M_star + M_planet is approximately M_star. So, K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (2π/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( (2π) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So this becomes:

K ≈ ( (G
