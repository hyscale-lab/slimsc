Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let's look at the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually correspond to O-H stretching. So this compound probably has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, what do those peaks indicate?

The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption. I think that's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something like that. The peak at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with C=C stretching. Wait, no, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, such as an ester group or a conjugated ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the Hs attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, maybe from an alkene group or maybe part of a ring structure. Also, the presence of vinyl Hs suggests that the molecule has some unsaturation, which would fit with the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak possibly being a conjugated system.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry part: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what that could be. The most common fragment at 45 is the CH3CO+ ion, which is the acetyl group. But wait, other possibilities exist. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is at m/z=91, so that's not it. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me calculate the molecular weight.

Wait, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So let's calculate the molecular weights:

C6H12O: (6*12)+(12*1)+(16) =72 +12 +16=100.

C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O2:72 +12 +32=116.

Hmm, but the mass spec peak is at 45. So what fragment would be 45? Let's think about possible fragments.

45 could be (CH3)2CO+ which is 58? No, wait. Wait no, another possibility: the acetylium ion is CH3CO+, which is 43 (12*2 +1*4 +16) =24 +4 +16=44? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3CH2O+? That would be 45. Because CH3CH2O has molecular weight: 12*2 +6 +16 =24 +6 +16=46. Oh wait, no, that's 46. So that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44. Hmm, not exactly 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3COO- group? No,
