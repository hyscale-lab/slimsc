Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. The options are all some kind of aldehyde or ketone, I think.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton. So, the compound probably has an aldehyde group. Aldehydes have high chemical shifts because of the deshielding effect from the adjacent carbonyl.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 6.98 as a doublet and 6.51 as another doublet. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets would correspond to the two sets of aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring. For example, each doublet has two protons, so maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups? Wait, but our formula has C8H9NO. Let's see: each benzene ring is C6H5, so if we have two phenyl groups, that would be C12, but the molecular formula is C8, so maybe that's not right. Hmm, maybe it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 → (18-9-1+1)/2 → (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right because degrees of uns
