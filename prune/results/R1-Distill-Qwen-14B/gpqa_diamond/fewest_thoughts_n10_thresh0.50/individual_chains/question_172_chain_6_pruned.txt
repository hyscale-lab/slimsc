Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means the usual statistical mechanics apply.

Wait, so when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, are they referring to the population of a higher energy level versus a lower one? I think in LTE, the population of energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations in two energy states.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is Delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E_i is the higher energy level and E_j is lower. So for star_1, the population of E_i is twice that of E_j. Wait, no, wait. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe n_i (excited) in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Or wait, maybe in star_1, the ratio is 2. Let me read it again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps, the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, no. Let me think. The problem says, "twice as excited in a specific energy level". That might mean that the population of a certain energy level (say, level 2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or maybe it refers to the excitation energy being twice as much? Hmm, not sure. Probably, it's the population ratio.

So for star_1, n1
