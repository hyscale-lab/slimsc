Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Alright, I need to tackle this in parts. Let's see. First, I think I should find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution because we're adding equal volumes of water. Then, I can figure out how much NaOH is needed for the equivalence point. After that, I can calculate the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

So, starting with the dilution. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, here M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L. M2 will be the new concentration, and V2 is 0.040 L.

Calculating M2: (0.05 M * 0.020 L) / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH, which produces the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The equivalence point occurs when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present initially.

Wait, let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid. That's Molarity * Volume. So, 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So, the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. Moles are 0.001 mol, and the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So, volume V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the problem asks about 25% titration. So at 25% of the equivalence point, how much NaOH is added? 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, during the titration, the solution will be a buffer solution before the equivalence point. At 25% titration, only a quarter of
