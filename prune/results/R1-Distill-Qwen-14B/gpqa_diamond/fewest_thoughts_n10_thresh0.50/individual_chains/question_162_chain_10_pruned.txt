Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on the form.

So, the problem is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a space with constant negative curvature, right? Like the hyperbolic space. But wait, pseudosphere can sometimes mean a 2-dimensional surface with negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But in this context, maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in 3D, or perhaps a 2D Lorentzian manifold?

Wait, no, the metric here is written in terms of dx and dy, so it's a 2-dimensional space. The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see the denominator: 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² is less than 4, the denominator is positive, and the coefficient is positive. But wait, if x² + y² approaches 4, the coefficient becomes large, which might imply some kind of singularity there.

Wait, the area of the pseudosphere. I've heard that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere of radius r is 4π(r^2) * something involving hyperbolic functions.
