Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I know that a metric describes the geometry of spacetime in general relativity, but here it's probably more of a differential geometry problem. The given metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional surface, not a full 4D spacetime. Oh right, because in GR usually you have four dimensions, but this seems to be in terms of x and y, so 2D.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic plane. Or maybe in this context, it's a specific solution to the metric given.

Wait, the metric given has a denominator (4 - x² - y²). So that would be 4 - r² where r² is x² + y². So the denominator becomes 4 - r². So the metric is ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²), which is the same as 32/(4 - r²) dr² in polar coordinates, ignoring the angular part for a second.

Wait, but in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where
