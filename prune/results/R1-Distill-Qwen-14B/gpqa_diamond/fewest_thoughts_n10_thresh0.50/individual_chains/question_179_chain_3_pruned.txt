Okay, let me try to figure out this quantum mechanics question. Hmm, so the question is about matrices and their properties, and which statement (A-D) is correct. I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators like evolution operators, observables, etc.

So the matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. Let's see what each option says.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. Wait, e^X would be the exponential of matrix X. In quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is usually unitary. For a unitary operator U, U†U = I, and applying U to a vector would preserve the norm because <ψ|U†U|ψ> = <ψ|ψ>. So if e^X is unitary, then applying it wouldn't change the norm. But when is e^X unitary? I think X needs to be skew-Hermitian because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So let's check if X is Hermitian or skew-Hermitian.

X is given as:
i  -1   2i
1   0    1
2i -1  -i

Hermitian matrices satisfy X = X†. Let me compute X† (conjugate transpose) and see. The diagonal elements: top-left is i, X† top-left is (i)* = -i, which isn't equal to i, so X isn't Hermitian. What about skew-Hermit
