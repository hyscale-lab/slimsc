Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms relates to something called the Boltzmann distribution. 

Wait, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. Oh yeah, it's n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Here, I think g is the statistical weight, which is probably the same for both stars since it's the same element and energy levels, so that part might cancel out.

The problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If in star_1's photosphere, the iron atoms are twice as excited, that means the number of atoms in the excited state is higher. So for star_1, n_excited is twice that of star_2. So let's say the ratio n1/n2 is 2, where n1 is star_1's population and n2 is star_2's.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So
