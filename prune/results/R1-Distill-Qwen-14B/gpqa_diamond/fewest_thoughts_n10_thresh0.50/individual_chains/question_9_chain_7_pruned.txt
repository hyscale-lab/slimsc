Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these molecules has C3h symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but let me think this through. So, the question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two other compounds with long names. The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. Wait, C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. Point groups are used to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements. So, C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Alternatively, it can also be thought of as having a threefold rotation followed by a reflection, which creates a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, wait, actually, for C3h, I think the h refers to the horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would have a threefold rotation and a mirror plane that is horizontal.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the elements of symmetry. C3h point group includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror (σh). Or maybe the C3h is a combination of a C3 rotation and a horizontal reflection. I think the notation can sometimes be a bit confusing. Let's clarify: the point group C3h consists of a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must have a plane of symmetry and a threefold axis that is perpendicular to that plane.

So, to determine which molecule has this symmetry, I need to look at each option
