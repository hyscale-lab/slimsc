Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, beta values, are for the different complexes. Beta1 is 9, beta2 is 40, beta3 is 63, and beta4 is 16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato complexes... So that's the Co(SCN)_2 maybe? Or maybe it's a different one. But the color might correspond to a specific complex. Since the problem mentions the blue ones, I'm guessing it's a specific complex, maybe the one with two SCN- ligands. Or perhaps four? Because sometimes the number in the name corresponds to the number of ligands. Like, dithiocyanato would be two.

Wait, the options are about the percentage of that particular complex. So, I need to find the fraction of Co species that are in the form of the dithiocyanato complex.

I remember that the stability constant (beta) gives the equilibrium for the formation of a complex. For each step, the beta is the formation constant for that particular complex. So, for Co^n+ + n SCN^- â†” Co(SCN)_n^m+, beta n is the overall formation constant for that complex.

Wait, but how does that work for multiple steps? Oh right, the overall formation constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of the beta values for each step. So, for example, the overall beta for Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be beta1 * beta2. Similarly, beta1 is for the first ligand, beta2 for adding the second, etc.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Actually, each beta represents the step-wise formation constant. For example, for the first complex, CoSCN^+ (n=1), beta1 is 9. For the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+, beta2 is 40, which is the constant for adding the second SCN- to
