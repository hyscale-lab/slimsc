Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They're asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy levels are E and a higher level, say E + ΔE, where ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me think: when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, does that mean that the population of the higher energy level (n_i) is twice as much as in star_2? Or is it that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much?

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is the population in a higher energy level compared to the lower one. Or perhaps it refers to the ratio of the excited state to the ground state being twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, perhaps the number of excited atoms in a certain level is higher in star_1. Let's say in star_1, N1 is twice that of N2 for the same energy level. Or maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, more accurately, let's think: the excitation here refers to the energy level. So the number of atoms in a specific higher energy level (say E2) relative to a lower one (E1) follows the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the ratio is (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the
