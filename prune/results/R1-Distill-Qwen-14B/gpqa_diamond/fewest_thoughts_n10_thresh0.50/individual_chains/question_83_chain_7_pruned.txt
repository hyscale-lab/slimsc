Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects its pH. Also, during a titration, the pH changes based on how much titrant has been added.

Let me break it down. First, I'll need to figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, calculate how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, so the initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, so when diluted, the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Oh right, M1V1 = M2V2.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. The pH can be found using the formula for weak acids.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, a strong base, we'll form the acetate ion. So at the 25% titration point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized, right? And at equivalence, all of it has been neutralized.

Let me outline the steps for each part.

First, calculating the equivalence point:

The moles of acetic acid initially: M = moles/volume (L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So for the equivalence point, which is the second part, the solution is the sodium acetate solution. Since all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base.

At equivalence, the solution is a buffer of sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base). So sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to form acetic
