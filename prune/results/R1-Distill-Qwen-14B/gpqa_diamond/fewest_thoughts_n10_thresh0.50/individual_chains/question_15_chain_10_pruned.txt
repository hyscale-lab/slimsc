Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit, so we can choose which to observe. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. Oh, but mass isn't the only thing—transit probability is more about the size ratio. Oh right, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us, but we can't control that. So the probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, and the orbital distance.

The formula for transit probability, as I remember, is P ≈ (R_planet / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )) or something? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the probability. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term is 0, so sqrt(1) is 1. So e doesn't matter here; we can ignore it.

So the key factors are the planet's radius (R_p), the semi-major axis (a), and the star's radius (R_star). Wait, but wait: the formula for the probability is P = (R_p + R_star) / (a * (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2)) )) ), where b is the impact parameter. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the geometric probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_star), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_star) * (something else), because the chance depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² * (1/a) * (something else?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Wait, perhaps another way: the transit probability is given by P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) )? But since e=
