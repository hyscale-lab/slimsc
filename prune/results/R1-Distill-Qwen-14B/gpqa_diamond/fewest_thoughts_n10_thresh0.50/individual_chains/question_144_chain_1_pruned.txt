Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. We're given the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I guess I need to calculate the mean decay length and pick the right one.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that's related to how far the particle travels before decaying. So, particles that live longer can travel further. But how do I calculate that?

I remember something about the relation between the particle's lifetime and its speed. The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, isn't Γ the total decay width? So, yes, the lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find out how fast the particle is moving. Because the decay distance would be the particle's speed multiplied by the lifetime, right? So, distance = v * τ.

But wait, the speed here—should I be using the speed of light? Because particles moving at relativistic speeds are much faster than non-relativistic. Since the energy is given as 8 GeV and the mass is 1.2 GeV, that's a high energy, so definitely relativistic.

So
