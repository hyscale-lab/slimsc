Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly the metric given represents.

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's written in terms of x and y. Oh, right, so maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric embedded in some space? Because I thought pseudospheres are typically considered in 3D, but perhaps this is a coordinate system for a 2D surface.

I remember that the area element in a metric is found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. So for a metric in 2D, the determinant would be g_xx * g_yy - g_xy². But wait, in this case, since dx² and dy² are multiplied by the same factor, the metric is diagonal. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))², because g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_xy = 0.

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, no, because sqrt of (32/(4 - x² - y²))² is just 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, what are the limits of integration here? The metric probably has some constraints on x and y. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². For the metric to be real, the denominator must be positive. So 4 - x² - y² > 0, which implies x² + y² < 4. So the region of integration is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere... I'm a bit shaky on that. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (which in 3D is a pseudosphere, perhaps) is 4πr², but that's for a 3D surface. Wait, no, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the definition here.

Wait, the metric given is in 2D, right
