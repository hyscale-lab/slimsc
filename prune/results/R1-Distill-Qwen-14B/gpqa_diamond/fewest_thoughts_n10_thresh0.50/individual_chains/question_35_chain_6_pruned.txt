Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. They gave some matrix structure for S and a constant c. Hmm. Let me parse the problem.

So, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, wait—that's a 2x2 matrix. And c is h over 4π. So, c = h/(4π). So, Ay = c * S.

Wait, but S as given is a 2x2 matrix. So, let me write out what Ay looks like. Let me calculate that. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, multiplying each element by c, Ay would be:

Ay = [ [ c*0 , c*(-i) ],
        [ c*i , c*0 ] ]

Which simplifies to:

Ay = [ [0, -i c],
        [i c, 0 ] ]

Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question is a multiple-choice about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the problem is not asking for the explicit values, but which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but wait, eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator should be real because observables have real eigenvalues. Is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, let's think. Matrix S: transpose S is the same as swapping the off-diagonal elements, so the transpose of S would have (0, i) in the first row and (-i, 0) in the second. But S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, S is Hermitian because S† = S. Because the complex conjugate transpose of S is the same as S.

Wait, S† would be
