Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that the question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the NMR coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product.

First, let's break down what each step does. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I've heard that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of those bridgehead positions, probably on opposite ends.

Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, especially vicinal dihalides, they can undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on bridgehead carbons separated by one carbon each. Oh, right, in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are each connected to two bridges. So 1 and 3 are on opposite sides.

Wait, but when KOH is used, maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene? Or perhaps a substitution? No, substitution would require a good leaving group and a proper structure for SN2, but adamantane is a big, rigid molecule. I think elimination is more likely here. So if we eliminate two HBr molecules, the bromines on C1 and C3 would each lose a Br- and form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or maybe the double bond forms between C1 and C3? Wait, that can't be right because they're not adjacent. Oh, wait, no, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br are on adjacent bridgeheads. Wait, no, the structure of adamantane: each bridgehead is connected to the next via a bridge. So maybe the structure is such that if the two Br are on adjacent bridgeheads, elimination would form a double bond between those two positions.

Wait, but in any case, KOH would cause elimination. So the product, which is a light yellow solid, must be an adamantane derivative with double bonds. The product's IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong
