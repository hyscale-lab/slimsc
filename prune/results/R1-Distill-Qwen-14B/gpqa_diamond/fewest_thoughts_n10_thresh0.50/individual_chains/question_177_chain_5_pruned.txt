Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right?

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 is 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 is 1.5 M2. Interesting, but I'm not sure yet how the mass comes into play here. Wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to the star's temperature and radius. Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says Luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. So maybe the mass isn't directly used here, or perhaps it's a red herring, but maybe it's part of another consideration.

The problem states that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Oh, so if both stars have the same λ_max, that implies they have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. Because Star_1 and Star_2 have the same λ_max. So if their temperatures are the same, then their luminosities will depend on their radii.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would mean the same peak wavelength, which implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

So if both stars have the same temperature, their luminosity only depends on radius. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

But wait, R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options include 2.25 as option A, but D is 2.23, which is close to 2.25, but wait, maybe I'm missing something.
