Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal. I'm not super familiar with crystallography, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. 

The given parameters are interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are equal and all angles are the same, right? So this is a primitive rhombohedral unit cell.

I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ ) )^(1/2) )? Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Another approach: I think it's d = a / √(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ). No, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula which uses the reciprocal of the lattice parameters.

Wait, rhombohedral systems are a bit tricky. The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal can be written as:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos θ,

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees for all angles.

Wait, let me get this right. For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance (d) for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - a² (hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^(-1/2) / (h² + k² + l² - hk cos α - hl cos α - kl cos α) ?

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula in terms of the Miller indices. Maybe the formula is:

d = (a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hk + hk) cos α )) ) ?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused
