Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts, each involving different reagents. The first part is the reaction of butan-2-one with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is the reaction of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile source, like NaCN, under certain conditions. I remember that the formation of a cyanohydrin involves adding a cyanide ion to a carbonyl group. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a proton or something, leading to the formation of an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

Wait, but what conditions are needed for this addition? I think that sometimes, the reaction might require an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but the carbonyl is usually not very reactive. So adding an acid could protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. That would help the cyanide attack.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CNCH2CH3. Wait, no, let me draw that. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile suggests a four-carbon chain. Hmm, wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(CN)COHCH2CH3? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide group would give (CH3)2C(OH
