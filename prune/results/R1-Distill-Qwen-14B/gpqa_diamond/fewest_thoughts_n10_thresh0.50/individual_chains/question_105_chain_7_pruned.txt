Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The situation is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. As the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question is about how this could resemble an exoplanet's effect on the light curve. They're asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Hmm. So the idea is that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots on the star, as they rotate, would cause a dimming effect. So the question is, if the star didn't have spots but had a planet instead, what planet size would cause the same change in brightness?

Wait, but wait. The question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So the scenario is, what's the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots currently do.

So first, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, I'll calculate what planet radius would cause the same amplitude.

Let me start by understanding the spot effect. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the star's surface area.

But wait, the star's surface area is 4πRstar². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 4πRstar².

Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K, since the star is 6000 K and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Wait no, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So star's Teff is 6000, spots are 5000 K.

The brightness variation occurs as the spots rotate into and out of view. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates so that
