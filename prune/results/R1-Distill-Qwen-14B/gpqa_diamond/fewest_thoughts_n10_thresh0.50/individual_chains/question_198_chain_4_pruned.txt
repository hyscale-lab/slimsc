Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit off because typically the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but here β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe I should just proceed with the given values.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, so that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second step in the formation. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I'm a bit fuzzy on the color. I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex is blue, but I'm not sure. Let me think: the different complexes have different colors based on the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a deep blue, and maybe the dithiocyanate is another color. Alternatively, maybe dithiocyanato refers to a different structure. Oh well, perhaps I should focus on the question which specifically refers to the 'blue dithiocyanato' complex. So I'll assume the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the blue is the tetrathiocyanato complex. Wait, I think in the traditional Co(II) thiocyanate complexes, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. So maybe the question refers to that. Hmm, but the question says dithiocyanato, which would imply two SCN- groups. So I'm a bit confused here. Wait, maybe I should clarify the complexes.

Wait, the problem refers to the 'blue dithiocyanato'
