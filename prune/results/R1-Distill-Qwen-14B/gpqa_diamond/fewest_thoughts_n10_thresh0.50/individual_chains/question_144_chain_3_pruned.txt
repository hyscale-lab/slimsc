Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and Γ is the decay width. But wait, how does that tie into the decay distance? Oh right, the mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity v of the meson X? I'll probably need to use the energy and mass to calculate it. Since the meson is moving relativistically, I should use the relativistic formulas.

The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So I can solve for p here.

Let me plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. Oh wait, but I should make sure the units are consistent. GeV and GeV/c² for mass, but probably the constants can help with that.

So let's compute p. The formula is p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / c.
