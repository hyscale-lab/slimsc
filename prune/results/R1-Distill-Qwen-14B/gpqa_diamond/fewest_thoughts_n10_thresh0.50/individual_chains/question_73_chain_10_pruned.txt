Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through. 

Alright, the question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D with different values for both.

First, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. You can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c to get the relative speed because that would be 0.1c, but wait, that's not how relativistic velocities work. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a common frame is: 

v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm getting the setup right. One astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c), the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c) would have a velocity relative to him. So I think u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c? Or is it the other way around? No, wait, no, let me think. When you're calculating the relative speed of the second astronaut from the frame of the first, the second astronaut's velocity would be (u' - v') / (1 - (u' v')/(c²)), but I might be mixing up the order.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The velocity addition formula is when you have an object moving at speed u in one frame, which itself is moving at speed v relative to another frame. The speed of the object in the second frame is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So in this case, we're looking for the speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first's frame.

So the first astronaut is at rest in his own frame, moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. The second astronaut is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame. So in the lab frame, the second astronaut is moving slower than the first. So from the first astronaut's perspective, what's the speed of the second?

So u (in the lab frame) for the second astronaut is 0.5c, and the lab frame is moving at 0.6c relative to the first astronaut's frame. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²) ) → (-0.1c) / (0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. But speed is positive, so the magnitude is 0.1428
