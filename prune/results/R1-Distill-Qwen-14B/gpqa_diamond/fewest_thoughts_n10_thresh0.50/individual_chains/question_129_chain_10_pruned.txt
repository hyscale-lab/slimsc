Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me start by carefully reading the question and the given information.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are four different cyclic ketones.

First, I need to figure out what compound A is based on the information given. Let's go step by step.

Looking at hint a: A reaction between compound A and a phosphorous ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So, compound A is probably a carbonyl compound (like a ketone or aldehyde), and the ylide adds a new group, forming an alkene.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw this structure mentally. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituents at positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached as a substituent.

Wait, the propan-2-ylidene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be =CH-C(CH3)2? Hmm. Let me think again. Propan-2-ylidene is the ylid part, which is like an alkylidene group. So in the product, the cyclopentane ring has a substituent that's an alkene attached. So the product has a double bond attached to the cyclopentane.

The structure of the product is cyclopentane with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4 which is a propenyl group attached as a double bond, I think. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentane where one of the substituents is a propenylidene group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituents are methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a group that's a propan-2-ylidene, which is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached via the double bond.

Wait, no. The propenylidene group would be =CHCH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, so when this group is attached to the cyclopentane ring, it's at position 4, making the structure 4-(propan-2-ylidene) cyclopentane, along with 1,2-dimethyl groups.

So the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). So the ylide must have added a CH2-C(CH3)= group to the cyclopentane.

Since the Wittig reaction forms alkenes, the starting compound A must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone) that reacts with the ylide to form an alkene.

So, if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, the starting carbonyl compound (A) would have a structure that, upon reaction with the ylide (which is PR3 with a double bond), forms this product.

In a Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (like a ketone) will be replaced by the ylide's R2C= group.

So, let's think about how the ylide would react with the carbonyl. The general reaction is:

RCOR' + ylide (PR3+=CH-) → RCH2R' + other products.

Wait, actually, the Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the R group from the ylide. So if the ylide is (CH2CH(CH3))PR3+, then the product would be an alkene where the carbonyl was.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the structure of compound A. Let's imagine that the product of the Wittig reaction (compound B in the first step) is the alkene-containing compound. So, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl.

But wait, in the first step, compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. So A is reacting with HCN, which suggests it's perhaps a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but in the first step, A → B via HCN. Let me think about that. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a cyclic ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanoh
