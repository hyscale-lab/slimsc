Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite results that don't make physical sense. You introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite and then take the limit where the cutoff goes away.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this. Let me go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell equations and all that, right? Classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences because they're not quantized. In quantum theories, you get divergences because of the loop corrections and such. So classical theories probably don't need regularization because they don't have those infinities to begin with. But wait, do they ever encounter any divergences? I think in classical electromagnetism, like when dealing with point charges, you get issues with self-energy and stuff. But those aren't handled with regularization in the same way as in quantum theories. So maybe classical E&M doesn't require regularization.

But wait, the question is about high energies. So in quantum theories, high energies could lead to different behavior. But classical theories don't deal with quantum effects. So maybe the correct answer is D.

But let me check the other options. Option A is Superstring Theory. I know string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories. Because strings are extended objects, the high-energy behavior might be better behaved. But wait, do they still require regularization? I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "cutoff" comes from the string scale, like the Planck scale. So maybe they don't need the same kind of regularization as, say, QCD or QED. But I'm not entirely sure. Do string theories inherently avoid divergences? I think they do handle things differently because of the way the theory is constructed. But does that mean they never require regularization? I'm not entirely certain.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force. At high energies, QCD
