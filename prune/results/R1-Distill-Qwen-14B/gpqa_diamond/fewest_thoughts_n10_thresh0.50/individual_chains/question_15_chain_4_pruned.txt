Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the question says two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and they have the same masses. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because it has a shorter period. I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the period squared to the cube of the semi-major axis, but maybe the exact formula isn't needed here.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so even though the mass is different, the radius is the same. I think more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's star is a bit evolved but same size as Planet_1's. 

So the probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, I think the formula is P = (R_star) / a, but considering the inclination. The probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something, maybe 1/2 because it's a geometric probability). Oh wait, I think the exact formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet radius is much smaller than the star, it's approximately (R_star / a) * (some factor). 

Wait, wait, let me think. The transit probability (the chance that the planet transits) is actually (R_star + R_planet) divided by (a * (1 - eÂ²)^0.5), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it's just (R_star + R_planet)/a. But R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximated as (R_star / a). 

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, another way: the transit probability is proportional to
