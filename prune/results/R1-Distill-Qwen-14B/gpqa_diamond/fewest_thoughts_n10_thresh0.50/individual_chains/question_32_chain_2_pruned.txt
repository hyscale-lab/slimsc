Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. It says, what is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? And X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that Lithium usually has 3 protons because it's Li-7 or something like that. But if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number would be protons plus neutrons. So Li has atomic number 3, so it's Li-6? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons make 6. Right, so the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass of the nucleus would be the mass of a Li-6 atom, but wait, no, because in a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy, but for this problem, maybe we can approximate it using the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the mass of the nucleus by considering the number of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c² or something. Wait, but I should probably look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for relativistic energy. So the energy E of a particle moving at speed v is gamma times m c squared. So gamma
