Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think through this step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D with different values, so I have to calculate it and match.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Because particles decay over time, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their speed and lifetime. So, the formula probably involves the lifetime τ multiplied by the velocity β times the speed of light c.

Right, the mean decay length L is given by L = βγ c τ. But wait, what do I know about the lifetime? I think the uncertainty principle relates the width Γ to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately the width Γ, and Δt is the lifetime τ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should probably be careful with the exact formula. Oh right, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width. So Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Okay, so now I have τ. Next, I need to find β and γ for the meson. To find β and γ, I need to know the velocity and the Lorentz factor. But how do I find that from the given E_X, m_X?

The energy E_X is the total energy of the meson? Because E_X is given as 8 GeV, which is higher than the rest mass of 1.2 GeV. So, the meson is moving relativistically. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So, solving for p: p = sqrt( (E/(c²))² - (m)^2 ) * c. Wait, let me correct that. Let me write the formula properly.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)² → (pc)² = E² - (m
