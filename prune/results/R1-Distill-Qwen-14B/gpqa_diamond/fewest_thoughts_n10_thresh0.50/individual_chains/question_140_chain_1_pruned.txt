Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm. So, the question is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's read the problem carefully. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options given are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with gas W. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, each atom in it would contribute to that. Wait, but the molecule itself? Or each atom? Hmm. The question says "same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule." Wait, maybe I should think about possible gases. Common gases include H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc.

Wait, but what about something like NH3? No, that's a gas but not in the context here. Let's think about the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Let me think of possible molecules where the sum of protons and neutrons is equal for each atom.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, if each atom is something like H (0 neutrons, 1 proton) but that wouldn't work. Wait, looking for a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of O, which has 8 protons. If it's a heavier isotope, maybe ^18O (8 protons, 10 neutrons). But that wouldn't have the same number. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons. For example, H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons are 2, total neutrons 0. That's not matching. O2 would have 16 protons (each O has 8, so 16 total) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8, assuming ^16O). So in O2, the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That would make the counts equal. So O2 would fit.

Wait, but does O2 fit the scenario? Let's see. So when X reacts with Y, it releases O2? What reactions release O2? Maybe a reaction between a metal and acid, but more likely, decomposition reactions. Or maybe a reaction involving peroxides or something else.

Wait, another possibility is CO2. CO2 has molecular formula with C and O. Let me check the protons and neutrons: Carbon has 6 protons, O has 8. So in CO2, total protons are 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C is 6 neutrons (assuming ^12C), each O is 8 (assuming ^16O, which has 8 neutrons). So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So W could be CO2.

But wait, the question says 'the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons'. So CO2 (22 each) would fit. But another possibility is H2O. Let's see: H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in ^16O). So total protons: 2 +8=10, neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So no.

Alternatively, maybe CH4? 6 protons (C) + 4*1 =
