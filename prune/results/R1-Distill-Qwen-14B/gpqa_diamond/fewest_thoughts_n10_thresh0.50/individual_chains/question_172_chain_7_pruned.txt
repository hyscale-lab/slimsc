Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, in stars, the photosphere is the outermost layer where most of the light is emitted. And it's in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So each small region is at a certain temperature, and the conditions are such that the gas behaves according to thermodynamic laws.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I'm trying to recall what determines the excitation of atoms in a star. Oh right, it's the Boltzmann distribution. The distribution of particles in energy states is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann factor says that the probability of a particle being in an energy state E is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. So the ratio of populations between two energy levels would be (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

Wait, but in this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me clarify, the energy levels are E_upper and E_lower. Suppose the higher energy level is E2 and the lower is E1. Then the ratio n_upper/n_lower would be proportional to exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

But wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star 1, the population of the higher level is twice that of the lower compared to star_2? Or wait, perhaps in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. Hmm, I need to think carefully.

Wait, the question says: iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if the energy level is a specific one, say level E, then n1_E is twice n2_E. Or wait, wait. No, the excitation is about the energy level relative to another. Oh, I think the problem states that the energy difference between the two levels is 1.38e-23 J. So
