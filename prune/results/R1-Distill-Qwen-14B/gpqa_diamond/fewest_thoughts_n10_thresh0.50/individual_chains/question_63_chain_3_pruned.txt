Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. I remember that molecules can be modeled using different quantum models depending on their behavior. So, in this case, it's a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So, for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state would be the state with the lowest possible energy, which I guess is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the molecule is absorbing a photon, which provides the energy for a transition. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The given data:
- Mass of atom X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of atom Y (My) = 2 amu
- Molecular bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency of vibration (w) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, and the options are different momenta in N*s units.

First, I think I need to figure out the energy difference between the states. Because when the photon is absorbed, its energy should match the required transition energy.

In the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, there are vibrational and rotational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational energy level (v=0) and the lowest rotational energy level (J=0). So, the next state with the lowest energy would either be increasing the vibrational state or the rotational state.

Wait, noâ€” because for a diatomic, the energy levels are quantized. The next state would be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy? Because if the photon's energy is just enough for the smallest possible jump, that would determine the momentum.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. Let me think about the order of energy levels. In a molecule, the rotational energy levels are much closer together than vibrational ones. So, a transition to a higher rotational state might require less energy than a vibrational transition.

Wait, but wait a minute
