Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically focusing on the matrix exponential function approximation using fractional methods.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with heat equations and finite differences, especially in higher dimensions, the system often leads to large matrices. Solving these systems efficiently is crucial. For sequential algorithms, you usually process each step one after another, which can be slow for big systems. Parallel algorithms, on the other hand, can split the problem into parts that run simultaneously, speeding things up.

The question mentions matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional approximation. Matrix exponentials are important because they represent the solution's time evolution in systems of linear differential equations. But how does this tie into parallel processing?

In sequential methods, you might compute the matrix exponential step by step, perhaps using something like a Taylor series or iterative methods. But for parallel methods, you need to break down the computation into parts that can be done concurrently. 

Wait, fractional approximation probably refers to methods that approximate the exponential function using fractions or rational functions. I think I've heard about Krylov subspace methods or rational approximations being used for this purpose. These methods can potentially allow parts of the computation to be parallelized because they might involve operations that can be distributed across multiple processors.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. It's important for correctness, but I'm not sure it's the key for making it parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the setup, but how does that relate to parallelism? Maybe it affects how the matrix is structured, but I'm not certain it's the key factor for parallel conversion.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Wait, complex roots would relate to the eigenvalues of the matrix. If the approximation uses complex roots, maybe that affects how the matrix is split for parallel processing. Or perhaps it's about decomposing the matrix into parts based on these roots.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to decompose rational functions into simpler terms. If the approximation is done via partial fractions, each term could be computed in parallel. That sounds plausible because each partial fraction component could be handled by a different processor, and then the results are combined.

So, thinking about it, linear partial fraction decomposition would break the problem into smaller, independent
