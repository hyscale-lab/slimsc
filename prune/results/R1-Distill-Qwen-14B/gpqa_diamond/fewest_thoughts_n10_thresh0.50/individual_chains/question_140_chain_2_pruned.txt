Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Okay, let's start by trying to figure out what each part refers to.

First, the reaction between X and Y producing gas W. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That probably means it's a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, for a molecule, the number of protons and neutrons per atom. Hmm, maybe for each atom in the molecule, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal numbers of protons and neutrons.

Wait, for example, if the molecule is H2O, the total protons are 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10, and total neutrons would be O having 8 neutrons (since O is usually O-16 with 8 neutrons) plus H having none. So 8. 10 vs 8. Not equal. So not that.

Wait, but maybe the molecule is something like O2. O2 has 16 protons each, so 32 total. Neutrons: O-16 has 8 each, so 16 total. 32 vs 16, no. Not equal.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think: another possibility is CH4. But CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4 (H) =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has none. So 6. 10 vs 6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's CO2. CO2 has 6 (C) + 16 (O) =22 protons.
