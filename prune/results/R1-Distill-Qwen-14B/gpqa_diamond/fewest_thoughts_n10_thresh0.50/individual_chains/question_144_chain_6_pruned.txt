Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data points are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and the width ΓX = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles that decay quickly have a short mean lifetime, which translates to a short decay length if they're moving quickly. But how do I calculate that?

So, I think the approach here is to find the lifetime of the meson, then calculate how far it travels before decaying. The formula I recall is something like mean decay distance L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but I have to be careful with units here. Because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ usually in units of GeV·s or something like that.

Let me jot down the relevant equations. Okay, first, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Then, the velocity v can be found from the relativistic
