Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Let me try to remember what I know.

First, the crystal structure is rhombohedral. I remember that a rhombohedral system has all sides equal, like a cube but with angles that aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be different, but in this case, they're all 30 degrees. Hmm, that must make it a special case, maybe a trigonal system?

Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. I'm not sure if that's the unit cell edge length or the distance between atoms. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter is often denoted as 'a'. So I think the interatomic distance here is 'a', so a =10 Angstrom.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal depends on the crystal system. Since it's rhombohedral, I think the formula involves the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. I recall that for a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral is more complicated because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the general formula must include the angles.

I think the general formula when the lattice isn't cubic is something like d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )) ]^(-1/2) divided by (h² + k² + l²) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Wait, I don't have that luxury right now, so I'll try to think.

Wait, another approach: The formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with reciprocal lattice vectors. The general formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) * (some terms involving cosines of angles). But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the formula is
