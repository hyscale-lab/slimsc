Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm. Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the beam. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving at velocity v. I'm a bit confused about how the movement of the medium affects the speed of light observed.

I remember that in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n. But wait, when the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed? I think this has something to do with the Doppler effect or maybe the addition of velocities in special relativity, but I'm not sure which applies here.

Wait, the glass is moving, so it's a moving medium. The light is in this medium. How does that affect things? Oh, right, when a medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed from the lab frame might be different due to the relative motion.

Let me think. If the medium is stationary, then the light's speed is c/n. But if the medium is moving, perhaps we have to consider the velocity addition formula from relativity. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; you have to
