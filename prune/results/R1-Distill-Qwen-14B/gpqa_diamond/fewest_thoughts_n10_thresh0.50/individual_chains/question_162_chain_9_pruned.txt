Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, so let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh, but wait, in the context of a pseudosphere, which is a surface in higher dimensions? Or maybe this is a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher space?

Wait, no, the pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface. So the metric here is that of a 2D surface. The question is about finding its area. So the area of a surface in 2D is computed using the metric tensor's determinant.

So the area element dA is sqrt(-det g) dx dy, right? Or wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal here (because the terms are dx² and dy², no cross terms), g_xy is zero. So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy.

Looking at the metric, the coefficients are both [32/(4 - x² - y²)] for dx² and dy². So g_xx and g_yy are both equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(
