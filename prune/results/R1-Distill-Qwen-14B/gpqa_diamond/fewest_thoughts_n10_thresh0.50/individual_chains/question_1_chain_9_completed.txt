Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must satisfy ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) / 2 or something? Or perhaps the sum because each has their own uncertainty.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty principle for each state. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

So to resolve two energy levels, the difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Or perhaps each must be resolved from each other, so the difference should be greater than each of their uncertainties. Wait, but that depends on the context.

Wait, let me think. Suppose you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2. The energy uncertainty for each is ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1), because sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ) for the energy uncertainty when τ is the lifetime. Or wait, sometimes it's ħ/τ. I need to clarify that.

The uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So if Δt is the lifetime τ, then ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/(2τ).

So E1 has ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and E2 has ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

Wait, but if E1 and E2 are two separate energy levels, then what matters is the energy resolution between them. So for the two levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference Δ must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because each level's uncertainty could lead to their energies overlapping if Δ is too small.

So Δ = |E2 - E1| must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2? Or perhaps greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2?

Wait, maybe another approach. The lifetime given is the mean lifetime. The uncertainty in energy would be on the order of ħ divided by the mean lifetime. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/τ1. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the minimum energy difference needed for them to be distinguishable. Let me think: The energy resolution required is such that the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is too small, the measurement might not be able to tell them apart.

So, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties of each state. Because if ΔE is greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the two levels are well separated.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think about it. Suppose each state has an energy range around their mean energies. If the separation ΔE is greater than the sum of the ranges, then they don't overlap and are distinguishable.

So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). Wait, is it 1/(2τ) or 1/τ? I think the energy-time uncertainty is often written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So for each state, Δt is the lifetime τ, so ΔE is ħ/(2τ).

So,

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9) = ħ/(2e-9)
ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = ħ/(2e-8)

Now, to sum these up: ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2e-9) + ħ/(2e-8) = ħ/(2e-9) [1 + 10 ] = (11 ħ) / (2e-9) ) = (11/2) * ħ * 1e9.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the numerical value.

Let me compute each in electron volts.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. And 1 eV is 1.60217663e-19 joules.

So, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 in eV.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) )

= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ) J
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-25 J
= 0.5272859e-25 J

Convert to eV: 0.5272859e-25 J * (1 eV / 1.60217663e-19 J)
= 0.5272859e-25 / 1.60217663e-19 ≈ (5.272859e-26) / 1.602e-19 ≈ approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-8 ) J
= 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 0.527285e-26 J

Convert to eV: 0.527285e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the exponents:

Wait, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

So ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-8) ) J.

1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26.

So, 1.05457e-34 / (2e-8) ) = (1.05457)/(2) * 1e-26 ≈ 0.527e-26 J.

Then, 0.527e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 0.527e-26 / 1.602e-19.

That's (5.27e-27) / (1.602e-19) ) = about 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum of the two ΔE's is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = about 3.62e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than about 3.62e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → much larger than 3.6e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → 1e-8 is 10^-8, which is 1e-8 eV.

Wait, but 1e-8 is about 3 times smaller than 3.6e-7. Because 3.6e-7 is 3.6 * 1e-7, which is 360e-8. So 1e-8 is 10 times smaller than that. Therefore, the minimum ΔE should be larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger, so that would work.

Wait, but wait: Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So yes, it would be resolvable.

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1e-9

B)1e-11

C)1e-4

D)1e-8

Wait, so our calculated minimal needed is around 3.6e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would be resolvable.

Looking at the options:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is larger than 3.6e-7, so that's okay.

D is 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is about 3e-8, which is 0.03 times 1e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.03 times the minimal needed. So that's too small.

Wait, but wait, the question says which one "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7. So that would work.

Other options: option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7, so that's insufficient.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait—another thought: Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the uncertainties. Because in the energy-time uncertainty principle, the uncertainty for each state is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So when considering two states, the total uncertainty in the system is not just the sum of the individual uncertainties. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that each state's energy uncertainty is ΔE1 and ΔE2. The separation between the two states must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to avoid overlap. So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, in this case, ΔE must be greater than 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the options are:

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 277 times larger, so that's way more than the required 3.6e-7. So yes, that's sufficient.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / (2\tau) \), where \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

### Step 1: Compute the energy uncertainties
For the first state:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60217663 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be greater than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) to distinguish the two energy levels. Among the options, only \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) satisfies this condition.
