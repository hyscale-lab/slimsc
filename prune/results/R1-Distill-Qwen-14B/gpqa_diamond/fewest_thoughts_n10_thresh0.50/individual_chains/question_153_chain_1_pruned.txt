Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question involves three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. I need to find out what the major products are and match them with the given options. Hmm, the options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A, B, and C.

First, let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a malonate ester. It can form an enolate, right? Under basic conditions like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), which is a strong base, the malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, the (E) configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. But for the reaction, the geometry might not matter as much as the presence of the electron-deficient double bond.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a diethyl malonate analog) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond, and then after proton transfer, we'd get a new compound. Since the malonate is a diester, the product would be a triester, probably.

Let me visualize this: The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is CH2-C(-OEt)2-^- attacking the beta carbon (the CH2 part). Wait, no. The enolate is from the malonate: the structure is CH2-C(COOEt)2^- which attacks the acrylate at the beta position, which is the CH2 end.

So, the attack would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the product would have the two carbonyl groups from the malonate attached to the new carbon chain.

Wait, the product would be a conjugate addition. So the structure after the addition would be something like (CH2-C(COOEt)2)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), the addition would be between the malonate's enolate and the CH2 of the acrylate.

So the product would be CH2(C(COOEt)2)-
