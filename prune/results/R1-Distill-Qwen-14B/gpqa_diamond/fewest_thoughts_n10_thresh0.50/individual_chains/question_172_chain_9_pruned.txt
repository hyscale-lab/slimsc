Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. 

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

In this case, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, the population ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. Wait no, wait. Oh wait, no. Because the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think that means the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps the population in star_1's excited state is twice that of star_2's excited state. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the excitation level is higher. So the ratio of upper to lower levels (n_upper/n_lower) would be higher in star_1. According to the Boltzmann equation, that ratio depends exponentially on temperature. 

So for star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). Or wait, maybe star_1 has a ratio that is twice star_2's. Wait, the problem says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But wait, that might be a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is measured as the population ratio. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2. 

Wait, suppose for star_1, the ratio is r1 = (n_upper)/(n_lower) and for star_2, it's r2. Then, the problem states that r1 = 2 * r2. 

Using the Boltzmann equation: 

r = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)) 

Assuming the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (since it's the same transition in iron), then the ratio r is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

So for star_1: r1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) 

For star_2: r2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) 

And r1 = 2 * r2. 

So substituting:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) 

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for T1 and T2. 

ln(exp(-
