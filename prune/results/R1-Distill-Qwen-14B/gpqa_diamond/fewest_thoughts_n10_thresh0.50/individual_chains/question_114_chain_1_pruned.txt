Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me see... I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition?

Wait, wait. Oh right! When a ketone is treated with a cyanide like NaCN, it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone has a carbonyl group, which is electrophilic. So the CN^- would attack the carbonyl carbon. That would form a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, cyanohydrin formation. The product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

So for that reaction, what conditions are needed? I think the cyanohydrin formation typically happens under acidic conditions. So the reagent A might be something like an acid, maybe H3O+ or another proton source like H2SO4. Because adding acid would help in generating the necessary carbocation or activating the carbonyl.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and acid (H3O+ perhaps) gives the cyanohydrin. So A is probably H3O+.

Then the second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with reagent B (which is H2O) to get the corresponding butanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. Oh, I think I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions and heat.

Wait, but the reagent here is B, which is H2O. But maybe B is the acid or base used in the hydrolysis. For example, if I have a nitrile and I want it to become a carboxylic acid, I might use H3O+ as a catalyst. Or perhaps another strong acid like
