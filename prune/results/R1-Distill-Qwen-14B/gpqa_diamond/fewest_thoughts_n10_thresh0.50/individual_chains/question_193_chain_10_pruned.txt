Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or 'plx', but I think in this case, they've used plx as the variable.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But wait, how does parallax relate to distance? Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Parallax (in parsecs) equals 1 over distance (in parsecs), right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, I think the formula is d = 1/plx. So when parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So, if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then substituting d in terms of plx, perhaps I can express N in terms of d.

Wait, let's write that down. Let me think. Let's say N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which simplifies to N ∝ d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So we're looking at how N changes as a function of r, the distance.
