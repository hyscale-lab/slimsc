Okay, so I've got this question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question asks which theory never needs regularization. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite results that don't make physical sense. So the theory that doesn't have these divergences wouldn't need regularization, right?

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory: I remember that string theory is supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything, including quantum gravity. I think string theories have different approaches but perhaps they don't have the same kind of divergences as other QFTs. Or wait, do they still need regularization? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe because it's a theory that incorporates higher dimensions or something, it handles things differently. Or perhaps superstring theory avoids some divergences because of supersymmetry?

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong force. I remember that it's a non-Abelian gauge theory. At high energies, it behaves perturbatively because of asymptotic freedom. But wait, does it require regularization? I think that QCD does have issues with things like confinement, but when you calculate loop diagrams, you might run into divergences. So you'd need a way to regularize them, like using lattice methods or dimensional regularization. So maybe QCD does require regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I think QED does have divergences in calculations, especially in loop diagrams. For example, the calculation of the electron self-energy leads to infinities. So renormalization is needed, which implies regularization was a step before that. So QED does require regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: Wait, classical theories don't involve quantization. So they don't have the same kind of divergences as quantum theories. In classical ED, when you have point charges, you might have issues with the fields at the exact location of the charge—like the electric field going to infinity there. But does that require regularization? I don't think so. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique, so classical theories don't need it. So this option might be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of these don't use regularization at all.

Superstring theory: I'm more confused about this. I think that since string theories are background-dependent and use different methods, but I'm not certain if they avoid regularization. I might be wrong, but I think that because they are different from QFT, they might not require the same kind of regularization. Or maybe they do, but in a different framework.

Wait, another thought: regularization is a method used in perturbative calculations. If a theory doesn't require perturbative methods because it's either exactly solvable or because its perturbative approach doesn't lead to divergences, then maybe it doesn't need regularization. Hmm.

But QED and QCD are both quantum theories, so they need regularization. Classical ED isn't a quantum theory, so it doesn't require regularization techniques like those used in quantum theories.

So looking back at the options, the only theory that doesn't
