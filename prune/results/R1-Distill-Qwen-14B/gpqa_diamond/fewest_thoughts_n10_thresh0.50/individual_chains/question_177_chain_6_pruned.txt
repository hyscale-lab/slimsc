Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're supposed to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I remember is that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² multiplied by T^4.

Wait, and since both stars are black bodies, their luminosities should follow this formula. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean their peak emission wavelengths are the same? Because Wien's law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so if λ_max is the same, then T is the same for both stars. So T1 = T2.

Wait but then why are their velocities different? Because Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But does radial velocity affect the temperature or the luminosity? Hmm. Well, the Doppler effect might shift the observed wavelength, but the intrinsic emission (peak wavelength) would still be the same.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The peak wavelength (λ_max) that each star emits is determined by their temperature. But if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted due to
