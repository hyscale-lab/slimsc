Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N = 1 / plx^5. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options given are A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right! The formula for parallax is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So if I have plx, I can find d as 1/plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars varying with plx^(-5). So N is proportional to plx^-5. Let me write that down: N ∝ plx^(-5).

Since I need to relate this to distance, I should express plx in terms of d. So plx = 1/d, right? So plx is inversely proportional to d. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

So let's substitute plx in terms of d. If N ∝ plx^-5, substituting gives N ∝ (1/d)^-5. Because if plx = 1/d, then (1/d)^-5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. That would mean the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance, r. I think that's asking about how the number changes as you move from one distance to another, like the rate of change. Oh, right, so we're looking for the derivative of N with respect to d, to find out how N changes per unit distance.

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd is the derivative. Taking the derivative of d^5 gives 5 d^4. So the rate of change of N with respect to d is proportional to d^4.

But wait, the answer options are in terms of r. Oh, perhaps r is the variable for distance, so d is the same as r. So then the rate of change would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.
