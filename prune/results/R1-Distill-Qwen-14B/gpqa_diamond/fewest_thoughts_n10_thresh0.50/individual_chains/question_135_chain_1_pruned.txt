Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, wait. I think I need to make sense of the Lagrangian. So the term is -λ times some fermion field terms and X(y). It looks like X is a scalar field because it's written without any derivatives or anything, just X(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order, and there are four options.

Hmm, okay. So I'm supposed to find which fermions X can decay into. I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. So the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any pair of fermions produced must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Fermions come in pairs, so for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X. Right, because in the rest frame of X, each would get half the mass energy, but maybe I'm thinking of it wrong. Let me think again.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when X decays into two particles, say a fermion and its antiparticle, the combined rest mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion would have a rest mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each? Because if each is m, then 2m <= 6 GeV → m <= 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not quite right. Because in the decay, the fermions can have kinetic energy as well. So the condition is that the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So for each fermion pair, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all fermions with masses less than or equal to 3 GeV
