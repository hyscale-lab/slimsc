Okay, so I've been given this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. So, a theory that respects Lorentz symmetry is one that looks the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion as long as they are not accelerating (inertial frames).

Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations in space and time. So, it's like the full symmetry of special relativity, including moving from one point to another (translations) and changes in reference frames (Lorentz transformations). If a theory has Poincare symmetry, it must also have Lorentz symmetry because Poincare includes Lorentz. Wait, so does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Or is it more about Lorentz?

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory based on the Standard Model. The Standard Model itself respects Poincare symmetry because it incorporates special relativity. So, operators in SMEFT should also respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators." So, if Poincare is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz, then all operators must respect Poincare, which in turn means they must respect Lorentz. So do I have to choose whether the question is about Poincare or Lorentz?

Wait, the options have both 1 and 2 as separate choices. Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2 (so Lorentz and Poincare), option C is 1,2,4 (so Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT). I need to figure out which of these are required.

Wait, but I think that in effective field theories, the symmetries are the same as the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should also. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they must respect Lorentz symmetry as well. So the operators need to respect both.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the SMEFT
