Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star has a larger parallax, it’s closer to us.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let me think. If stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their spatial density is uniform? I think that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space. But how does that translate into the parallax distribution?

Parallax (p) is in arcseconds, and the formula connecting parallax and distance is p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as p increases, distance d decreases. But the number of stars within a certain range of distance would depend on how the volume changes with distance.

Right, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars N in that shell is n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, let's think about the parallax. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So if I consider a small change in parallax dp, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let me do a substitution. dr = derivative of d w.r. to p times dp. d = 1/p, so dr/dp = -1/p². Hmm, but since we're considering small ranges, the negative might not matter here. So dr ≈ - (1/p²) dp. But since dp is positive for increasing p, the shell's thickness in distance terms would be |dr| = (1/p²) dp.

Wait, but when you do a change of variables in integration, you have to adjust for the Jacobian. So perhaps I should express the number of stars as a function of p.

The number of stars between p and p + dp would be N = n * Volume. The Volume in terms of p would be the volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr, which we've related to dp.

So Volume as a function of p is 4πd² dr. But since d=1/p, substit
