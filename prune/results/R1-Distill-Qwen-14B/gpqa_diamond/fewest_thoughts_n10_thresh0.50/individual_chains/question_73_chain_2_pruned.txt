Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, the simple subtraction of speeds (like 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c) doesn't work because of the relativistic effects. So, I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, right, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait, no, that's when you're finding the velocity of one frame as observed from another. Oh, right, in this case, each astronaut is moving in the same direction, so the relative speed is the difference between their velocities, but calculated using the relativistic formula.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The relative speed between the two astronauts is the speed of the faster one minus the slower one, but adjusted for relativity. So, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the first, and v is the velocity of the second.

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. Both are moving
