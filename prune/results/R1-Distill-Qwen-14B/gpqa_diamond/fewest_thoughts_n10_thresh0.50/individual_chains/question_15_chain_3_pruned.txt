Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's, which is slightly evolved. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they want the best chance of detecting it with limited time.

Wait, so transiting probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher if the orbital plane is edge-on. But how do I calculate that?

Oh right, the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. The formula for the probability (P) is roughly (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))), where a is the semi-major axis, R_star is the star's radius. But since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies to R_star / a. But wait, there's another factor. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / sin i), but since the inclination i is random, the average probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (m_planet/(m_star))² )) ) or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps that's the minimum mass from RV. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass, but in this case, both planets have the same mass, so m_planet is the same for both.

The transit probability is the geometric probability, which is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for us to see the transit. The formula for the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is usually much
