Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I remember that stability constants tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. A higher β means a more stable complex.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So I think this refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second species in the series. So β2 is 40, right?

I think the general approach here is to consider the different possible complexes that cobalt can form with thiocyanate and calculate their concentrations based on the stability constants.

The complexes are likely in the order Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. Each step forms a complex with an additional SCN-.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants. I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula involving the logarithm of the concentrations and the stability constants
