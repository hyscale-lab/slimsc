Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through each step carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, I think I need to determine what reagents A and B are from the options given. The options are combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Let me break this down into the two reactions.

First Reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions does this happen?

Typically, the addition of a nucleophile like CN- to a ketone requires some kind of acid catalysis. So, maybe reagent A is an acid. The product here is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. Let me think about the mechanism.

In the presence of an acid, the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, water (or another proton source) helps in the elimination step to form the alcohol and release the cyanide ion. Wait, but in this case, the product is an alcohol and a nitrile attached to the same carbon. Oh, wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw its structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would probably give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, I think. So, the reaction is the addition of cyanide to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

I think the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, when dealing with nitriles, HCN is involved, but here it's NaCN. Alternatively, maybe sulfonic acid is used as a catalyst because it's a strong acid and can protonate the carbonyl without being consumed. But in the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a nitrile and an alcohol. So, maybe the mechanism is the formation of an imine or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction? No, wait, NaCN is a source of CN-.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction. But hydrocyanation typically involves adding HCN to alkenes, not ketones. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, I remember that in the presence of an
