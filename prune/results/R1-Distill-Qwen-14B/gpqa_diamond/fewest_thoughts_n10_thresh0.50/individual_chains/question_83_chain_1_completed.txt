Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through what I remember.

Alright, so the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe after calculating, I can match my answers.

First, let me outline what I know. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, and NaOH is a strong base. The reaction between them should be a neutralization, producing acetate ions and water.

Let me break it down into parts. First, I'll calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Then, figure out the equivalence point and pH there. After that, the 25% titration point.

Wait, wait. Let's do the dilution first. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. When we dilute it, the concentration becomes moles / new volume. So 0.001 / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. Wait, 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025. Oh, right, because 0.04 is 40 mL. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check that. 20 mL of 0.05 M. So 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol (since 0.05 M is 0.05 mmol per mL). So 1 mmol in 40 mL gives 0.025 M, yeah that's correct.

Next, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid in solution: 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence would be (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L, so 10 mL.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Moles of acetic acid is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So at equivalence, 10 mL of NaOH is added.

So the equivalence point volume is 10 mL. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when you dilute the acetic acid, the concentration is lower, but the moles remain the same. So the equivalence point calculation is correct.

Now, the pH at equivalence point. Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, the equivalence point will be in the basic region. The salt formed is sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. So the solution will be basic. To find pH, I can calculate the concentration of acetate ions and use the Kb.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The total volume is original solution (40 mL) plus added NaOH (10 mL) → 50 mL or 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb of acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction for acetate: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb is about 5.405e-10.

Set up the expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced. So:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So approximate equation: x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is about 3.29e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) → log(3.29) is about 0.517, so pOH ≈ 5.483. pH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517, which rounds to 8.52.

Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute [OH^-] exactly.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6. pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.5168.

So pOH ≈ 5.4832 → pH ≈ 8.5168, so about 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

Wait, but I remember that for weak bases, sometimes you might need to use the exact quadratic solution, but given Kb is so small, the approximation is valid.

Now, moving on to the 25% titration point. 25% of the equivalence volume has been reached. The equivalence volume is 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL.

Wait, no. Wait, the equivalence volume is 10 mL. So 25% of that is 2.5 mL. So when 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let me compute the moles reacted.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. After reacting 0.00025 mol, the remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now has both acetic acid and acetate ions. This is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (moles of acetate) / (moles of acetic acid) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, approximately 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the volumes. Because when you add NaOH, the total solution volume changes. So the concentrations aren't just based on moles, but the volume.

Wait, I have to remember that the initial solution is 40 mL, and the added NaOH is 2.5 mL, so the total volume is 42.5 mL.

But wait, since the moles are in the ratio, the actual concentrations would be (moles)/(volume in L), but when taking the ratio, the volume cancels out.

So for the Henderson-Hasselbalch, [A-] is moles of acetate divided by total volume, [HA] is moles of acetic acid divided by same volume. So their ratio is moles A- / moles HA, which is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So the calculation is correct.

So at 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options: Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, let me recap. At 25% titration, pH is about 4.26. At equivalence, 8.52. So the option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH required to neutralize the acetic acid are equal to the moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol). The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is the sum of the diluted acetic acid (40 mL) and the added NaOH (10 mL), giving a total volume of 50 mL (0.05 L). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing a basic solution. The equilibrium constant for this hydrolysis is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\), the hydroxide ion concentration \([OH^-]\) is calculated as:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[CH_3COO^-] - x}, \quad x^2 \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{mL} + 2.5 \, \text{mL} = 42.5 \, \text{mL} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733, \quad \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.0176}\right) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
