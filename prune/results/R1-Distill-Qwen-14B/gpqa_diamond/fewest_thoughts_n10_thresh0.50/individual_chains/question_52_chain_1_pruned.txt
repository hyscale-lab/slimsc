Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.

Then there's this part about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. They also mention that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. I think I need to use the concept of the Boltzmann equation or maybe something related to the Saha equation since it's about ionization and energy levels in stars.

Wait, no, because the question is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels of neutral Ti. So it's probably the Boltzmann equation. The Saha equation deals with ionization, but this is about two states within the same ion, so Boltzmann applies.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

So the ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) )

In this case, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, I need to think about how the spots affect the observed temperature. Oh wait, the question gives the overall Teff when spots are present as 5500 K. So, I guess the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is dropping because some parts (the spots) are cooler.

But for the photosphere, when you have spots, part of the surface is cooler. The overall Teff is given as 5500 K. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the whole star is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, no, the star's Teff when 40% of its surface is covered by spots is 5500 K. Wait, but actually, the star's overall luminosity would change. Hmm, maybe I should think about the average temperature.

Wait, no. Effective temperature is a measure that accounts for the total luminosity and radius. So Teff is L/(4πR²σ)^1/4. So if spots cover 40% of the surface, but those spots are cooler, the overall Teff would decrease.

But when the question talks about the photospheric effective temperature, I think it's referring to the temperature of the photosphere when spots are present. Or maybe the Teff is
