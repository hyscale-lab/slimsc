Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about stars with spots and how their effective temperature affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, so the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not spotted, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The part that's confusing me is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They said that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is unspotted versus spotted. 

Wait, so the ratio of level 1 to level 2 is R = N1/N2. They observed that when the star has spots, R decreases. So when the star is unspotted, the ratio is higher. 

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

The transition between these levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think that's a specific line, maybe the Ti I line. But what matters here is the energy difference between the two levels. 

Wait, the wavelength is given. Oh, right! The energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. But for the purposes of the ratio, maybe we can find the ratio of the Boltzmann factors when T changes.

So, the key here is that when the star's temperature decreases, how does the ratio R change? Let's think: the ratio R is n1/n2. Let me write that as R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. Because E2 > E1 (since the photon emitted is from higher to lower energy
