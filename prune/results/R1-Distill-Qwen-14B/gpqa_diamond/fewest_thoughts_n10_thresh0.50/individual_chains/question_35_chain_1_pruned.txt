Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but let's see.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that S might be related to the Pauli matrices or something similar. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms.

Pauli matrices:
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Oh, wait a second, the given S matrix is exactly σy. So S is σy. So Ay is c multiplied by σy. And c is h/(4π). So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

First, let's write out Ay. Since σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], multiplying by c gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[
