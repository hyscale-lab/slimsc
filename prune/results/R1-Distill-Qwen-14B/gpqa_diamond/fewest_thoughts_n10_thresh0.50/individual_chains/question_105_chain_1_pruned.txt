Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. Half of it (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When one hemisphere has these spots, the star's brightness varies as it rotates, which can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking, what radius would an exoplanet need to have to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star. So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would give the same light curve amplitude?

Hmm. Okay, I think the key here is to compute the change in brightness caused by the spots and compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.

First, let me think about the spotted star. The star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. So effectively, the spots cover 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2), since a hemisphere is half the surface area. Wait, no. Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. So the spots are darker and emit less light.

The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. Since the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, the spots come into view as the star rotates. So when the spots are facing us, the star's brightness decreases.

The change in brightness (ΔF) can be thought of as the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area between the spots and the rest of the star.

Flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the constant.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is the area of spots multiplied by (F_spot - F_star).

Wait, but when the spots are on the near side, they contribute less flux than the surrounding areas. So the total flux from the star when the spots are visible will be (F_total) = F_star * (1 - (A_spots * (F_spot / F_star))).

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the fractional change in brightness (ΔF/F) is the area of the spots (as a fraction of the star's surface) multiplied by the change in flux per unit area between the spot and the rest of the star.

So the fractional change (ΔF/F) would be (A_spot_fraction) * (F_spot - F_star) / F_star.

Wait, but when the spots are in front, they block the light from the underlying star. So the flux coming from that area is lower. So the total flux from the star will decrease by the area of the spots times the difference in flux per unit area.

So the fractional change is (A_spots) * (F_spot - F_rest)
