Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure with four cyclohexane rings, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think it's an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—those are not adjacent carbons. Because in adamantane, the structure is such that positions 1 and 3 are across from each other, not next to each other. Oh wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a way that each has three bonds within the structure. Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about elimination but forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but that's a bit far apart. Hmm, maybe the reaction is a double elimination leading to a diene? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility. KOH can cause a substitution reaction. But since it's heated, elimination is more likely. So maybe each Br leaves, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted, leading to formation of a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so two Brs are on adjacent carbons? Or are they on opposite ends? Wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So maybe each Br is on a different bridgehead. So, perhaps when they eliminate, each Br leaves, each taking a hydrogen from adjacent carbons. So maybe each elimination happens on each bridgehead, leading to double bonds.

Wait, but let me think. When you have two bromines on the same carbon, KOH would cause elimination, but here the bromines are on different carbons. So each Br would eliminate, but perhaps in such a way that the structure becomes more open. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, but wait, 1 and 3 in adamantane—the structure is such that they're on opposite faces. Hmm, perhaps the molecule can eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to a diene or some sort of conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a new structure with double bonds. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which suggests maybe a conjugated diene or maybe an epoxide? No, but the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe the product is a ketone or an ester or something with a carbonyl.

Wait, when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, under elimination, they could form epoxides via a ring-opening, but that's usually for vicinal dihalides. Hmm, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane may not form an epoxide because the bromines aren't adjacent.

Wait, another thought: when two bromides are present in a structure, KOH can lead to an elimination to form a double bond, but maybe in this case, each Br is eliminated, leading to the formation of two double bonds. Or perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to a conjugated system.

Wait, the product is a solid with an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That suggests that the product might have a ketone group. So, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution with OH groups, but then dehydration would form a ketone.

Wait, but KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane can undergo two nucleophilic substitutions, each Br would be replaced by OH. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diol-adamantane. But then, if that's the case, would elimination happen? Or perhaps, if the diol is formed, it could undergo elimination upon heating.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps, the diol (if formed) is dehydrated to form a ketone. But wait, in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are bridgehead positions. So, if each bridgehead has an OH, would the dehydration form a carbonyl group?

Wait, bridgehead carbonyl groups are possible but not very common because of Bredt's rule. Bredt's rule says that double bonds (and hence, ketones) don't form easily at bridgeheads unless the structure is very stable. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe the product isn't a diol. Let's think again. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's an E2 elimination for each Br, leading to the formation of two adjacent double bonds, creating a conjugated diene. But then, that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a double bond, but maybe the structure allows for some ring opening.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of an enol, which upon dehydration forms a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, abstracting Hs and eliminating Br–, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another angle: the NMR spectrum of product 1. The 1H NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Hmm, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's probably two equivalent Hs, perhaps attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester? Or maybe a ketone.

Wait, another thought. The initial product is a diol, perhaps, but then it undergoes further reaction. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to some kind of epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—epoxide formation would require adjacent Brs, which they aren't. So that might not be it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but how does that lead to a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then the two O- groups are linked, forming an oxide ring. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But then, how does that form from di-bromide and KOH? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, the product after KOH treatment probably has a carbonyl group. So perhaps, each Br is eliminated, and the structure forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, and then the diol loses two water molecules to form two carbonyl groups. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diol after substitution, then upon heating, dehydration occurs to form a ketone at each position. But wait, bridgehead ketones are not common because of Bredt's rule. So maybe that's not the case.

Another possibility: the KOH may cause an elimination reaction, leading to the formation of a ketone through oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving as Br–, and Hs being abstracted to form a double bond. But how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O–, leading to a structure where the O– groups are connected, forming an oxide. Wait, perhaps the product is an oxirane (epoxide), but as discussed earlier, 1,3-dibromoadamantane can't form an epoxide because the bromines are not adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't make sense in this structure.

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms two carbonyl groups. So, each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene, and then further oxidation. But that’s an extra step not mentioned. The question says KOH is the only reagent in the first step.

Hmm, I might need to think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are bridgehead positions. So, the molecule has two bromine atoms at opposite bridgeheads.

When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated with adjacent Hs, leading to the formation of two double bonds. But it's not clear how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the diol could lose water under heat to form a carbonyl. But again, bridgehead carbonyls are not common. Unless it's part of a larger structure.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone elsewhere. Let me think about the structure.

Suppose the 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, loses two HBr molecules and forms a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that's not likely because the dihalide isn't vicinal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH induces a ring-opening, leading to a structure with a carbonyl group. For example, if a six-membered ring opens up, forming a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a quinone structure, which has conjugated carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H, likely a singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, which could be multiple sets of multiplets), and 1.94 (2H). Let me think about the possible groups.

The 4.79 ppm singlet for 2H suggests possibly a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O. So maybe an ether (like OCH2O) or an ester, but since IR shows a carbonyl, perhaps an ester.

Wait, if product 1 is an ester, then the structure would have an ester group. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but again, not sure.

Another approach: if the product after KOH is a carbonyl-containing compound, perhaps it's a ketone. The NMR would then have a singlet for the ketone's adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. The 1720 cm^-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. That's more in line with an ester or a ketone. So product 1 likely has a carbonyl group.

Suppose product 1 is a diketone. But earlier, I thought bridgehead ketones are not common. Alternatively, the carbonyl is in a non-bridgehead position.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. How? For example, perhaps each Br is eliminated with adjacent Hs, leading to a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, leading to a double bond. But then, where is the carbonyl coming from? Unless the structure is such that the double bonds can form conjugated dienes, which might show up in the NMR as certain signals.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is formed via some rearrangement after elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. KOH could substitute each Br with an OH, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless the diol undergoes dehydration to form a ketone.

But as I mentioned earlier, bridgehead ketones might not be stable. Unless the structure is such that the carbonyl is in a non-bridgehead position.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. Let me think about the structure. If the adamantane loses parts upon elimination, maybe it forms a smaller ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mixture of compounds, but I think the first step is giving a single product.

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but again, the initial dihalide isn't vicinal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base and leading to the formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound has two Brs, and each elimination forms a double bond, and the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl group through conjugation.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me move to the second step to see if that helps.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but what's product 1? If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an acylated product. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is a more substituted ester.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyne. No, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, heating with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to the formation of an enol ether or some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the aluminum isopropoxide is causing ring-opening. Hmm, but earlier I thought product 1 isn't an epoxide.

Another angle: Since the second step uses aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But for that, product 1 would need to be an aromatic ring, which adamantane isn't. Hmm.

Wait, unless product 1 is a carbonyl compound with an adjacent leaving group. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienophile, and the aluminum isopropoxide facilitates some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diene, and when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction. But I'm not sure of the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is used in a Wittig reaction. Oh, wait, the Wittig reaction uses a phosphorus ylide to form alkenes. But product 2 is formed after that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again about product 1. The NMR shows a singlet at δ4.79 (2H), which is probably a CH2 group attached to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen. Let's say it's OCH2O, but that would be an ether bridge. 

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, where each OH is on a bridgehead. But then, the NMR would show broad signals for OH, but the problem says to exclude exchanging protons. So maybe the OHs aren't in the NMR spectrum. Alternatively, the diol could lose two H2O molecules to form a ketone, but then that goes back to the bridgehead issue.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial reaction forms a geminal diol. Wait, but gem-diols are usually not stable except in certain cases. But product 1 is a solid, so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O–, leading to an oxide structure. So, product 1 is a diepoxide? But then, the IR might show an epoxide peak around 1250 cm^-1, which isn't mentioned here. The IR shows 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think about the overall process. The first step is elimination to form product 1, which has a carbonyl. Then, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3.

Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 is an alkene. Let me think about how product 1 would lead to product 2. If product 1 is a carbonyl compound, perhaps product 2 is an addition across the carbonyl, forming an alkene. For example, using a strong Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation, forming an enone.

Wait, product 1 could be a ketone. When heated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes a dehydration to form an enol, which then can form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, which upon treatment could form a conjugated diene.

Wait, but how would product 1 (a ketone) become product 2 (an alkene) using Al isopropoxide? Maybe it's a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether formed via elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but for that, product 1 would need to have an aromatic ring, which I don't think it does.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a ketone or aldehyde proton. But the question mentions that we're to exclude Hs that exchange with D2O, so maybe not aldehyde protons.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Let's think about coupling in the NMR. Each neighboring H can cause splitting. If a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, it would split into a triplet if there are two adjacent Hs. But wait, if the H is next to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2, then the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, in ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved into carbonyls. So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have two carbonyls where the double bonds were.

But perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is a simple alkene, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyl groups, possibly as a diketone or dialdehyde.

Wait, but considering the NMR of product 3, which is after ozonolysis and workup with DMS (which is a reductive workup, I think). Wait, no, DMS is a mild reductive workup. Ozonolysis followed by DMS usually breaks the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones without further reduction. So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

Now, the most deshielded H in product 3 would be near the carbonyl. Let's say it's a ketone. The H adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded, as they're near the electronegative oxygen.

In the NMR, the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring Hs. Suppose the H is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, each H in the CH2 would cause splitting. So that H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is adjacent to more than one set of Hs, the splitting could be more complex. For example, if the H is next to a CH2 that's next to another CH2, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with the H in question, leading to a triplet, but each of those Hs could also be coupled with Hs from the next CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the H is adjacent to a CH2 group which is itself adjacent to another CH2. Then, the H would have two neighboring Hs (from the first CH2) and each of those Hs would have two more neighboring Hs (from the next CH2). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH2 group, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, making it a -CH2-CH2- structure. So, the H in question would have two neighboring Hs (from the first CH2), each of which has two neighbors (from the second CH2). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Or a triplet from the first coupling and then each of those split into triplets again, leading to a more complex pattern.

But wait, the options don't include a triplet of triplets as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), or pentet (D).

So, if the H is adjacent to two Hs, each of which is adjacent to two more Hs, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets (option B) or a doublet of triplets (option C). Alternatively, if the H is coupled to two Hs on one side and one H on the other, maybe a different pattern.

Wait, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, the H is next to two Hs, and each of those Hs is next to two Hs. So the splitting would be first a triplet (from two Hs), and each of those would split into triplets again, making a triplet of triplets. So option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is next to a CH2 group which is next to a CH group, leading to different splitting.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. So, for example, the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs (from the next CH2), leading to a triplet. But if those CH2s are further connected to other Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group between two carbonyls. So, the structure would be R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. In that case, each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs, leading to triplet coupling.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. So, perhaps the structure is a diketone, with Hs adjacent to each ketone.

So, let's imagine product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the Hs on the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones would be deshielded and would split into triplets because each is next to two Hs.

Wait, but in that case, each CH2 group would have two Hs, each of which is next to two others. So each H would be a triplet. But in the NMR, they would be a singlet or a quartet? No, wait, each H would couple with the two adjacent Hs on the same CH2, but the splitting would be a triplet because each H has two neighbors. Wait, no, a CH2 group's Hs are split by each other into a singlet. But when coupled with another CH2 group, each H would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps each H in a CH2 group is next to two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. Hence, the signal would be a triplet for each H in the CH2 groups.

But wait, in the NMR, the most deshielded H (like the one next to the carbonyl) would be the one in the CH2 next to the ketone. So, each H in that CH2 group would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Therefore, the answer would be option A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is adjacent to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH group, the coupling could be more complex. For example, in a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO-R', the H on CH2 would be next to a CH which has two Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to two different sets of Hs. For example, next to a CH2 and a CH. Then, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. But given that the options include triplet and triplet of triplets, I need to think about how the splitting occurs.

Let me try to visualize the scenario. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product with two carbonyl groups. Let's say product 3 is a diketone, with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. In this case, each CH2 group is flanked by two carbonyls. The Hs on the CH2 groups would be next to two Hs on the same CH2, but wait, in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent and split into a singlet. But when coupled to the adjacent CH2 group, each H would see two Hs, leading to a triplet for each.

Wait, but that's only if the coupling is between the two CH2 groups. So, each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet. So, the NMR would show a triplet for each CH2 group.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the one next to the carbonyl. So, in this scenario, those Hs would be part of a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Each H in that CH2 would be next to two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Hence, the answer would be option A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **First Reaction (Heating with KOH):**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH at 240°C.  
   - KOH likely induces elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a product with a carbonyl group, as indicated by the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, singlet for 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, multiplet for 10H; 1.94 ppm, doublet for 2H) suggests a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely a diketone or a compound with a carbonyl group, such as a cyclohexenone derivative.

2. **Second Reaction (Heating with Aluminum Isopropoxide):**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid commonly used in reactions like Friedel-Crafts or dehydration.  
   - Product 1, which contains a carbonyl group, undergoes further reaction to form product 2.  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it likely contains a double bond (alkene) since ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

3. **Third Reaction (Ozonolysis with Ozone and Dimethyl sulfide):**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing product 3.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - In the NMR spectrum of product 3, the coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens. If the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH₂ group, it would couple with two hydrogens, resulting in a triplet.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Patterns:**  
   - If the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH₂ group, it would couple with two equivalent hydrogens, leading to a triplet.  
   - More complex splitting patterns (e.g., triplet of triplets or doublet of triplets) would require additional coupling with hydrogens from adjacent groups, which is not supported by the given data.  
   - A pentet would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is unlikely in this scenario.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**. 

Answer: A
