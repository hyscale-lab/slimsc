Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states when measured.

So, the operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down as given.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, -i] and second row [i, 0]. That's the Pauli Y matrix, right? And Pz is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [1,0] and second row [0,-1], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because the x-z plane has angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane, so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. The operator P must be the vector sum of its components in the x, y, and z directions. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component (Py) would have a coefficient of zero. So the operator P would be P = (P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z) because n_y is zero. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli vector. So, the operator P = n · σ * (ħ/2), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. Because each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So for a direction n = (n_x, n_y, n_z), the operator would be (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz) multiplied by ħ/2. But in this case, n lies in the x-z plane, so n_y=0. So P = (n_x σx + n_z σz) * (ħ/2).

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n can be any direction where φ=0. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ±ħ/2. So the operator P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The question is about the eigenvector for +ħ/2.

So, the operator P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). But since P_x is (ħ/2) σx, and P_z is (ħ/2) σz, the entire operator would be (n_x σx + n_z σz) * ħ/2.

Let me write that as P = (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz). The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation becomes: (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>. Wait no, because (n_x σx + n_z σz) * (ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So when I multiply both sides by 2/ħ, I get (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, that's not right. Because (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> must
