Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. There's a lot to unpack here, so I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem states that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, that suggests that X is a compound where one of the elements has a heavier isotope. For example, maybe it's using deuterium instead of protium (like H2O vs. heavy water). But I'm not sure yet.

The reaction between X and Y is violent and releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of protons and neutrons. So each atom in W has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think: H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. But wait, the molecule's atoms have equal p and n. So, perhaps hydrogen has 1 p and 1 n? No, that would be deuterium, but the molecule as a whole would have certain properties.

Wait, no. Let me think about the molecule. The molecule should have same number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, maybe it's something like H2O? No, because H has 1 p, O has 8 p. But that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe H2 gas. Each molecule H2 has 2 atoms, each with 1 p and 1 n (deuterium). Oh wait, if W is H2 (normal hydrogen gas), each H atom has 1 p and 0 n. So that doesn't fit. Or if the H is deuterium, each has 1 p and 1 n. So the molecule would have 2 p and 2 n per molecule. So the molecule would have the same number of p and n. Wait, but the molecule's total p is 2 and n is 2. So 2=2, yes. That fits. So gas W could be H2, but then if it's regular hydrogen, each H is 1 p and 0 n. So that would total 2 p and 0 n for the molecule. That wouldn't fit. Hmm, maybe another molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is carbon monoxide (CO)? Let's see: C has 6 p and 6 n (if it's the isotope ^12C, which has 6 p and 6 n). O has 8 p and 8 n (if it's ^16O). So CO would have: C: 6 p, 6 n; O:8 p, 8 n. So the molecule would have (6+8)=14 p and (6+8)=14 n. So 14=14. That fits. So W could be CO. But what else? Alternatively, maybe it's nitrogen gas, N2. Each N atom has 7 p and 7 n (if it's ^14N). So each molecule has 14 p and 14 n. So that would fit. So W could be N2. But wait, what about other possibilities?

Wait, another thought: if the gas is carbon monoxide, the molecule would have 14 p and 14 n. But if it's nitrogen, each molecule has 14 p and 14 n. So both could fit. Hmm. So I'm not sure yet.

Next, the reaction forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above the melting point of water (0°C). Wait, no, 277 K is approximately 4°C (since 273 K is 0°C). But wait, actually, 277 K is about 4°C. Wait, melting point of something at 277 K. What substance melts around there? Let me think. For example, ice melts at 273 K (0°C). So if B's melting point is close to 277 K, maybe it's something that's solid at around 0°C. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid at room temp but melts a bit higher. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound that's a solid, like maybe a metal or something. Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate or another compound.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts at around 800°C. Wait, maybe B is a different kind of salt. Alternatively, perhaps B is some metal with a lower melting point. Let me think. Wait, another approach: the reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate G which upon heating gives B. So maybe G is some hydroxide that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, if X is a heavy isotope-containing substance, perhaps it's something like heavy water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal or a carbonate.

Another clue: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, a keto acid. That's a carboxylic acid where the adjacent carbon has a ketone group. Or perhaps a ketone group somewhere else. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is some kind of esterification or something else. Or maybe the reaction is a neutralization. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like NaOH, KOH, maybe Grignard reagents, or others.

Wait, Substance X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Let me think about common reagents. For example, NaOH is used in many reactions, like saponification. KOH is another strong base. But wait, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, if X is something like NaOH, and the keto acid is RCOOH with a ketone group, perhaps the reaction is neutralization. Wait, but the product would be a sodium salt, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium or potassium. Or maybe it's something else. Another thought: X and its analog are used as reagents. So perhaps X is a metal such as sodium or potassium, which is used in reactions like Grignard reagents. Alternatively, maybe it's something like THF or another solvent, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, going back to the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. So maybe X is a strong base, and Y is an acid. For example, if X is sodium metal and Y is water. Sodium reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. So that would fit. Let's see: X is sodium, Y is water. The reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2 gas. So W would be H2. Then, gas W is H2, which has 2 atoms per molecule. The H2 molecule: each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the molecule as a whole has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But wait, that doesn't fit the earlier condition of same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, unless the H is deuterium. Because if W is D2 gas, each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That makes the number same. So that would fit. So gas W is D2.

So, going back, if X is sodium, but wait, sodium would react with water to produce NaOH and H2. But wait, in this case, if X is a heavier isotope, perhaps X is something like sodium with a heavier isotope. Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy isotope-containing compound, like deuterated water?

Wait, but wait. The problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound that has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is NaOH, but one of the H's is deuterium. Or perhaps X is something else.

But wait, let's think about what happens when X reacts with Y. If X is sodium and Y is water, then the reaction produces NaOH and H2. But if Y is something else, like an acid, perhaps the reaction is more vigorous. Alternatively, if Y is an acid, then X could be a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and heating it produces CO2 and a metal oxide. Or perhaps G is a hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes. For example, if G is NaOH, but that's a solution, not a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, but the precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. Let's think about possible reactions. Suppose X is sodium carbonate, and Y is a solution of something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium, and Y is an acid. Wait, sodium reacting with an acid would produce H2 gas, and a salt. But if Y is a solution, perhaps Y is an acid solution, like H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and H2 gas.

Wait, but then the precipitate G would be the salt. If that's the case, then heating G (Na2SO4) wouldn't release anything, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the keto acid is reacting in a way that forms a molecule with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is reacting with a base to form a salt. Suppose X is a base, like NaOH. Then the product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid. The keto acid has a structure like RC(O)COOH. The sodium salt would be RCOONa. But how many oxygens are in that product? Let me count: R-C(O)-COO-Na. So, the acid has two oxygen in the ketone (C=O) and two in the COOH group. So when it's deprotonated, it becomes RCOO⁻ Na⁺. So, the product would have, perhaps, more than two oxygens. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps the product is something else. Let's think about the reaction of a keto acid with a base. A keto acid could undergo a condensation reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something that abstracts a proton, leading to a molecule with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, forming a molecule with two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid: CH3-C(O)-COOH. If it reacts with a base like X (maybe an alcohol?), perhaps it forms an ester. For example, acetoacetic ester. But that would have more oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the first part. Let's consider that W is H2, and the reaction between X and Y is a metal reacting with water, releasing H2. If X is a metal like sodium, and Y is water, then the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2.

In this case, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but that's a solution, not a precipitate. Wait, but if Y is a solution of something else, maybe? Or perhaps Y is not water but another liquid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is an acid, like H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce a salt, which could precipitate. For example, sodium sulfate is soluble, but maybe another salt is precipitated. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a nitrate or sulfate, and X is a metal that forms an insoluble hydroxide. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaOH, the reaction would produce AgOH, which might precipitate as AgOH or AgO. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe X is Ca, and Y is water. The reaction is Ca + 2 H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2↑. Then the precipitate G would be Ca(OH)2, which is a suspension but not a precipitate perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different solution, like a salt solution where the metal hydroxide precipitates.

Wait, perhaps Y is a salt solution where the anion is such that the metal hydroxide is insoluble. For example, if X is Zn and Y is a solution of NaOH. Then Zn + 2 NaOH → Zn(OH)2 + Na2↑? Wait, no, Zn reacts with NaOH to form Zn(OH)2, which is amorphous and may precipitate.

Wait, but let's tie this back to the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K. If G is Zn(OH)2, heating it would decompose to ZnO and water. ZnO has a melting point of around 1900°C, which is much higher than 277 K. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate. For example, if X reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate solution), producing a metal carbonate precipitate. Heating the carbonate would release CO2 and form the metal oxide. But the metal oxide's melting point needs to be around 277 K.

Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, which is very close to the melting point of ice. So perhaps B is something that's solid at 0°C but melts a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: B could be a solid with a low melting point. For example, paraffin wax has a higher melting point, but maybe something like camphor? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal with a low melting point. For example, mercury has a melting point of about 266 K (-8°C), which is lower than 277 K. But maybe another metal. Let me think: gallium melts at about 300 K (27°C). So it's higher than 277 K. But perhaps B is another substance.

Alternatively, maybe B is a compound that is solid at room temperature and has a melting point near 277 K. For example, maybe a certain type of salt.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering that if there are multiple isotopes, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. Wait, I think I got that wrong. The question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me read that again: "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So for each element in X, we take the lightest and heaviest isotopes and sum their masses, then add those two sums together. Or wait, perhaps for each element in X, we find the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, then add those for all elements?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element present in X, and then sum those together. So, for each element in X, find the mass of the lightest isotope and the heaviest, add them, and then sum all those for all elements in X.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements (in terms of atomic number) in X, but considering their isotopes.

Wait, the wording is a bit unclear, but perhaps the key is to figure out what elements are present in X, then take their lightest and heaviest isotopes and sum the masses.

But first, we need to figure out what X is.

Let me try to think again about the reactions.

1. X reacts with Y violently to produce gas W (same number of protons and neutrons in molecule).
2. A precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C).

If X is sodium, Y is water, then the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2. So W is H2, which would fit if W is D2 (each H is deuterium). Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but that's a solution, not a precipitate. Hmm, perhaps Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, like H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce Na2SO4 and H2 gas. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with an acid (Y is HCl). The reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O. So W would be CO2. CO2 has 12 p (from C) and 16*2=32 n? Wait, each O has 8 p and 8 n (if ^16O). So the molecule as a whole has 12 + 16*2 = 44 p, and 6 (from C: 6 n in ^12C) + 8*2 = 22 n. So 44 p and 22 n. Those are not the same, so W wouldn't fit. So that can't be right.

Wait, but earlier I thought W could be CO or N2. Let's consider if W is CO. Then, each molecule would have 12 p (from C) + 16 p (O) = 28 p. Neutrons: 6 (from ^12C) + 8 (from ^16O) = 14 n. So total p=28, n=14. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if W is N2, each molecule has 14 p (7 each) and 14 n (7 each in ^14N). So 14=14. That fits. So W is N2. But how would that happen? For example, when a metal reacts with an acid containing nitrate ions, perhaps releasing N2 gas. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, perhaps X is magnesium. Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas. So W would be H2, which again doesn't fit unless it's D2.

Wait, but let's think about another possible reaction. Suppose X is calcium, and Y is water. The reaction produces Ca(OH)2 and H2 gas. But again, the precipitate would be Ca(OH)2, which is a suspension but not a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. Then CO2 is released. But as earlier, that doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, perhaps W is another gas. Let me think of another molecule where total p = total n. What about CH4? No, each molecule has 6 p and 6 n? No, CH4 has C (6 p, 6 n in ^12C), and each H (1 p, 0 n). So total p: 6+4=10, total n:6+0=6. Not equal.

Wait, another possibility: O2. Each O atom has 8 p and 8 n (if ^16O), so O2 has 16 p and 16 n. So that would fit. So W could be O2. But how would that happen? Maybe in a decomposition reaction.

Alternatively, maybe W is O3 (ozone). Each O has 8 p and 8 n, so O3 would have 24 p and 24 n. So that fits. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it releases CO2 and forms a metal oxide. For example, heating Na2CO3 gives Na2O and CO2. But Na2O has a high melting point, around 1380°C, which is way above 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that decomposes. For example, heating Mg(OH)2 gives MgO and H2O. MgO has a melting point of about 2800°C, which is way higher.

Hmm, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. That's about 4°C. So maybe B is a solid that melts just above 0°C. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a sulfide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of compound.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product of the keto acid with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an esterification. For example, the keto acid could be reacting with an alcohol to form an ester.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of what X could be. X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, etc. Also, things like Grignard reagents (like Mg in ether), but those are more for forming organometallic compounds.

Another thought: X is a heavy isotope-containing substance. So perhaps it's a deuterated compound, like D2O (heavy water). But heavy water is a liquid, which would be Y perhaps.

Wait, if X is D2O, and reacts with Y, which is something like a metal. But I'm not sure. Or perhaps X is a deuterated acid.

Wait, let's think again. If X is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like D in a compound. Suppose X is NaOD, but that's probably not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where one H is replaced by D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps I should try to think about the options, and see which one fits.

The options are A) 35, B) 25, C) 31, D) 29.

These are all relatively small numbers. So perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X have atomic masses adding up to one of these.

Wait, for example, if X contains H and O, the lightest is H (1) and the heaviest O (16), sum is 17. Not in the options.

If X has Cl (35.5) and something else, but the options are 35. Hmm.

Wait, 35 is one of the options. Chlorine's atomic mass is about 35.5. So if X has Cl as the heaviest element and something else as the lightest, maybe H, then 35.5 + 1=36.5. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the heaviest element is Cl (35.5) and the lightest is Na (23), sum is 58.5. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the heaviest is something else. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something with two O's. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about X as sodium. Sodium's atomic mass is about 23. Then, if X contains sodium and another element, say, oxygen. Then the lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is O (16), sum 17. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. Sodium (23), O (16), H (1). So the lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is O (16) or Na (23). Wait, Na is 23, which is heavier than O. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Which is option B (25? No, 24 isn't an option). Hmm.

Wait, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. So 24 isn't an option, so maybe X isn't NaOH.

Wait, another possibility: X is a carbonate, like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12) or O (16)? Wait, no, the lightest element is C (6 protons, atomic number 6), but in terms of atomic mass, C is about 12, O is 16, Na is 23. So the lightest element is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. Oh, that's option A (35). But wait, the option is 35, which is option A.

But let me think again. X is Na2CO3. When it reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO2 gas (W). But earlier, I thought W should have equal p and n. CO2 has 28 p and 22 n, which doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. If X is sodium oxide (Na2O), reacting with Y (water) to form NaOH. Then, no gas is produced, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of X as a carbonate. Then, when X reacts with a strong acid, it produces CO2 gas. But as we saw, that doesn't fit the W condition.

Hmm, maybe I should think of X as a sulfite. Then, reacting with acid would produce SO2 gas. SO2 has 32 p (S:16 p) + 32 (O:16 each) → no, wait, each molecule has 16 (S) + 16*2 (O) = 16 + 32 =48 p. Neutrons: for S (32 → 16 n) and O (16 →8 n each). So total n =16 + 16 = 32. So p=48, n=32. Not equal. So W can't be SO2.

Wait, another possible gas: O3 (ozone). Each O has 8 p and 8 n. So O3 would have 24 p and 24 n. So that fits. If X reacts with Y to produce O3, but that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps W is Ne. But Ne is a noble gas, and each atom has 10 p and 10 n (since Ne has atomic number 10, and ^20Ne has 10 n). So W could be Ne, but I don't think the reaction would produce Ne.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W with equal p and n in each molecule, precipitate G which upon heating gives B with melting point ~277 K.

If W is H2, but each H is deuterium, then it's D2. So the molecule has 2 p and 2 n. That fits. So W is D2.

So, the reaction is X + Y → products + D2.

If X is a metal like sodium, and Y is D2O (heavy water), then the reaction would be 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + D2↑.

In this case, the precipitate would be NaOD. Wait, but NaOD is soluble? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different solution.

Wait, perhaps Y is an acid containing deuterium, like DCl. Then, X could be Mg. Mg + 2 DCl → MgCl2 + D2↑. So W is D2.

In this case, the precipitate would be MgCl2, but that's soluble. Hmm, not a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution with deuterium. For example, MgCO3 in DCl. The reaction would produce MgCl2, CO2, and D2O. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate. Let's say X is CaCO3, but that's a solid, not a reactant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxide. For example, CaO reacting with H2O (but that's Y). CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. No gas produced. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a strong deuterated acid. For example, Na2CO3 + 2 HCl (D) → 2 NaClD + CO2 + H2O. Wait, but that's speculative.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the product of a keto acid with X. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid reacts with it to form a salt. For example, a keto acid like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) reacting with NaOH would form the sodium salt, which has more oxygens, but I'm not sure about the count.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For example, the keto acid could undergo esterification with an alcohol (X), forming an ester with two oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is an acetal. Acetals have two oxygen atoms. So if the keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) reacts with a diol (X), forming an acetal. The acetal would have two oxygen atoms. But then X would be a diol, which is an organic compound, not a reagent in the same way as something like NaOH.

But the question says that X is a reagent in organic chemistry, which could fit for a diol in acetal formation. But I'm not certain.

Putting all this together, perhaps X is something like NaOH. But let's think about the elements in X. If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal like Zn. Zn has an atomic mass around 65. If X is Zn, then when it reacts with an acid, it produces ZnSO4 and H2. The precipitate G would be ZnSO4, which is soluble. Hmm, not a precipitate.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate, but I'm stuck.

Another thought: the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X has an isotope that's heavier than the standard. For example, if X is H2O with a heavier hydrogen isotope (D), making it HDO or D2O.

But if X is D2O (heavy water), and Y is a metal like Na, the reaction would be 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + D2↑. Then, the precipitate would be NaOD, but I'm not sure if that's a precipitate or a solution.

Wait, perhaps Y is an acid with D. For example, Y is H2SO4 with deuterium. Then, X could be Na2CO3. The reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O (with D). But again, not sure about the precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes. For example, if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating it would release CO2 and form Na2O. But Na2O has a high melting point.

Wait, but B's melting point is near 277 K. So maybe B is a different compound. For example, if G is Na2CO3, heating it would give Na2O and CO2. Na2O has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: what if G is a hydroxide that upon heating gives a metal oxide and water. For example, Al(OH)3 → Al2O3 + 3 H2O. Al2O3 has a high melting point, so that can't be B.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the options again.

Option D is 29. Let's see: the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X would be 29.

Possible combinations: for example, 13 (Al) + 16 (O) = 29. Or maybe 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) = 29? No, 12+17=29? 12+17=29? 12+17 is 29. So if X has C and Cl, sum would be 12+35.5 (Cl) = 47.5, which is not 29.

Wait, another combination: 14 (N) + 15 (O) = 29? No, 14+15=29? 14+15=29? 14+15 is 29, yes. So if X contains N and O, the lightest element is N (14) and the heaviest is O (16?), but 14+16=30, which isn't an option.

Wait, but wait: the lightest and heaviest elements, in terms of atomic number. For example, if X contains O (8) and Cl (17), but 8+17=25. Which is option B.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Suppose X is H2O with a heavier isotope, like D2O. The elements are H and O. H is the lightest, O the heaviest. So H has atomic mass ~1, O ~16. Sum is 17, not matching any options.

Alternatively, if X is something else, like NH3. Then elements are N and H. N has atomic mass ~14, H ~1. Sum 15. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X contains sodium and oxygen. Na is 23, O is 16. Sum 39. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that's an organic compound. The elements are C, H, O. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum 17. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains carbon and chlorine. C is 12, Cl is 35.5. So sum is 47.5, which is close to option A (35) but not exact.

Wait, perhaps X contains two elements where the lightest is 12 (C) and the heaviest is 17 (Cl). 12+17=29, which is option D. So the sum would be 29.

So maybe X contains C and Cl. For example, Cl is the heavier element, C the lighter.

So, if X is CCl4 (carbon tetrafluoride?), wait, no, that's CCl4. But does CCl4 react violently with a liquid Y? Not that I know of. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, like CHCl3.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate containing Cl, like sodium chlorate or something. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and make an educated guess. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Earlier, when considering X as Na2CO3, the sum of elements would be Na (23) and C (12), sum 35 (23+12=35), which is option A. But earlier, the reaction with acid would produce CO2, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH, the sum is Na (23) + O (16) = 39, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: what if X is something like NH4Cl? The elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is near option A (35). Not exact, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl. The elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5), sum 58.5. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's think again about the product of the keto acid with X having 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is an ester, which has two oxygen atoms in the ester group. For example, RCOOR', which has two O's. So when a keto acid reacts with an alcohol X, forms an ester. So X would be an alcohol.

If X is a primary alcohol, like ethanol, then the ester would have two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two O's. That fits. So X is an alcohol, used as a reagent in organic chemistry (which makes sense, as alcohols are used in esterifications).

So X could be ethanol (C2H5OH). The elements are C, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

Alternatively, X could be a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, ethanol has O, and the keto acid also has O. The ester would have more O's, so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the question says that the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a hemiacetal, which has two O's. For example, when a keto acid reacts with an alcohol, it can form a hemiacetal, which would have two O's.

So, if X is an alcohol, the product would be a hemiacetal with two O's. That fits.

So, if X is ethanol, the product would have two O's (from the hemiacetal). So, the elements in X would be C, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal like magnesium. The product of a keto acid with Mg would be a salt. For example, RCOO^- Mg^2+. The product would have O's from the acid. But I'm not sure about the O count.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an acetal, which has two O's. So X is a diol, which is used in organic chemistry as a reagent.

But diols are not typically used as reagents in the same way as, say, NaOH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base, and the product is a salt with two O's. For example, the keto acid has a structure like RC(O)COOH. When neutralized with a base, it becomes RC(O)COO^- Na^+.

But that product has three O's in the carboxylate group (O=C-O-), plus the O from the ketone. So, four O's. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is an anhydride, which would have fewer O's. For example, if the keto acid loses water to form an anhydride, which has two O's. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and try to look for which option fits the possible elements.

Looking at the options again:

A)35 → perhaps Na (23) + O (16) = 39 → no. Or Cl (35.5) + something light.

Wait, Cl is 35.5. If X has Cl and something else with a mass around 0, but that's not possible. Or maybe Cl and H: 35.5 + 1 = 36.5 → not 35.

Option D is 29. 29 could be 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) = 29. So if X has C and Cl, the sum is 29. So the lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Wait, but 12 + 35.5 is 47.5, which isn't 29. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So, for each element in X, take the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope, sum their masses, and then add all those together for each element in X.

Wait, perhaps the question is that for each element in X, find the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and then add all those sums together. Or, perhaps, for each element, sum the lightest and heaviest masses, and then add all elements' sums.

Wait, maybe the question is to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element present in X. For example, if X contains H and Cl, then for H, lightest is ^1H (1) and heaviest is ^3H (3), sum 4. For Cl, lightest is ^35Cl (35), heaviest is ^37Cl (37), sum 72. So total would be 4 +72=76. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to sum the lightest and heaviest elements (in terms of atomic number) present in X. So, for example, if X has C and Cl, the lightest is C (6) and heaviest is Cl (17). Their atomic masses are 12 and 35.5, sum 47.5 → not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of X as something like NaOH, which contains Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest Na (23). So sum is 24, which is not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, like H2O. The elements are H and O. Sum of lightest and heaviest isotopes: H (1) and O (16). Sum is 17.

Wait, I'm not getting any of the options. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is to sum the lightest and heaviest elements (by atomic number) in X, regardless of their isotopes. For example, if X has O and Cl, then O is lighter than Cl. So sum would be O (16) + Cl (35.5) = 51.5, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider other elements. Let's think about X being Ca. Ca has an atomic mass around 40. If X is Ca, then the lightest element is Ca itself, and perhaps another element. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, like K2CO3. Then elements are K, C, O. K's atomic mass is about 39, C is 12, O is 16. Lightest is C (12), heaviest K (39). Sum 51, not an option.

Wait, another angle: when you have a substance that upon heating gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. So B could be a solid that's just starting to melt, perhaps something like paraffin wax or another organic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal with a low melting point. For example, mercury has a melting point of about 266 K (-17°C), which is close. But 277 K is 4°C, so maybe B is a metal with a melting point near there. Let me think: gallium melts at about 29.76°C (302 K), which is a bit higher. Maybe another metal.

Wait, perhaps B is solid CO2 (dry ice), which melts at -78°C (195 K), but that's lower than 277 K. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a melting point near 4°C. For example, maybe camphor has a higher melting point, around 177°C.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking back, the only option that fits a sum of elements I can think of is option D)29. For example, if X contains N (14) and O (16), sum is 30, which is close to 29. Or perhaps X contains C (12) and something else with 17, like Cl. 12 +17=29.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X contains Na (23) and O (16), sum 39. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound that contains K (39) and O (16). So sum is 55, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should pick option C:31. How could that happen? Maybe X contains S (32) and something else lighter. 32 + (-1?) No, that can't be.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound containing Mg (24.3) and O (16). Sum would be 40.3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think that X is NaOH, the sum is Na (23) + O (16) =39, but no option. Alternatively, X is something else.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B is a carbonate, perhaps G is a metal carbonate that decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But the melting point of the oxide would need to be around 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the oxide is something like MgO. MgO has a melting point around 2800°C, which is way higher. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the oxide is a different compound. Maybe it's a hydroxide that upon heating becomes a metal oxide and water. But then the oxide's melting point is high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the elements in X that would sum to one of the options.

If the answer is D)29, then perhaps X contains C (12) and Cl (17). So 12 +17=29.

So, what's a reagent in organic chemistry that contains C and Cl? Maybe something like carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), but I'm not sure if it's a reagent or more of a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CHCl3. But again, not a common reagent.

Another possibility: X is a chloroform, but that's more of a solvent.

Wait, maybe X is a Grignard reagent, which contains Mg and an organic compound. But Grignard reagents are typically RMgX, so they contain Mg, R (carbon), and X (like Cl or Br). So the elements would be Mg, C, Cl. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Mg (24.3). Sum would be 36.3, which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, so I'll have to make a guess. Based on earlier thoughts, the sum of C (12) and Cl (17) is 29, which is option D. So I'll go with that.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and determining the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction and Gas W**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be H₂ (if deuterium is involved) or N₂, as both have equal numbers of protons and neutrons per molecule. However, H₂ (deuterium) is more likely given the context of isotopes.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: The reaction forms a precipitate G, which, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be a low-melting compound, such as a metal or organic solid.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X could be an alcohol or a base, as these can form products with oxygen-containing functional groups like esters or salts.

4. **Isotopes and Atomic Masses**: X incorporates a heavier isotope, suggesting it may involve elements with stable isotopes, such as hydrogen (H/D) or chlorine (Cl). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be calculated, considering all isotopes.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (35)**: This could correspond to elements like chlorine (35.5) and hydrogen (1), but the sum does not align with the reaction conditions or the melting point of B.
   - **Option B (25)**: This could correspond to elements like sodium (23) and oxygen (16), but the sum does not match the isotopic or reaction constraints.
   - **Option C (31)**: This could correspond to elements like sulfur (32) and hydrogen (1), but the sum does not fit the context of X.
   - **Option D (29)**: This could correspond to carbon (12) and chlorine (17), as their sum matches the given value. Additionally, X could be a compound like CCl₄ or CHCl₃, which aligns with the idea of incorporating heavier isotopes and being used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X sum to 29, corresponding to elements like carbon (12) and chlorine (17).
