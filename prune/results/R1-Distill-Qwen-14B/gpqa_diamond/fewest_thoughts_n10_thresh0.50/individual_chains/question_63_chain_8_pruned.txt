Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule, made of elements X and Y, modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. It's in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Hmm, right. So the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next higher energy state. But wait, in quantum mechanics, molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the transition could be either a vibrational or a rotational change, or a combination, I suppose.

Wait, the question says the photon is absorbed, so the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's looking for the minimal energy increase. That would probably be the smallest possible increment in energy. So perhaps the smallest quantum jump.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or maybe J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid or non-rigid rotor). But the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is also known as the rotation-vibration or HinderedRotor model?

Wait, no, the rigid
