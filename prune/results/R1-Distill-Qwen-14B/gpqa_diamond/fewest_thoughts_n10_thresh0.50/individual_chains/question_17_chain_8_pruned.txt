Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stability constant, K, tells us about the extent to which the metal and EDTA form a complex. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the metal is tightly bound.

So the Ca-EDTA complex is in solution. Let's denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is EDTA. The problem states the concentration is 0.02 M. Since it's stoichiometric, each mole of CaY²− gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA. But wait, in solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4− ions, right? 

Wait, no. Actually, the EDTA in the complex is in the deprotonated form, so the complex is CaY^2−. The dissociation would be CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. But wait, wait. No, the complex is [Ca(EDTA)]^2−, so the equation is correct.

The stability constant K (which I think is the formation constant, Kf) is given. K is equal to [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−]. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, the reaction would be Ca²+ + Y^4− ↔ CaY²−, and Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−})).

But wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. So K is this formation constant, I think. So, Kf is 5x10^10.

So, the solution contains 0.02 M CaY²−. Let's model the dissociation. Let me denote the concentration of CaY²− as [CaY²−]
