Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D.

Wait, in a normal, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is determined by energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (A) is (1/2)kA². That energy converts to kinetic energy at the equilibrium point, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy includes rest mass energy, so I think the energy equations get more complicated. Also, when speeds approach the speed of light, we can't ignore relativistic effects.

So, the oscillator's motion would still be periodic, but the speed can't exceed c. Let's think about energy in relativity. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this case, the oscillator is subject to a force F = -kx, which suggests it's a harmonic oscillator, but in the relativistic context.

Wait
