Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula is something like N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, parallax p is equal to 1 over the distance d, but in what units? Oh right, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, d (in parsecs) = 1/plx (in arcseconds). That makes sense.

So, the relationship between parallax and distance is d = 1/plx. So, plx = 1/d. Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx with 1/d, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as (d)^5. So, N is proportional to d^5. Wait, so N ∝ d^5. But wait,
