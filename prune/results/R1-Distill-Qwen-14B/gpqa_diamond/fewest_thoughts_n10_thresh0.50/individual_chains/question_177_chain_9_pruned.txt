Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. 

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, mass might not be directly relevant here since luminosity is more about the star's energy output, which depends on temperature and radius. Hmm, so maybe mass is a red herring, or perhaps it's related through something like the mass-luminosity relation, but let's see.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Since stars radiate as black bodies, the peak wavelength is determined by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because the b constant is the same for both. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's an important point.

Now, the radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But when calculating luminosity from a star, I think we're using the intrinsic properties (like radius and temperature) and not the observed flux that might be Doppler shifted. Or wait, no
