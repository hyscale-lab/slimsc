Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. So the question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. That might complicate things. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that when dealing with velocities, you can't just add them up normally because of relativity effects, but since the speed of light is always c in any frame, maybe that's the key here.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed in the medium. So in the glass, without any motion, the speed would be c/n. But because the glass itself is moving, does that affect how fast the light appears to move in the lab frame?

Oh, but wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer (wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but the observer is in the lab. Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer? Or the same direction as the light is moving toward the observer?

Wait the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the
