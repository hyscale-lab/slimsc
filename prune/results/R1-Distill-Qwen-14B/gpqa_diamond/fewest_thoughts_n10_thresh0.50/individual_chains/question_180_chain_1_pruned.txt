Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Wait, so the problem is about calculating the electrostatic potential energy of this system. Right, because in such cases, the potential energy is due to the arrangement of these charges.

Since all the charges are identical and positive (because each is 2e, and e is positive), they repel each other. So, the potential energy would be positive because bringing them closer would require work against the repulsion.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 charges is 2e and located at 2 m from P, which has a charge of 2e.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, that would be a charge of 2e at P, and the other 12 are each 2e at 2 m away. So, the system consists of a central charge and 12 surrounding charges.

I think the potential energy here is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.
