Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). They're asking about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are A to D, with different r coordinates. I'm not exactly sure what these r coordinates represent, but I think it's related to the Bloch sphere or vector representation of qubits.

Wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, which can be a pure state or mixed state. The given ρ looks like it's a mixture of the states |0> and |1>. Let me expand this matrix to see what it looks like.

Each term |n><n| is a projector. So, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in the bottom-right. So adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Then multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix ρ becomes:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ]

Wait, that's the same as the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix. Hmm.

Density matrices have some properties. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in that form, I can find r.

Our ρ is (I)/2. Let me compare that to (I + r·σ)/2. So,

(I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2

Subtracting, (I)/2 - (I)/2 = r·σ /2 → 0 = r·σ.

Which implies r·σ is zero. Since σ includes the Pauli matrices, which are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ = r_x
