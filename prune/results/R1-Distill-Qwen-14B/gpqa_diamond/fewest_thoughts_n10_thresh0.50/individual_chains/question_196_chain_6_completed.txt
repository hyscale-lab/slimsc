Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context.

Wait, a harmonic oscillator... right, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant, A is the amplitude, and m is the mass. But wait, the options include some with c, the speed of light, so this is definitely a relativistic problem.

I remember that in relativity, as speeds approach the speed of light, the mass increases due to relativistic effects. Oh right, the relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass, gamma being 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equations of motion change because the mass isn't constant anymore.

The force is given as F = -kx, just like in Hooke's law. But in relativity, Newton's second law isn't F = ma, it's F = d(momentum)/dt. Momentum p is gamma*m*v, so F = d(gamma m v)/dt. Since m is rest mass, F = m d(gamma v)/dt.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the force is proportional to displacement, so F = -kx. So perhaps we can model the equation of motion accordingly.

The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator might look different. But I'm a bit stuck on how to approach this. Maybe I should consider energy conservation, as that's often a good approach in such problems.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), all is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because of the gamma factor.

So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy (which is (gamma -1)mc²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but under relativity, perhaps things are more complicated.

Wait, maybe the energy should be considered in terms of relativistic mechanics. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely sure how the potential energy fits in here. Alternatively, perhaps the potential is treated as in the non-relativistic case, but the kinetic is relativistic.

Wait, maybe the total energy is conserved, so E_total = K + U. At maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all energy is potential. At that point, the speed is zero, so K is zero, and E = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in relativity, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA²? Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the potential is non-relativistic, and the kinetic is relativistic.

So at x=0, the speed is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. So the total energy is entirely kinetic. So E = K = (gamma -1)mc². Wait, but I think in some treatments, the kinetic energy is gamma mc² - mc², yes. So E = K = (gamma -1) mc².

But wait, the potential energy when x is maximum is (1/2)kA². So at that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². So:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but wait, because when x = A, all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA². At x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = K = (gamma v) mc² ? Wait, no, K is (gamma -1) mc². So, (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

So, solving for gamma, we get gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but this doesn't look right. Because when the amplitude A is zero, the system isn't moving, so gamma should be 1. Hmm, but if A is zero, then gamma would be 1, which is correct. If A increases, the right-hand side increases, so gamma increases, which makes sense as the speed increases.

So, from gamma, we can find v. Let's write gamma as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy expression. Because in the non-relativistic case, K is (1/2)mv², but in relativity, it's (gamma -1) mc². So when the system is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E is (1/2)kA². So:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

Yes, that seems correct.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic limit, when (k A²)/(2 m c²) is much less than 1, then gamma is approximately 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), but then the speed would be v_max = sqrt( (k A²/m) ) since when gamma is approximately 1, v_max is sqrt(k A²/m), which matches the non-relativistic case. That makes sense.

So gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). So we have:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So let's write that:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable for simplicity. Let's say that variable is delta:

delta = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So gamma = 1 + delta.

Thus,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + delta.

Now, let's solve for v.

Take reciprocal square on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c²) = 1/(1+delta).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + delta)^2.

Rearrange:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + delta)^2.

Factor the right-hand side:

v²/c² = [ (1 + delta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + delta)^2.

Expand (1 + delta)^2:

= (1 + 2 delta + delta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + delta)^2.

= (2 delta + delta^2) / (1 + delta)^2.

Factor numerator:

= delta (2 + delta) / (1 + delta)^2.

Hmm, but delta is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which for small delta (non-relativistic case), delta <<1, so delta^2 is negligible.

But perhaps we can proceed without that assumption.

So v^2 = c^2 * [ delta (2 + delta) ] / (1 + delta)^2.

But delta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so let's write that:

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Simplify numerator inside:

Numerator inside [] is (k A²)/(2 m c²) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Which is (k A²/(2 m c^2)) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Wait, perhaps this is getting a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor it differently.

Alternatively, maybe we can make an approximation, but I don't think we're allowed to unless the options suggest it.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C is v_max = sqrt(k A²/m), which is the non-relativistic case. But in our calculation, the correct relativistic speed should be higher than that, but looking at the options, perhaps option B or others.

Wait, but in the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²))) )

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the energy equation. Because in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be non-relativistic, so when x is maximum, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A².

But in the relativistic case, the total energy is E = gamma mc^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, E = gamma mc^2.

Wait, that's another approach. So, if the oscillator is a harmonic oscillator, then when the mass is at maximum displacement, the speed is zero, and all the energy is potential. So, the potential energy U is (1/2)k A². On the other hand, the total energy is E = gamma mc², which equals the potential energy plus kinetic energy. But at maximum displacement, K is zero, so E = U = (1/2)k A².

Wait, that can't be right because then E would be (1/2)k A² = gamma mc^2. So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but wait, that's different from before. Before I thought E = (gamma -1) mc^2, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let me make sure. In relativity, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So,

E = mc^2 + K.

But in the harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement, x=A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy K is zero. So E equals the rest energy plus the potential energy. Or wait, no, potential energy is part of the mechanical energy, but how does it fit in the relativistic framework?

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of rest energy and the non-relativistic potential energy. So,

E = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic, which is gamma mc^2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the mass is at x=0, the speed is maximum. So,

gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Ah, that's the same as before. So, the earlier approach was correct.

So gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Now, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), we have:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me rearrange this.

Let me write:

Let’s denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as delta, so delta = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + delta.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + delta).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + delta)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + delta)^2.

Which can be written as,

v²/c² = [ (1 + delta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + delta)^2.

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2 delta + delta^2 - 1) = 2 delta + delta^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ 2 delta + delta^2 ] / (1 + delta)^2.

Factor numerator:

delta (2 + delta) / (1 + delta)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ delta (2 + delta) ] / (1 + delta)^2.

But delta is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so substitute that in:

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can factor this expression differently.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator inside the brackets: (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, because 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) = (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²).

So,

Numerator becomes:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c² )

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c²)(2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator of v² is:

(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ) ]^2

= (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So putting it all together,

v² = c^2 * [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

v^2 = c^2 * [ [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ]

Hmm, the denominator's denominator is (4 m^2 c^4 ), and the numerator has (4 m^2 c^4 ), so they cancel each other?

Wait, let me compute:

Numerator of the fraction:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator of the fraction:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Wait, but (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) is 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor terms.

Wait, let me see:

The denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

The numerator inside the [ ] is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 (2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 )

But maybe I can factor 2 m c^2 + k A^2 as a term.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Not sure.

Alternatively, let me factor out (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ):

Hmm, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Let me write it as:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Because 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ). So,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

So the numerator becomes k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ].

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write v² as:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2) (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which can be written as:

v²= c² * [ (k A^2) ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps this can be split into two terms:

= c² * [ (k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) + (k A^2 * 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which is:

= c² * [ (k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 + (2 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = k A^2 / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Second term: 2 m c^2 k A^2 / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So,

v²= c² [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) + (2 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe this isn't the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (k A^2 ) from the numerator.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to take the expression for gamma and try to express v_max in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(gamma )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(gamma^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 (1 - 1/gamma² )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma² )

Now, substituting gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/gamma² = 1/( [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] )^2

Thus,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Hmm, let's write this as:

v = c sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which would be,

v = c sqrt( [ (1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) - 1 ] ) / denominator )

Simplify numerator inside the square root:

= c * sqrt( [ 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Factor numerator:

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps we can factor this expression.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express 1/gamma as:

1/gamma = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) = [ 2 m c^2 ] / ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

1/gamma^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = (4 m^2 c^4 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Wait, then the term 1 - 1/gamma^2 becomes:

( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 -4 m^2 c^4 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Expanding numerator:

(4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) -4 m² c^4 = 4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4.

So,

v² = c² * [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Factor numerator:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps factor 4 m c^2 +k A^2 as (2 m c^2) *2 +k A^2. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's see what the options look like.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m )) )^2 )

Wait, but denominator here is (1 - (k A^2/(2 m )) ), which seems to have units inconsistent with c². So probably option A is not correct.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c² )) ) )

Wait, the denominator is (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c² )) ), which is a dimensionless quantity. The expression inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - x ), which for small x would be approx 1 + 1/(1) )=2, but maybe that's not the right expression.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which we've established isn't considering relativity.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, that's similar to what we have.

Wait, our expression was:

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma² )

And gamma is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, let's check:

Option D says,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but I thought option B looked similar. Let me check.

No, option D is correct in terms of the structure.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the speed is zero, and all energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), the speed is maximum, and all energy is relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2 - mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), the total energy equals the relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2 = c^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**.

Answer: D
