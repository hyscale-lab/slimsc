Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question gives a couple of reactions and asks about their products. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, the Michael addition. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually a conjugate base, like an enolate. The nucleophile attacks the beta position, leading to the formation of an enolate intermediate, which then gets protonated.

So, looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, which can form a resonance-stabilized enolate.

The other part is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the beta carbon. Hmm, wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, maybe the substituent is on the alpha carbon? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so the positions are 1,2,3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? But that's the same as the ester group. Hmm, perhaps it's a propenoate where the substituent is on the second carbon. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So perhaps it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-C6H4-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-R, where R is p-tolyl. Or perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I think I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the substituent is on the beta carbon,
