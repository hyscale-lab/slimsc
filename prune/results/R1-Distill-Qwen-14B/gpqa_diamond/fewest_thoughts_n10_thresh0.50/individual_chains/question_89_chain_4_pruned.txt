Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide, leading to product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out what each product is.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent positions. When it's heated with KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it could deprotonate and eliminate HBr. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... elimination would lead to forming a double bond. Because when two adjacent bromines are present, elimination forms an alkene. Wait, but 1,3 might not be adjacent. Let me think, in adamantane, carbons are arranged in a diamond structure. So 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons? Or not? Wait, the structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So the 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps. So when you have two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads, heating with KOH would cause dehydrohalogenation, forming a bridgehead double bond. But I remember that bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule, which states that double bonds can't be at bridgehead positions in bicyclic systems. So maybe I'm wrong about elimination here.

Wait, but KOH could also induce an elimination reaction to form an epoxide? Or maybe it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, could it be a pinacol-type elimination? No, pinacol is vicinal diols. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination, but if the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads
