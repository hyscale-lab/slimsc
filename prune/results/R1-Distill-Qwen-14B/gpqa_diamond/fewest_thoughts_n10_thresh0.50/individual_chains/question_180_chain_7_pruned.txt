Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energy, we often use the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges. The formula for the potential energy (U) between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, we have multiple charges here. Since all the particles are identical, each has a charge of 2e. Let me think about what e is. Oh right, e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is about 3.204e-19 C.

Now, the setup is that the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So I'm picturing point P as the origin, and the 12 charges are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, for a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them. Since they are identical and all the same sign, bringing them together would require work because like charges repel each other.

But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained at a fixed distance, and the 13th is fixed. So I think we're only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, because the 12 are all fixed and not moving relative to each other. Or do I also need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges among themselves?

Oh, right! Because the 12 charges are all at the same
