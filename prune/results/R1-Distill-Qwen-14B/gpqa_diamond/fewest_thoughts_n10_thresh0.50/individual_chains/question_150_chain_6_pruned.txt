Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. The goal is to identify the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR peaks are as follows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Breaking this down:

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. High chemical shift like this is usually a carbonyl group, maybe an aldehyde proton. But wait, an aldehyde is typically around 9-10 ppm, yes. However, the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. That's a bit confusing because aldehyde protons usually don't have neighboring H's. Alternatively, maybe it's something else, like an enol tautomer or an acidic proton.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating for 2H. These are likely aromatic protons. Let me thinkâ€”maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if the ring has two substituents, then the protons would be in a doublet pattern. Wait, but each is a doublet of 2H. So perhaps two para-substituted rings, or one ring with two substituents.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange happening, like an acidic proton. Perhaps an enol proton or an -OH group. Or maybe it's a methine group adjacent to something else.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range of a methylene group, possibly attached to an electronegative atom. Maybe OCH2 or something similar.

Putting it together, perhaps the structure has an aromatic ring, some substituents,
