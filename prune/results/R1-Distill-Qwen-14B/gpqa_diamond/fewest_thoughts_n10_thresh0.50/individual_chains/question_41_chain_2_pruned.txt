Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium. Oh right! The speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, the speed of light in the glass would be c/n. But wait, in this problem, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Oh, right, because the glass is moving, we have to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Wait, but wait, this is a tricky point. If the glass is moving, then the speed of the light within it as observed in the lab frame would be affected by the glass's motion.

So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light's speed in the glass's rest frame is c/n. But in the lab frame, moving at velocity v relative to the glass, how do I combine these?

Wait, but in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/cÂ²). Wait, no, wait: the formula for velocity addition when moving
