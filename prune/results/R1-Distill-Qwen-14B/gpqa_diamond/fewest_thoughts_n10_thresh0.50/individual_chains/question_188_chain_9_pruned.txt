Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral crystals... I remember they have all sides equal and all angles equal, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice. In a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is primitive, right? Or maybe it's a face-centered cubic? No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal, and all angles are the same. So it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees each. The interatomic distance is given, but I'm not exactly sure how that ties in. Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length 'a' of the unit cell. Because in a simple cubic structure, the edge length 'a' would be the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps it's a bit different since the angles are not 90 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + kl + lh)/(a² cosθ), but wait, I think I'm getting that mixed up with something else. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's another formula. Let me recall.

Another approach: In a crystal system, the interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) can be calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. For a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, that's for a cubic system. But here the crystal is rhombohedral, so the formula is different.

Wait, the general formula for d-spacing in a crystal is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) [1/(cos α) - 1] or something like that? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the relation between the planes and the lattice parameters.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplan
