Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe after calculating, I can match the answers.

First, let me understand what's happening. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, the acid will donate a proton to the hydroxide ions, forming acetate and water. The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

I think I need to find two pH values: one when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and another at the equivalence point where all the acid has been neutralized by the base.

Let me start by calculating the moles of acetic acid before dilution. The volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L), and the concentration is 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol of acetic acid.

When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is moles / volume. 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, no, 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M? Let me check: 0.001 divided by 0.04 is indeed 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, during the titration, when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. Let's first find the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol as I calculated. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the titration is happening after dilution, so the volume is 40 cm³. Hmm, but the equivalence point is when moles NaOH = moles acetic acid.

So at equivalence, we have 0.001 mol of NaOH added. Now, but wait, this is when all the acetic acid has been converted into acetate. The solution at equivalence will consist of the sodium acetate in solution. So the concentration of acetate will be moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume. The total volume will be 40 cm³ (initial solution) plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence, which is 10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 mol because each mole of acetic acid gives one mole of acetate. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Now, since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), this will hydrolyze in water to form OH- ions, making the solution basic. So the pH will be above 7.

To find the pH, I can use the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The
