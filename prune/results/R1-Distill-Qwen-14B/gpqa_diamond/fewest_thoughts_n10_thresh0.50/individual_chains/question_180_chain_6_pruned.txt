Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let's read it again carefully.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't need to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just potential energy probably.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, I guess point P is the origin or center here. So, the setup is that one charge is fixed at the center, and the other twelve are arranged in some way around it, each 2 meters away.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. So, I'm thinking this must be the electrostatic potential energy. Because in an isolated system, the total energy would be the potential energy since there's no kinetic component here.

Wait, so I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of this configuration. How do I approach that?

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But when you have multiple charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, for a system of n charges, you calculate the energy for each pair and add them all up.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are 2 meters away. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 charges is a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. So, the energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, no, wait. Wait, each charge is 2e, not e. So, each charge is 2e. So, the product would be (2e)*(2e) = 4 e². And divided by 2 meters.

But wait, how many pairs are there between the 13th
