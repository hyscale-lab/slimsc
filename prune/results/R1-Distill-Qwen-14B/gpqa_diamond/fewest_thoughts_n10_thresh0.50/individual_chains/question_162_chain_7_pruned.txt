Alright, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric tensor is related to the geometry of the space. So this must be a 2-dimensional metric, probably on some kind of surface.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? It's like a tractricoid, the surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, the term pseudosphere could sometimes refer to other things too, but in this context, I think it's the hyperbolic one.

So, the area of a pseudosphere... I recall that for a sphere in Euclidean space, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which has negative curvature, the area might be different. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the metric given and how it relates to the pseudosphere.

Let me look at the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Wait, that looks similar to the metric for a sphere. Oh wait, in the sphere's case, the metric might have terms like (1 - (r²/R²)) or something, but here it's 4 - x² - y². Maybe it's in some scaled coordinates.

Wait, the metric could be representing a space with a certain curvature. Let me think
