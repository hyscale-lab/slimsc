Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a series of reactions leading to compound E, and I need to identify which of the given options it is. There are hints provided, and I should use them along with the reaction steps.

Let me start by outlining the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Also, there are two hints given:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the IR peaks. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an aldehyde. E's IR is at 1715, which is a bit lower. That might suggest a different type of carbonyl or maybe an ester, but wait, in the context of this problem, more likely another ketone but perhaps with more substituents affecting the stretching frequency.

Now, looking at the reactions. Let's think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl, adding HCN would probably form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but HCN can also add to something else. Alternatively, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group. But wait, maybe A is a cyclic ketone, and the addition of HCN would create a bicyclic structure? I'm not sure yet.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a cyclic ketone, and HCN adds to it in a
