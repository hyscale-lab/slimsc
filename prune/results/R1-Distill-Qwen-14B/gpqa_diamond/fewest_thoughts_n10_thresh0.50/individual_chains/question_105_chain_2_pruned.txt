Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of the area. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotted, photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots in and out of view. This setup is similar to the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the light curve amplitude. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius to produce the same amplitude signal?

Hmm. So I need to compare the change in brightness caused by the star's spots to the change caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The key here is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the signal (the dip in brightness) is the same amplitude.

First, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets works because when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The depth of the dip (the amplitude of the signal) depends on how much area the planet covers relative to the star.

Similarly, the star's dark spots would cause a dip in brightness when they are on the side facing us. Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness decreases. But because the spots cover only part of the hemisphere, the brightness variation is a periodic change as the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, but the question says that the star's situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when only one hemisphere is spotted, the light curve would vary as the star rotates, and the spots come into view. The amplitude of this variation should be the same as if a planet were transiting, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but the planet transiting would block a part of the star's light. The star's spots would cause a dip when they are on the surface facing us. So how does the brightness change in each case?

For the exoplanet, the dip in brightness is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. That makes sense because the area is πRp² for the planet and πRstar² for the star, so the
