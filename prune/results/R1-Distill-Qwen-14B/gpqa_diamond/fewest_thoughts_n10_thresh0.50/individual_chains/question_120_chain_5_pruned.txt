Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A to D, each with different exponents. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So p = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So bigger parallax means closer star.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, I think it's uniform in terms of space density. So the number density of stars doesn't change with distance. So in a region of space, the number of stars per volume is the same everywhere.

But wait, how does that translate to how we observe them? Well, when we look at the sky, the number we see in a certain direction depends on how far we can look. So perhaps the number of stars with a particular parallax depends on the volume they occupy.

Let me think about the volume. Parallax p is in arcseconds. The distance d is 1/p parsecs. So for a range of parallaxes from p to p+dp, the corresponding distance range is from d = 1/p to d' = 1/(p+dp). Wait, no, actually, when p increases (since p is inversely proportional to d), the distance decreases. So a small change in p means a change in d. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the volume per unit parallax.

Wait, perhaps I should model it this way: the number of stars per unit volume is n, a constant. So in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd, the number of stars is n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me write d in terms of p. d = 1/p → p = 1/d. So dp = - (1/d²) dd. Hmm, but I'm trying to express the volume in terms of p. So the volume element in terms of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 (1/(p²) dp). Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d² dd. But I want to express this in terms of p. Since d = 1/p, then d² = 1/p², and dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) ) → but the negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're considering a small positive dp, maybe I can ignore the sign for now. So 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, so the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit range of p is ~ 1/p^4. That would correspond to option A.

But wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me go through it again. The volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. The negative just means that as p increases, d decreases, so we can take the absolute value, so the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So when you look at the number per unit p (dp), it's proportional to 1/p^
