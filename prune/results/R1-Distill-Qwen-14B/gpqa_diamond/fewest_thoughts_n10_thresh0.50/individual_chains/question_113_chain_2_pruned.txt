Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas. I remember that each of these techniques gives specific information about the structure of the compound, so I need to analyze each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate the presence of either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines), but since the options don't have N, probably O-H. The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb around 1700. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or conjugated carbonyl, or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or something like that. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond, which can lower the wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. That might suggest something like an ester (if there's an oxygen and a double bond), maybe a ketone with a double bond nearby, or perhaps an aromatic compound. Wait, but wait: the presence of vinyl hydrogens might not necessarily mean an aromatic ring; it could just be an alkene.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments at 45 include the methyl group with some functional groups, maybe. Let me think. For example, the fragment could be CH3COO- (which is 60?), no. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is 45? Let me calculate. Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16.
