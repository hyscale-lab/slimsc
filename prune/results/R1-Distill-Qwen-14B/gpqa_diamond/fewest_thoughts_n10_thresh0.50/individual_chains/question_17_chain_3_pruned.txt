Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and they give me some parameters. 

Alright, let's parse the problem. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C and the pH is ideal, so I don't think pH will affect the stability of the complex. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Oh right, K here must be the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is.

So, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. Wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so the charge would be... Hmm, EDTA is usually in the form H4Y, but in solution, especially at a certain pH, it's deprotonated. Oh right, at high pH, it's Y^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So, the complex concentration is 0.02 M. But wait, in solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But since the complex is stable (a big Kf), most of the Ca and EDTA would be tied up in the complex.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So, I need to find [Ca²+] in the solution. Since the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, which has a concentration of 0.02 M, we can model this.

Let me think: Let's assume that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can express the dissociation. So, the complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this reaction would be 1/Kf, because the formation is Kf, so the dissociation is Kd = 1/Kf. 

Wait, no, the K for the dissociation would be Kd = 1/Kf. So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Because Kf is formation constant, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have Kd = 1/Kf.

So, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be the same, let's call them x each, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So, the dissociation equation is:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−] 

Plugging in what we know:

Kd = x * x / (0.02 - x) 

But wait, considering that Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, approximately,
