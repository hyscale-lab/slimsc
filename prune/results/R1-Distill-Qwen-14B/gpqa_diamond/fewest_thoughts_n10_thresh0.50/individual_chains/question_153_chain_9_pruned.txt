Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts, all involving Michael additions. I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, and the carbonyl is at the alpha-beta position.

Let's break down each part of the question.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH gives product A.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor. So, the reaction should proceed with the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Wait, actually, in a Michael addition, the nucleophile is the enolate ion (from a base like NaOEt deprotonating the alpha position). So the enolate attacks the beta position of the acceptor.

So the acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is: 

CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituent is p-tolyl. So maybe it's more like CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or is the acrylate part CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group at position 3? Hmm, maybe the structure is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 2.

Wait, the IUPAC name is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be at the third carbon of the acrylate. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-; so in acrylate, the carbonyl is at the end. So the positions are 1 (CH₂=), 2 (CH-), and 3 (COO-). So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl is on the carbonyl carbon? That doesn't make sense because the carbonyl is double-bonded. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH₂-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)=COOCH3. Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So, it's CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh, I think I get it. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the third is the carbonyl. So, the structure is
