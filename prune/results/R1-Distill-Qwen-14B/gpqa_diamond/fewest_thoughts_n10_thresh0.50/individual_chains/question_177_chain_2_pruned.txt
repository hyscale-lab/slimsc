Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. But wait, the mass might not matter here because luminosity for main-sequence stars is more related to mass, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. Hmm.

The problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is determined by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T changes, lambda_max would change. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but then what about their luminosities? Luminosity depends on radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both have the same temperature, the luminosity should depend on R squared.

Wait, wait. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So if we let R2 be the radius of Star_2, then R1 is 1.5 R2. So the luminosity of Star_1 would be (R1² / R2²) times the
