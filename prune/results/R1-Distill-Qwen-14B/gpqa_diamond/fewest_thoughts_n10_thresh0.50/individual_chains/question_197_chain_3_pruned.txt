Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product. The options are four different compounds, labeled A to D. 

First, I should probably figure out what Compound X is. The question provides IR and NMR data, so I'll start by analyzing those.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. 

I know that:
- The 3400–2500 cm-1 range usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.
- The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which aligns with the 3400–2500 region here. Wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 for a carboxylic acid? Or is it higher? I think carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone. But another peak at 1610 cm-1 might suggest conjugated carbonyls, maybe aromatic rings with substituents. The 1450 cm-1 could be C-O stretching or maybe bending vibrations.

Now the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – a broad singlet around 10 ppm is very likely an -OH proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. That fits with the IR's 1720 cm-1 as a carboxylic acid. So Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Other peaks in the NMR:
8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – these are typical for aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substit
