Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says we have two astronauts. The first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, relativistic speeds mean I can't just use classical mechanics. I remember that when objects move at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you have to use Einstein's theory of relativity, especially special relativity here.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. Wait, what's relative speed in relativity? I think when you want to find the speed of one object from the frame of another, you can't just subtract the speeds as you would in Newtonian physics. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' is (u - v) / (1 - (uv/c²)), but wait, I think I might have that a bit wrong. Let me get it straight. If object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v in the same direction, then the speed of A relative to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, I might have confused the order. Actually, if the observer is in B's frame, then u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, let me think. The astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and the astronaut B at 0.5c. So from B's perspective, what's A's speed? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says "relative speed", which I think is the speed of one as seen from the other. So, probably the speed of A as seen from B, or vice versa. Which one is it?

Wait, does it matter? Because in relativity, the relative speed depends on the frame. Oh, but wait, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of A from
