Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But how do I get those from the given parameters?

I think the lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for the particle's lifetime, the uncertainty in energy is the width Γ. So τ ≈ ħ / (Γ). But wait, it's actually Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in J·s, so I need to convert units properly.

Wait, also, the production energy E_X is 8 GeV. How does that factor in? Oh, because the particle is produced with some kinetic energy, which affects its velocity. So the velocity isn't just the speed of light, but depends on the energy.

The relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So γ would be E_X / (m_X c²). So γ = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Wait, but what's the relationship between γ and velocity? Oh right, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we can solve for v in terms of γ.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to calculate the velocity from the energy. Let me think: The total energy E is γ m c², so kinetic energy K is (γ - 1) m c². But maybe for the velocity, I can use the relation β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). That makes sense.

So let's compute β:

β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). γ is 8/1.2 which is
