Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Violent reactions can sometimes involve things like acid-base reactions, especially if Y is a liquid. For example, metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen gas. But I'm not sure yet.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the protons. So, each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas has H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Helium is He, single atom. Neutrons would be 2 (since He has atomic number 2, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons in He-4). So He has protons=2, neutrons=2. That fits. Could W be helium? But wait, is there another possibility?

Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? No, because NH3 has 1 N (14, so 7 protons, 7 neutrons) and 3 H (1 each). But the molecule as a whole wouldn't have equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe each molecule as a whole? The molecule's total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let's see: for He, each molecule is He, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That works. Another possibility is CH4? No, because CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4*(1) = 10 protons, and 6 neutrons (C is 12) + 4*0 =6. So 10 protons vs 6 neutronsâ€”nope. Not equal. What about O2? O has 8 protons each, so O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons: each O has 8 (since O is 16), so 1
