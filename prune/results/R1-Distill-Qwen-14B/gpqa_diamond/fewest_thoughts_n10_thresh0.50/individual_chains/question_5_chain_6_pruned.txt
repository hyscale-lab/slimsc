Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, an eigenvector of an operator corresponds to a state that only changes by a scalar factor when that operator is applied. So, the operator P acting on this eigenvector gives (plus ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, P is a vector operator, and the components are:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I think the operator we're concerned with is the component of P along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So, if n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be specified by polar angles theta and phi, but since it's in x-z, phi would be 0 or 180 degrees, I suppose? Wait, no, actually, if it's in the
