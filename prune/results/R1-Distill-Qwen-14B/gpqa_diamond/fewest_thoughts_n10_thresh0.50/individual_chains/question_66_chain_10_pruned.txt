Okay, so I have this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). So, the operators in SMEFT must obey the same symmetries as the SM.

Wait, what are the fundamental symmetries of the SM? I know the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Lorentz symmetry is pretty fundamental; all interactions in the SM are Lorentz-invariant. So the operators in SMEFT should definitely respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes option 1 correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Hmm, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like spatial and temporal). I think the SM is Poincare-invariant. So if SMEFT respects the SM's symmetries, then Poincare must be a symmetry as well. So option 2 (Poincare) must be respected. So far, I think options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy here. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in generalâ€”like in the case of certain processes, such as the CP violation seen in the CKM matrix. So, the SM doesn't enforce CP symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP. That means operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So option 3 (CP) is not a symmetry that must be respected.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. From what I recall, all Lorentz-invariant theories respect CPT symmetry. This is a big one because the CPT theorem states that any quantum field theory that is Lorentz-invariant must be CPT-symmetric. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry (which we already determined), then it must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poin
