Okay, so I have this physics question here about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct combination.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework that includes the Standard Model as a low-energy limit and adds higher-dimensional operators to account for new physics beyond it. The operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, symmetries... I remember that the Standard Model respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT probably maintains some of them. But which ones are absolutely necessary for any operator in SMEFT?

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because all the Standard Model interactions are Lorentz symmetric, and the effective operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant terms. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. But wait, SMEFT is a effective field theory, so it's formulated in a framework that includes Poincare symmetry. But wait, are all operators necessarily Poincare invariant? Because Poincare includes translations, which in EFT are handled via the background
