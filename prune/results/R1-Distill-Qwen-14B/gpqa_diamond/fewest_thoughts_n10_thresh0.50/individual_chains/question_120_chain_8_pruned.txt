Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about this.

Alright, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. I remember that the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax (plx), so distance d = 1 / plx. Wait, but wait, no, actually, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, right? So plx is in arcseconds, and the distance d is in parsecs.

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions, but I'm not sure about the distance. Wait, uniform distribution in space would mean that the number of stars in a certain volume doesn't depend on where you look, but since we're on Earth, we see stars at different distances. Oh wait, no, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So maybe it's more about the volume of space for that particular parallax range.

So, the number of stars we observe would depend on the volume of space between certain distances. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a shell depends on the volume of that shell. The shell's volume is 4/3 Ï€ (d_outer^3 - d_inner^3) or something like
