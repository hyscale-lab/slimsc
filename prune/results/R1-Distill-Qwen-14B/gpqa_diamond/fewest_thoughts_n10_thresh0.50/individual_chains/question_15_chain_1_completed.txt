Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one with Planet_2.

Wait, so host star mass and radius are different. Let me think about how that affects the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like P = R_p / (R_s + R_p), where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius. But wait, for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so the probability is approximately R_p/(R_s). But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star... Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) is given by the formula P = (R_s + R_p) / a, where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a is larger, the probability is smaller, since the orbital plane has to be edge-on. So the probability is actually higher when the star is larger because the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. Because the star's size defines the area where the planet can transit. So if a is the semi-major axis, the probability is (R_s) / a multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe the formula is more accurately given by (R_s + R_p) / a. Because the transit occurs when the planet's orbit is within a certain cone of the star's position as seen from Earth. The formula might be:

P = (R_s + R_p) / a

But I might have that backwards. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_s / a). Because the relative size of the star to the planet's orbit determines this. If the planet is very far away (a is large), the chance that we see a transit is smaller.

Wait, no. I think the correct formula is P = (R_s + R_p) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)), but in this case, e is zero because both orbits are circular. So P = (R_s + R_p) / a.

But wait, for Earth-sized planets and stars, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so we can approximate this as R_s/a. So the probability is proportional to R_s / a.

But wait, the problem says that the host stars have the same radii. Oh! So R_s is the same for both. Because both stars have the same radii. So the only variable in the transit probability formula is a, the semi-major axis.

So if R_s is the same for both, then the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with a smaller a (shorter orbital period) has a higher transit probability.

Wait, because the period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. For a star of mass M, the period P is related to a by P^2 = (4π²/GM) a^3. So for a given M, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a increases with period.

So for Planet_1, the period is P1 = P2 / 3. So a1 = (P1^2 / (M1)) ^ (1/3) * some constant. Wait, maybe I should write this down.

Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M + m)) / (4π²). Since the planet mass m is negligible compared to the star's mass M (as with Earth-like planets), we can approximate a^3 / P^2 = G M / (4 π²).

So a ∝ (M)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So for Planet_1, the period is P1 = P2 /3. The star's mass is M1 = 2 M2. Planet_2's star is M2.

So a1 is proportional to (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) = (2 M2)^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3) = (2)^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * (P2^(2/3))/(3^(2/3)).

a2 is proportional to M2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3).

So a1/a2 = [ (2)^(1/3) * 1/(3^(2/3)) ) ] = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 (since 0.6^3 is 0.216). So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star, but the period has a bigger effect.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

a1 / a2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, no, the formula for a is proportional to (M)^(1/3) * P^(2/3). So a1 = (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3).

Similarly, a2 = (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3).

So a1/a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2) ) ]^(1/3)

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So (M1/M2) = 2; (P1/P2) = 1/3 → (P1^2 / P2^2) = (1/3)^2= 1/9.

So a1/a2 = [ 2 * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3).

What's 2/9? Approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606, as 0.6 cubed is 0.216, which is close.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to R_s / a, and R_s is same for both, P1 (Planet_1) has a higher transit probability than P2.

Wait, because a1 is smaller than a2, so R_s/a1 is bigger than R_s/a2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the probability is inversely proportional to a. So since a1 is smaller, P1 has higher probability.

But wait, let me double-check. If a planet is closer to its star (smaller a), the chance that its orbit is aligned to pass in front is higher. Because the star appears larger in the sky, so a larger fraction of the possible orbital planes would result in a transit.

So yes, transit probability is higher when a is smaller, given same R_s. So Planet_1, with a smaller a, has a higher probability.

But what about the other factors? Do the planet sizes matter? Wait, both are Earth-like, so R_p is the same for both planets. So R_p cancels out in the probability.

So the transit probability for each planet is approximately (R_s + R_p)/a. Since R_s is same for both and R_p is same, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So, P1's a is ~0.6 a2 → P1's transit probability is higher than P2's by a factor of 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666 times.

So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability to transit than Planet_2.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability, and option D says 2.7 times, which is much higher.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let's compute a1 and a2 precisely.

Given that a is proportional to (M)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

a1 = (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3)
a2 = 1 * 1

So a1 = 2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) = (2)^(1/3) * (3^(-2/3)) ) = (2/3^2)^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1/a2 ≈ 0.606.

So transit probability P1/P2 = (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So yes, about 1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options, option C states that Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option C is: "C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_s}{a} \), where \( R_s \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The problem states that both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), so the probability depends inversely on \( a \). 

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M^{1/3} P^{2/3} \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axis ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \). For Planet_1, the host star's mass is \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), and the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{2}{1} \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{1/3}{1} \right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 2^{1/3} \cdot (1/3)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability by a factor of:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.
