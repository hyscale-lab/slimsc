Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with spin states and operators. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, the first thing I should probably do is normalize this state. Because in quantum mechanics, states need to be normalized, meaning their total probability is 1.

So, |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. But it's proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor. The normalization is done by taking the inner product of the state with itself and then dividing by its square root.

Wait, let's write that out. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), since up and down are orthonormal. Wait, no, actually, the inner product would be the sum of the products of each component's conjugate and the component of the other. Since the state is (a|up> + b|down>), the inner product is a* a + b* b. So, a is (1+i), b is (2 -i). So, a* is (1-i), and b* is (2 + i).

So, the normalization factor squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's calculate that.

|a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 + i -i -i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.
Similarly, |b|^2 = (2 - i)(2 +i) = 4 +2i -2i -i^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. So total is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, I assume. So the operator A looks like this:

A = [ [0,
