Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, the question is about a molecule in its fundamental state absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. I need to find the momentum of the photon.

Alright, let's break this down. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the rotation-vibration model is a combination of rotational and vibrational energy levels. So, the molecule's energy states are quantized both for rotation and vibration.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0. And for rotation, the fundamental state is the lowest rotational level, which is usually the J=0 state, but wait, sometimes it's the lowest J=1? No, no, I think J starts at 0, but for rotation, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the ground state for rotation is J=0.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the molecule is currently in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest possible energy state. So, the next possible state would be the next higher energy state, perhaps the first excited state.

Now, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state, a higher rotational state, or a combination of both. But the question is about the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That suggests the smallest possible energy increment, which would probably be due to a change in the vibrational state because the vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than rotational ones. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the vibrational energy spacing is larger than rotational spacing. So if the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0, maybe), the next state could be either increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (v=0, J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the vibrational energy levels have higher spacing, so the rotational transition would require less energy. But wait, how does that work?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib
