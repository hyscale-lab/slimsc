Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric since it's only in terms of dx and dy. But wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, which is a solution to the Einstein field equations in certain cases. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the metric is in 2D, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no—pseudosphere is a 2D surface, but maybe embedded in 3D. Or maybe here it's talking about the area in this metric. Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. But wait, the metric given is in terms of x² + y², so maybe it's related to a 2D space with some radius. Let me think.

Wait, the metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²). So the denominator 4 can be thought of as (2)^2, since 2 is the radius. So when r=2, let's see. Maybe the metric is for a space of radius 2. Wait, but pseudospheres have negative curvature, so maybe this is an anti-de S
