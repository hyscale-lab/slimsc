Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to work through, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so after figuring out the calculations, I'll have to match my answers to the options.

First, I think I should find out the initial concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a titration between a weak acid and a strong base.

So, initial step: Calculate the concentration after dilution.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³.

The formula I remember for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.04 L.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base), producing acetate (CH3COO^-) and water.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Molarity (M) = moles / volume (L), so moles = M * V.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Now, for the equivalence point, we need to add moles of NaOH equal to 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So for each part, I need to find the pH.

First, let's tackle 25% titration.

25% of the equivalence point volume. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the acetic acid solution.

Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Now, calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by 0.00025 each.

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 moles.

Moles after adding NaOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

So the solution now is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

First, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.85e-5 is the Ka. So pKa is log inverse.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So -log(1e-5) is 5, so pKa is 4.74 (since 1.85 is 10^0.267, so 5 - 0.26
