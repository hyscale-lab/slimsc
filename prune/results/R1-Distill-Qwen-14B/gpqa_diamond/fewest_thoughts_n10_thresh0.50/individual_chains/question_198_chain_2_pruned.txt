Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, β (beta) is the formation constant, which tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands. The stability constants are for Co(SCN) with n=1 to 4. But wait, the question specifies the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So I'm looking for the percentage of Co(SCN)₂²+ in the mixture.

I remember that when multiple complexes are possible, the distribution depends on the concentration of the ligand and the stability constants. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up to 100%.

The species present are Co²+ (free ion), CoSCN+, Co(SCN)₂²+, Co(SCN)₃³+, and Co(SCN)₄^4- (since each SCN- is -1, so 4 would make -4; Co is +2, so overall charge -2? Wait, no, wait: Co²+ with 4 SCN- would be Co(SCN)₄^4-? Wait, no. Each SCN- is -1, so four would be -4. Plus the +2 of Co gives a total charge of -2, so Co(SCN)₄^2-. Wait, maybe the charges go in steps. Let me think about the general formula.

Wait, but maybe it's better to approach this with the concept of the formation of each complex step by step. The formation of each complex from the previous one involves adding one SCN-.

The general approach is to model the fraction of each complex in solution. The fraction of each complex can be found using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

I think the formula for the fraction of a complex is based on the conditional formation constant, which considers the ligand concentration. But wait, the standard approach is to use the log terms.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands can be expressed as:

f_n = [β_n * [Co]_total * (SCN^-)^n] / [sum over m=1 to 4 of β_m * [Co]_total * (SCN^-)^m ]

Wait, actually, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂²+] + [Co(SCN)₃³+] + [Co(SCN)₄^4-]? Or wait
