Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth, right? And the formula for distance is something like distance = 1/parallax (in parsecs, I think). Oh right, the formula is d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax in arcseconds.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. But the question asks about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I need to relate this to distance. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, I can substitute plx with something involving r. Let me write that down.

Given: plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So, 1/plx would be d. So N ∝ (d)^5, because N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is (d)^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Oh wait, no. The number of stars in a region depends on the volume, I think. Because more volume would mean more stars, assuming a uniform distribution. Wait, but here the number is varying with parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars observed in a region of the sky as a function of parallax. So N varies as 1/plx
