Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the operator P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. And we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, so the operator here is the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, right? Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 systems. So the operator P is like the spin angular momentum operator scaled by ħ/2. So the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2, which makes sense.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, meaning it's arbitrary but lies in x-z, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi would be zero since it's in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since φ is zero, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

The operator P is given in terms of its components. So the vector operator P would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction unit vector. So the operator in the direction n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

So to find the eigenvector, I need to compute P · n and then find its eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane, so the eigenvector will depend on the angles θ and φ. But since n is in x-z, phi is zero, so in this case, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So let me write out the matrices for each component. Let me recall each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when I construct P · n, it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z because n_y is zero.

So P · n = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let's compute that. Let's denote (n_x, 0, n_z) as the direction vector, normalized so that n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So combining the matrices, the (1,1) element is (n_z)(1) from P_z, the (1,2) element is (n_x)(1) from P_x, the (2,1) is (n_x)(1), and the (2,2) is (n_z)(-1).

So P · n is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P · n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

So we have:

(
