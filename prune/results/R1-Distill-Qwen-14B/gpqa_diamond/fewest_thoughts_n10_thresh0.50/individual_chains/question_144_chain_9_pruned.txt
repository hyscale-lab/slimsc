Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy, mass, and width. Right, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity.

Wait, the formula for mean decay distance is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta c). Oh right, because the particle moves at velocity v, so the distance it travels before decaying is v times tau, which is beta c times tau.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh, right, the lifetime is related to the width via the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the energy uncertainty, which is ΔE. The relation is Γ = ħ/tau. So tau is ħ divided by Γ. Oh wait, no, wait: Γ is the width, which is the total decay width. The lifetime τ is actually given by the inverse of the width, but I have to be careful with units.

Wait, let me think. The formula should be τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units matter here. ħ is in J·s, Γ is in GeV. So I need to convert GeV into J to make the units work.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to use natural units where ħ = c = 1, but I have to convert back to SI units at the end. Hmm, but maybe I should proceed step by step.

So, let's jot down the given data:
