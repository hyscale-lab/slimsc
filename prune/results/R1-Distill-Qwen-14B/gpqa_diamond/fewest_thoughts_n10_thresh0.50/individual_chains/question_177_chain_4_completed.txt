Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me jot down the details.

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosity using the black body radiation, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. Or maybe it's a red herring. I'll have to see.

The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength due to black body radiation, which is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. So, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait a minute: no, because they have different sizes and masses but same peak wavelength. So, same temperature.

Wait, no. Because if they're the same size, same temp, then their luminosities would be different, but here the same peak wavelength implies same temperature. So, same T.

Wait, but radii are different. So, Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2.

But since they're black bodies, luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4, where R is radius and T is temperature.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

But since their peak wavelengths are the same, T1 = T2. So T cancels out.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2)/(R2^2) = (1.5 R2)^2 / (R2^2) ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So the ratio would be 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem also gives radial velocities. Oh, right! The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. Hmm, how does that affect things? Because when stars are moving, their observed wavelengths shift due to the Doppler effect. So, maybe the observed wavelength isn't the rest wavelength.

Wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both is the same. But if the stars are moving, their actual emitted wavelengths would be different.

Oh, right, because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. So the observed λ_max is different from the rest λ_max.

Wait, but in our case, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, for Star_1, if it's not moving (radial velocity 0), then its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, let me think.

So, the observed wavelength λ_observed is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest via the Doppler shift formula. The formula for redshift z is (λ_observed - λ_rest)/λ_rest. But wait, radial velocity can be either approach or recession. If the star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, so λ_obs < λ_rest. If moving away, redshifted, so λ_obs > λ_rest.

In our case, Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. But we don't know if it's moving towards or away. The problem just says radial velocity is 700 km/s. Hmm. But wait, the problem doesn't specify direction, but the way luminosity is calculated depends on their actual temperatures, not the observed ones.

Wait, but the calculation of luminosity is based on the star's actual properties, not the observed ones. So the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption, so they would have used the star's actual temperature, not the observed due to Doppler shift.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both is same. So, for Star_1, which has v_r = 0, λ_max_observed is equal to λ_max_rest (since there's no Doppler shift). So T1 = b / λ_max_observed.

For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, λ_max_observed is same as Star_1. But what's its actual λ_max_rest?

So, using the Doppler shift, λ_max_observed = λ_max_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), assuming non-relativistic speeds. But wait, v_r is 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% the speed of light (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So, maybe the approximation can be made.

But let me think: the Doppler formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer. If the source is moving away, v is positive. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), approximately, for small v.

Wait, more accurately, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But if v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated as 1 + v/c. So, but if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). If moving towards, λ_obs = λ_rest / (1 + v/c).

But in our case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away. So, λ_obs = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v/c). But Star_1's λ_obs is λ_rest,1, since v_r =0.

But in the problem, both λ_obs are same. So, λ_obs = λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_2/c).

Wait, no, the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1: λ_obs = λ_rest,1 (since no motion). For Star_2: λ_obs = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_2/c) [assuming receding]. But λ_obs is same for both stars, so λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_2/c).

So, λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / (1 + v_2/c).

But since T is inversely proportional to λ_rest, the temperature of Star_2 would be higher than Star_1.

Wait, because λ_rest,2 < λ_rest,1, so T2 = b / λ_rest,2 > T1 = b / λ_rest,1.

That complicates the calculation because T isn't the same as previously thought.

Wait, this changes everything. Initially, I thought T1 = T2 because λ_observed is same. But no, because one is moving and the other isn't.

So, in reality, the actual temperatures of the stars would be different because their rest wavelengths are different. So, T1 = b / λ_rest,1, T2 = b / λ_rest,2.

But since λ_observed is same for both, and λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1, and λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2/c), because Star_2 is moving away.

Wait, let me get the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength. The correct formula for a source moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for approaching).

But wait, that's the non-relativistic approximation. The exact relativistic formula is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v_r/(c)) / (1 - v_r/(c)) ), but for small v, it's approximately 1 + v_r/(c).

So, for Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, v_r =700 km/s. Let's compute the factor.

v_r =700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s.

v_r / c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333...

So, approximately, 0.2333% of c.

So, the Doppler factor is approximately 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So, λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1.002333).

But the observed λ_max for both stars is same, so λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * 1.002333.

So, λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / 1.002333.

Which means T2 = (b / λ_rest,2) = b * 1.002333 / λ_rest,1 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is about 0.233% higher than T1.

Wait, but that's a very small difference. So, when calculating luminosity, which depends on R² T⁴, this small difference might make a noticeable impact on the luminosity ratio.

So, let's compute L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2 = (2.25 R2^2).

So, (R1^2 / R2^2) = 2.25.

And (T1 / T2) = 1 / (1.002333) ≈ 0.99767.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.99767^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995346.

Then square that again: (0.995346)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004654)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004654 + (0.004654)^2 ≈ 0.99069 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.99071.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99071.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but let me think again. The question states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, 2.23 is approximately the ratio, which is option D.

But wait, I think I might have messed up the Doppler shift. Because Star_2 is moving away, which would cause its observed wavelength to be longer than its rest wavelength. But in the problem, both observed wavelengths are same. So, Star_1's observed is longer than Star_2's rest? Or the other way around.

Wait, no, no. The observed λ for Star_2 is λ_rest,2 multiplied by (1 + v_r / c). So, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer than its rest λ. But the problem states that both observed λ_max are same as Star_1's. So, since Star_1's observed λ is its own rest λ (since v_r =0), Star_2's observed λ is longer than its own rest λ. So, Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's observed λ, which is Star_1's rest λ.

So, λ_obs_2 = λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1.

But λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v_r / c).

So,

λ_rest_2 = λ_obs_1 / (1 + v_r / c) = λ_rest_1 / (1 + 700e3 / 3e5).

Wait, 700e3 m/s divided by 3e5 m/s is 700e3/(3e5) = 700/(300) = 2.333...e-3.

So, 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So, λ_rest_2 = λ_rest_1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767 * λ_rest_1.

So, Star_2's rest λ is shorter than Star_1's rest λ, so its temperature is higher.

Which means when we calculate luminosity, which depends on T^4 and R^2, the ratio would be (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But T2 is higher than T1, so T1^4 / T2^4 is less than 1, which reduces the luminosity ratio.

So, L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which is (2.25) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

But T2 is higher than T1, so T1 / T2 is less than 1. As computed earlier, it's approximately 0.99767.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227, which is about 2.23, option D.

So, the answer should be D. The initial approach didn't consider the Doppler shift, which would have given 2.25 (option A), but including the Doppler effect (Star_2 moving away, so its rest λ is shorter, higher T), reduces the luminosity ratio to ~2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem provides the following key details:

1. **Radius and Mass Ratios**: Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. Since the mass is not directly relevant to the luminosity calculation, we focus on the radius and temperature.

2. **Observed Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) at which they appear brightest. This implies that their observed temperatures \( T_{\text{obs}} \) are the same. However, due to the Doppler effect, the rest wavelengths \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) of the stars differ.

3. **Doppler Shift**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength equals its rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \)). Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which causes its observed wavelength to be redshifted. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for small velocities:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   where \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Approximating for small \( v/c \), we get:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), it follows that:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{1 + v/c}
   \]

4. **Temperature Relationship**: The temperature of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its rest wavelength (\( T \propto 1/\lambda_{\text{rest}} \)). Thus:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} / (1 + v/c) \), we find:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]
   For \( v/c = 700/300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), this gives:
   \[
   T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_1 \cdot 1.002333}\right)^4
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
   \]
   Approximating \( (1/1.002333)^4 \approx 0.9907 \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.23
   \]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
