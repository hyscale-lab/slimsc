Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, so I guess that means their density is the same everywhere in space. But wait, how does that translate to the number of stars per unit range of parallax?

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance d (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to the parallax plx (in arcseconds), so d = 1/plx. Oh right, that makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit of parallax (like per 0.1 arcseconds or something) changes with plx. So I need to find the number of stars in a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, I think.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is constant. That means the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume itself. Let's see, the number density n is constant.

So, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be n * (volume of the shell). The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd, right? So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we need this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dd is the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me
