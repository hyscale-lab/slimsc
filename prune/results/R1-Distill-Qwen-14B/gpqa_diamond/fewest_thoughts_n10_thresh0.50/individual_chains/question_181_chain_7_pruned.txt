Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Wait, I remember that the pp chain in the Sun produces neutrinos, right? The pp-III branch... oh right, the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which fuses protons into deuterium, then into helium-4. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which involve higher energy states of helium-3. 

So, the pp-III branch stops. That means the reactions that produce neutrinos from that branch will stop. But what kind of neutrinos are we talking about here? Oh right, the pp chain produces electron neutrinos (νe) via the reactions where a proton captures a positron, or in the case of the pp-III branch, maybe the beta decays in the He-3 branch?

Wait, in the pp-III branch, the steps would involve He-3 and He-4. Let me think. The pp-III branch is about the fusion of two He-3 nuclei into a He-4 nucleus. But wait, no, wait. The main pp chain is He-4 formation via two different branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, where two He-2's (deuterons) combine to make He-4. The pp-II and pp-III are about He-3 captures.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp chain's main neutrino production comes from the branch where a proton captures a positron, converting into a neutron and emitting a νe. That's the main source of solar neutrinos, right? But the different branches would contribute differently to the neutrino flux at different energies.

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that specific branch would cease. So, what's the contribution of the pp-III branch to the overall neutrino flux at different energy bands?

I think the neutrino energies produced in the pp-III branch are higher than those in the pp-I branch. Because in the pp-III branch, the reactions involve higher masses or energies. For example, the beta decay in the He-3 process emits higher-energy neutrinos. So,
