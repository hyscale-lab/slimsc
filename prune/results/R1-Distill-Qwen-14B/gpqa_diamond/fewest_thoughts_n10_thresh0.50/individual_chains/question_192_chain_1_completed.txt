Okay, so I'm facing this physics problem, and I need to solve it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity is a smaller sphere with radius r. The center of the cavity is s distance apart from the center of the conductor, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor. 

A small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each with a different expression for E. 

Hmm, so I need to find the electric field at point P. Let's think about how charges distribute in such a setup.

I remember that when a conducting sphere is uncharged, and a charge is placed inside its cavity, the conductor's response depends on whether it's a hollow or solid conductor. Since this is a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the conductor will redistribute. 

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so it has zero net charge. When we place a charge +q inside the cavity, the induced charges will appear on the inner and outer surfaces. 

Right, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) will induce a charge of -q because the conductor is a conductor, and the charges will rearrange to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

Oh wait, the conductor is neutral, so when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) will have a charge of -q (opposite to +q) to shield the conductor's material from the electric field. Then, since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner has -q.

But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor?

I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends on the total enclosed charge. So, for the conductor as a whole, the charge enclosed within its volume is zero (since it's neutral) but the outer surface has +q. Wait, no, no— the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q so that the total conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. Wait, no, wait. The conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q (due to the +q in the cavity), and the outer surface must have a charge of +q, so overall, the conductor's charge is zero.

But wait, no, because the conductor itself is neutral, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must add up to zero. If the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner has -q.

Now, the electric field outside a conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point outside, like point P, the electric field would be due to the total charge outside the point. Wait, no, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if the +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the question says the point P is outside the spherical conductor. So the conductor's radius is R, and P is at distance L from the center. So the field at P is due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. 

But wait, is the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution affected by where the cavity's charge is placed? Like, if the cavity is off-center, would the outer surface's charge distribution change? Hmm, I think so. Because the inner surface's charge depends on the position of the charge inside the cavity. But for the outer surface, as the conductor is overall neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q (since the inner surface is -q and the conductor was neutral). So the outer surface's charge is +q, but where is it located?

Wait, I think the conductor's outer surface's charge will arrange itself such that any external electric field is uniform. But in this problem, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the inner surface has a charge of -q, but the outer surface would have +q. But how is this +q distributed?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The conductor's total charge is zero. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor is neutral, the sum is zero. So the outer surface has +q, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. 

Wait, but the position of the charge inside the cavity could affect the distribution of the inner and outer charges. Or does it? No, I think that the inner surface's charge is induced to be -q, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity. Because the conductor's inner surface must cancel the electric field inside the conductor's material. So the inner surface's charge is just -q, regardless of where the +q is in the cavity. But the outer surface's charge is +q, regardless of that as well. 

But wait, the outer surface's charge distribution would depend on the shape of the conductor and any external fields. But in this problem, there's no external field mentioned. So the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is a sphere, leading to the charge being uniformly spread. Or wait, is it?

Wait, no. Because the inner surface isn't uniformly charged. Because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. The inner surface's charge is induced such that the conductor's material is shielded. So if the cavity's charge is off-center, the inner surface's charge would be such that the field inside the conductor is zero. But for a spherical conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside, the inner surface's charge would arrange to cancel the field in the conductor. But in this case, the conductor is a sphere, so the inner surface's charge must be arranged in a way that the field from the inner charge (the +q in the cavity) and the inner surface's charge (-q) results in zero field in the conductor.

Wait, but for a spherical cavity, if the charge is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution would not be uniform. So the inner surface's charge would have a dipole-like or other distribution. Hmm, but regardless, the outer surface's charge would still be +q, because the conductor is neutral. 

But wait, for a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the external field as if all the charge were at the center. So the electric field outside the conductor due to the outer surface's charge would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L²) ), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor. 

Wait, but wait, in this problem, the point P is outside the conductor, at distance L from the conductor's center. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, the outer surface's charge is +q, and the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L² ). 

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L² ). 

But wait, what about the other options? Let's check. 

Option A has (l - s cosθ ) squared in the denominator. Hmm, but l is the distance from P to the cavity center. How would that relate to the conductor's properties?

Alternatively, perhaps the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the cavity is off-center. So the field from the outer surface is as if it's at the center, but maybe I'm missing something about the field from the inner charge.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so any point outside that (L>R) will see the field as if the charge is at the center. So the field would only depend on L, not on where the charge is inside the cavity. That's because the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, and the field outside is purely due to that.

So the correct answer would be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L² )

But wait, let me think again. What if the outer surface's charge distribution is affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity? So in reality, the outer surface's charge is not a point charge at the center but perhaps distributed in a way that depends on the inner arrangement.

Hmm, but I remember that for a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform if there's no external field. But in this case, the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge isn't uniform, but the outer surface's charge would still be uniform, right? Because any external fields would have to be considered, but in this case, there's no external field mentioned. So the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly, making the electric field outside the conductor as if it's a point charge at the center, regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

So yes, the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L² ), which is option B.

Wait, but another possibility: the charge inside the cavity creates an electric field, but since the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface's charge (-q) cancels the field inside the conductor. So the field inside the conductor is zero. But the field outside is just due to the outer surface's charge (+q) at the center. So yes, the answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution in the Conductor**:  
   - The conductor is initially neutral, so its total charge is zero.  
   - When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material.  
   - Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor.  
   - The outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is as if this charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.  
   - The position of the charge inside the cavity does not affect the distribution of the charge on the outer surface, as the conductor ensures that the field outside depends only on the total charge and the geometry of the conductor.

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**:  
   - Point $P$ is outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.  
   - The electric field at $P$ is due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, which is distributed uniformly.  
   - The field is given by the formula for the electric field of a point charge:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
     \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is unrelated to the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the formula for the electric field outside a spherical conductor due to its total charge.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. This expression depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While it resembles the formula for a point charge, it incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from $P$ to the cavity center) instead of $L$ (the distance from $P$ to the conductor's center).

### Final Answer:
The electric field at point $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**.
