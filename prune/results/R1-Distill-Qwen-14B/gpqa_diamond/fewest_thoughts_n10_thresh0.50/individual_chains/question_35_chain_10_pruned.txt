Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. 

Wait, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, right? And c is h/(4π), which I remember is a common constant in angular momentum calculations. Oh, and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So, first things first, maybe I should write down what the matrix Ay looks like. Since Ay = c * S, substituting c = h/(4π), each element of S gets multiplied by that. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so Ay would be [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. Let me simplify that. Factor out h/(4π), maybe write it as (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. 

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, finding eigenvalues is straightforward. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0. 

Let me compute that. The matrix Ay is:

[ 0,      -i c ]
[ i c,      0 ]

Where c = h/(4π). So the matrix is:

[ 0,          -i c ]
[ i c,         0 ]

The determinant of (Ay - a I) is:

| (-a)      (-i c)      |
| (i c)      (-a)       |

So the determinant is [(-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c)] = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

Let me compute (-i c)(i c). 

(-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (c^2)(-i * i) )= c² * (1) because i * i is -1, but with the negatives from (-i) and (i), so (-i)(i)= - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (c^2)*1 = c². 

Wait, so the determinant becomes a² - c². So the characteristic equation is a² - c² = 0. So a² = c², so a = ±c. 

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues a are c and -c. Since c is h/(4π), that makes the eigenvalues h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

But let me look at the options. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but wait, the eigenvalues I found are purely real, right? Because a can be ±c, which is real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, no imaginary parts. So that would suggest that the imaginary
