Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The problem states that we're dealing with a muon, but I think that might not matter here since the operator is the main focus. The operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is an arbitrary vector n lying in the x-z plane. So, n is in the x-z plane, which probably means that the angle θ is measured from the z-axis or something like that. Wait, in spherical coordinates, I think the x-z plane would mean that φ is 0 or π, right? Because usually, φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if n is in x-z, then φ would be 0, meaning it's along the x or z direction?

Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. So it's some direction that's a combination of x and z. So maybe the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ is zero. So the direction vector n is (sinθ * cosφ, sinθ * sinφ, cosθ) which, with φ=0, becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n is along the x-z plane, meaning it's in the x-z direction.

The operator P is a vector operator, so I'm guessing it's constructed from its components P_x, P_y, P_z. The eigenvalue equation for the operator P·n would be (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So P·n is the operator in the direction of n.

Wait, but the operator P is a vector operator, so each component P_x, P_y, P_z is a 2x2 matrix. The problem gives each component multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So all these are 2x2 matrices. The operator P·n would
