Okay, so I have this problem here about quantum mechanics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So the question is about a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position of the particles, none were found for x less than 1 and x greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh wait, because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must add up to 1. So normalization is key here.

The wave function given is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, usually wave functions are complex, but here it's written as a combination of a real term and an imaginary term. I think that's correct because wave functions can have both real and imaginary parts.

But wait, when you calculate the probability density, you take the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So that would be the integral of [Ψ*(x) Ψ(x)] dx over the region where the particle exists, which is x from 1 to 3.

So the first step is to compute the square of the absolute value of Ψ(x). Let's write that out.

Ψ(x
