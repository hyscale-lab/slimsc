Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transiting probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transits are when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses are known, but in this case, their masses are the same. I think that might not affect the transit probability directly.

The key factors for transit probability are the orbital period, the size of the star, and the size of the planet. But wait, the planet's size isn't mentioned here, so maybe it doesn't matter because both are Earth-like. Alternatively, maybe the star's size is a big factor.

Wait, the transit probability is calculated based on the geometry of the system. The formula I vaguely remember is P_transit ≈ (R_star / a) * (something), where a is the semi-major axis. Or more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), right? Because the planet has to be in the right part of its orbit for us to see the transit.

But wait, no, I think the probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the planet's orbit. So P = (R_star / a) * (something else). Alternatively, the approximate formula I think is P ≈ (R*/a) * (1), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability depends on the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. The probability that the orbit is aligned such that a transit occurs is proportional to (R*/a) / (1/(2π)) ), but I'm probably mixing some terms here.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (some factor depending on the star's position in the sky), but perhaps more accurately, it's the ratio of the area where the planet's shadow can fall relative to the entire orbit's possible region.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something). Oh right, I think the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (R_star / a), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1/(something else)). Wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (M_planet / M_star)), but that's for the radial velocity method.

Wait, no, perhaps the transit probability is just (R_star / a), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability can be approximated as (R*/a) * (1 + (M_p / M*)) ), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Or maybe it's (R*/a) multiplied by the impact parameter, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try to look this up mentally. Oh right, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So P = (R*/a) * (something? Or just that ratio). Alternatively, the probability is (R*/a) divided by (something else
