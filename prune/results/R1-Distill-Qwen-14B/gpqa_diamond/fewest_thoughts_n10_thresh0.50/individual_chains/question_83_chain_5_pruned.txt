Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem. So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized and also at the equivalence point.

I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Oh, right, because concentration times volume should stay the same (molarity formula: M = moles/volume). So, the initial moles of acetic acid are important here.

Wait, wait. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Right, because 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001.

Then, when we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is moles / total volume. Moles are 0.001, volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is between CH3COOH and NaOH. The reaction equation is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid to produce the acetate ion.

The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let's think: the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So, at this point, 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been converted to CH3COO^-.

So the remaining moles of CH3COOH would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of CH3COO^- produced are 0.00025 moles.

But wait, when we add NaOH, the volume of the solution increases. How much? Let's see. We have the initial diluted solution of 40 cm³, and at 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed for 25% reaction.

The volume of NaOH needed to neutralize 0.00025 moles is moles divided by concentration. NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total solution volume at 25% titration is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of concentrations rather than moles. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation because we have a buffer solution at 25%
