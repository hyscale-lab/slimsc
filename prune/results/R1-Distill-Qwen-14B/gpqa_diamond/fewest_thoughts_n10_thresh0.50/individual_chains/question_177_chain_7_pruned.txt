Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Then, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. 

The task is to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says they appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, same λ_max implies same T, right? So that would mean T1 = T2.

But wait, how does that make sense when the masses and radii are different? Oh, but maybe because of other factors. But according to the problem, the stars are radiating as black bodies, so I think that's the way to go.

So if T1 = T2, then the temperatures are the same. So now, let's calculate the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4)/(R2² T2^4) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the second term is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait a minute. How can that be
