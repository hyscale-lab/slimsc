Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, looking again, I think I misread that. Let me parse it correctly. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like -λ f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f. I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure, but what's important is that the boson X is interacting with fermions through this term.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of the boson. Because in decay processes, the mass of the parent particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the daughter particles' masses (if any). So, if X is 6 GeV, the fermion pairs must each have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Now, let me list the possible fermions. The Standard Model fermions are quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t), leptons (e, mu, tau, and neutrinos). But neutrinos are negligible in mass, so I can probably ignore them for this purpose.

Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, X is interacting with which fermions? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which I think refers to all the fermions, but perhaps the interaction is only with certain types. Hmm, the Lagrangian given is a bit unclear. Wait, wait, the term is written as -λ f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, perhaps the interaction is with a specific fermion, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says it's the interaction between X and fermions. So perhaps X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, given that their masses are low enough.

But wait, perhaps the interaction is only with specific fermions. Because the interaction term may have a coupling that depends on the type of fermion. Let me think again. The Lagrangian is written as:

L = -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

Wait, perhaps f is a Yukawa coupling? Or maybe that's a typo and it's supposed to be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written in a way that each fermion type has its own coupling. But I'm not sure. Either way, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that X can interact with any fermion, so the question reduces to which fermions have masses such that 2m_fermion <= 6 GeV.

Wait, but for each fermion pair, the sum is twice their mass. So the maximum mass of a fermion that X can decay into is 3 GeV because 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So now, I'll list the fermion masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.511 MeV (negligible)
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV (current quark mass)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (current quark mass)
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way higher than 3 GeV)

Wait, but wait a second. The current quark masses are the masses of the free quarks, but when they are bound in hadrons, their effective masses can be higher due to binding energy. But in this case, we're considering the decay of X into fermions, so perhaps in this context, the rest mass of the fermion is considered as the current quark mass, but I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps in particle physics, the masses considered are the actual rest masses of the particles, not the constituent masses. For example, the muon is about 105 MeV, tau about 1.777 GeV, etc. Quarks have much lighter current masses. But I'm not certain about this point, so maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the fermion masses are their pole masses (physical masses).

Wait, but for the purpose of kinematic decay, we only care about the sum of the fermion masses. So let's list the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, considering that each fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV.

So, let's list the possible fermion species and their masses:

- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV → 0.000511 GeV → sum is ~0.001 GeV: way below 6 GeV.
- Positron decay is possible, but in this case, X can decay into e+ e-.

- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV → 0.1057 GeV. Sum is 0.2114 GeV: allowed.

- Tau (tau): ~1.777 GeV. Sum is 3.554 GeV: which is more than 3 GeV, so 2m_tau = ~3.55 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV is more than 3.55 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 2 * m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Quark pairs:

- u quark: ~2.2 MeV → 0.0022 GeV. 2m = 0.0044 GeV → allowed.

- d quark: ~4.7 MeV → 0.0047 GeV. 2m = 0.0094 GeV → allowed.

- s quark: ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV. 2m = 0.19 GeV → allowed.

- c quark: ~1.27 GeV. 2m = 2.54 GeV → allowed.

- b quark: ~4.7 GeV. 2m = 9.4 GeV → which is larger than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b quarks.

- t quark: ~173 GeV → way too heavy.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c. But wait, the problem states that the boson X's mass is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where 2m_fermion ≤6 GeV can be produced. So for quarks:

- c quark: 2m_c = 2.54 GeV → allowed.

- b quark: 2m_b = ~9.4 GeV → not allowed.

So X can't decay into b quarks because their combined mass (9.4 GeV) is greater than X's mass (6 GeV). Same for top quarks, but their mass is way over.

So possible fermion pairs:

- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-
- tau+ tau-
- u ubar
- d dbar
- s sbar
- c cbar

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the tau. 2m_tau is approximately 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Similarly, for the quarks, c quarks have 2m_c about 2.54 GeV, which is allowed. So c cbar is allowed.

But what about the bottom quarks? 2m_b is 9.4 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so decay into b quarks is not allowed.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X → b bar b, s bar s, u bar u, d bar d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, 2m_b is 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b and anti-b. So option A is incorrect, because it includes bbar b decay which is not allowed.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, 2m_c is 2.54 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed. So c cbar is allowed. So option B includes c cbar.

But wait, in the given Lagrangian, does X interact with c quarks? The problem states that the interaction is with fermions, so I think we assume that X can interact with any fermion, but only if their mass allows.

So the allowed decays would include any fermion pair (quark or lepton) where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Therefore, the possible fermions that X can decay into are:

- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-
- tau+ tau-
- u ubar
- d dbar
- s sbar
- c cbar

So the possible decay channels are X→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

So X→c cbar is allowed, so B includes that.

Option C includes t tbar, which is impossible because 2m_t is 346 GeV, way higher than 6, so C is out.

Option D includes bbar b, which is not allowed.

So the allowed decays are:

e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all of these except t tbar, which is not an option. Let me check the options again.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones except for the bottom quarks. So Option B is correct.

But wait, let me make sure. Does X have enough mass to decay into c quarks? 2m_c is about 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6. So yes.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the decay is only possible if the combined mass of the fermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). This means \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or equivalently, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1270 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2540 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4700 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9400 \, \text{MeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9400 \, \text{MeV} > 6000 \, \text{MeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173000 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346000 \, \text{MeV} \) (not allowed).

### Allowed Decay Channels:
