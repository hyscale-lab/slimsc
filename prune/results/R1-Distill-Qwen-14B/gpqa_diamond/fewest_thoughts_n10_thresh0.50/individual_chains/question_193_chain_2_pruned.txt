Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I think I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how the number of stars depends on that distance.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax in astronomy is measured in parsecs, right? The formula I remember is parallax (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / d, where d is the distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, if the parallax is smaller, the distance is larger. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

But the question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about the number as a function of distance. It says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range? So the question is about the change in number as you move a certain distance. Hmm, I think maybe they're asking about the density of stars along the line of sight as a function of distance.

Another approach: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface density times the area of the shell. But wait, wait. Let me think in terms of solid angle. Or perhaps it's considering a region of the sky, so the number of stars in a small volume around d.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number. So if N is the number of stars, and it's proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. That's a big increase with d. But the number of stars usually decreases with distance because they are farther
