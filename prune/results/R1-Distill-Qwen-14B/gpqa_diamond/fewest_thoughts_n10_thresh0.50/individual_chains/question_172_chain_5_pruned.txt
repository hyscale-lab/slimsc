Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, I think that means the excitation level is higher in star_1. Oh right, so the population of the higher energy state is higher in star_1.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, that's probably the value of ΔE. I remember that the excitation energy relates to the probability of electrons being in higher energy levels.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I should use the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by kT.

So the formula is N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but wait, E2 is higher than E1, so it's actually exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2-E1.

In this case, in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So for star_1, N2/N1 is 2 times that of star_2. Let me clarify: if star_1 has N1_1 and N1_2, and star_2 has N1_2 and N2
