Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a product formed after a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what Compound X is first and then see what happens when it reacts.

The data given includes IR and NMR spectra. Let's start by analyzing the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1.

The big absorption between 3400 and 2500 suggests the presence of an -OH group or maybe an alkyne. Wait, wait, the broad peak in IR usually indicates an -OH. But wait, sometimes alkenes or alkynes can also have those regions. Let me think. The OH stretch is usually around 3200-3600, but if it's a broad peak, it's likely an -OH. Alternatively, perhaps an amine, but that's less likely without other peaks. So possible that there's a carbonyl group too.

The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong one, which is a good sign of a carbonyl. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or maybe an amide. But given the other peaks, let's see.

The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests an aromatic ring is present. So the compound has an aromatic ring, possibly with substituents, and a carbonyl group, and perhaps an -OH group.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an -OH proton. Because in D2O, the OH would exchange and not show up, but assuming this isn't exchanged, it's likely an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have an -OH, which is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe an enol form, but that's less
