Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, given some parameters. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

So, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

Wait, but both have the same mass. Oh, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Hmm, so Planet_1 is closer to its star because the orbital period is shorter. Because I remember Kepler's third law: the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if Planet_1's period is P, Planet_2's is 3P. So for Planet_1, (P)^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a^3. Since M is the mass of the star, and m is the planet mass (which is same for both), but since M is much larger than m, we can approximate M as the star's mass. So for Planet_1, a is proportional to (P)^(2/3) over M^(1/3). Wait, no, let me get that right. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³ for a planet around a star. So, a³ = G*M * P² / (4π²). So a is proportional to (P^(2/3)) * (M)^(1/3). 

Wait, but for the transit probability, I think the key factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. The probability of a transit is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a). Because when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, which is needed for a transit, the probability is about (R_star / a), where R_star is the star's radius. 

But wait, let me think. The probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximated as R_star / a. So the probability is proportional to R_star / a. 

So, for each planet, I need to calculate
