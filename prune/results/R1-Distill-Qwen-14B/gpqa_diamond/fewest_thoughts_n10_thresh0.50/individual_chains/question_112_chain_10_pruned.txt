Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Let me break it down.

First, the state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, since it's proportional, I guess I'll need to normalize it. So the first step is to find the normalization constant.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. Let's compute |1+i|^2. That's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Then |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix since it's dealing with spin up and down. Let me write it out.

The matrix would be:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, because if i≠j, the element is hbar/2, else 0. So for a spin-½
