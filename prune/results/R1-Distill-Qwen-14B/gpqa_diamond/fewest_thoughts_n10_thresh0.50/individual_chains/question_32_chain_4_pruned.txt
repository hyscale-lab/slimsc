Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic speeds. The speed v is 0.96c. I remember that for relativistic particles, the energy isn't just the rest mass energy. I need to use the relativistic energy formula. 

The total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, because gamma accounts for the effects of relativity at high speeds.

Wait, but the question asks for the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so each ion (nucleus) would have kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy? Or is it the total energy? Hmm, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually mean the kinetic energy per particle, but sometimes it might refer to the total energy. I need to clarify this.

Wait, no, more accurately, the energy in colliders is often given as the total energy (relativistic energy) because they collide particles at high energies. So each nucleus will have E = gamma * m * c², so that's the total energy. But wait, the problem statement asks for the "energy of the RHIC" so that the speed is 0.96c. So probably, that's the total energy.

So, okay, let's proceed. First, calculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²). Given v = 0.96c.

So (v/c)² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Take the square root of that:
