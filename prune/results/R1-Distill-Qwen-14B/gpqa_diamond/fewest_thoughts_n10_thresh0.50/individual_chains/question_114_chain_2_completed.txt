Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let me start by looking at each reaction separately.

First reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, which is a nitrile source, I think this might be a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Oh wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So maybe it's like a cyanide adding to the carbonyl group.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on the fourth carbon, and the hydroxy is on the second, which is also a methyl group. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents are on the second carbon.

Wait, but starting from butan-2-one: (CH3)2CO. If we add NaCN, which has CN- as a nucleophile. The carbonyl group will react with CN- in a nucleophilic addition. So the CN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a negative charge which picks up a proton. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's not right because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons with the ketone in the middle. So adding CN would add to the carbonyl, making (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? Because the chain is three carbons long. But the product given is butanenitrile, four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Because NaCN in a basic condition can act as a source of CN- which might do an SN2 reaction. But butan-2-one is a ketone, and in such a position, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe it's a substitution where the leaving group is replaced by CN.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If the alpha hydrogen is abstracted, perhaps leading to a conjugate base. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure: the nitrile group is at the end, and on the second carbon, there's a hydroxyl and methyl groups. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN.

Ah, so the starting ketone is (CH3)2CO, and the product adds a CH2CN group to the alpha position. So perhaps it's a cyanohydrin formation. Oh right, cyanohydrin! When a ketone reacts with CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of CN- on the carbonyl, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, then protonation and elimination of water to form the alcohol and nitrile group.

So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. For that, the conditions are usually an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ (as in option A), or perhaps H2SO4. So reagent A would be something acidic, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So which is correct?

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ would form the cyanohydrin, which is the product here. So yeah, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is H2O) to give the corresponding acid. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group in the same carbon, and a benzyl group attached.

Wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Let me see: the butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the second carbon has a hydroxyl and a 4-benzylphenyl group. So the structure is (PhCH2C6H4)C(OH)CH2CN?

Wait, but the reaction is with B (H2O). So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Since the starting material is a nitrile with a neighboring hydroxyl group, maybe it's undergoing hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but nitriles hydrolyze to amides under certain conditions, and to carboxylic acids under others. The presence of a hydroxyl group might influence this.

Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, H2O and H+ can protonate the nitrile, making it more electrophilic. Then water attacks, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by elimination of NH3 and further hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

But in this case, the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The presence of H2O as B suggests that it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Looking at the product: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) becomes a COOH group. So that's the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

What reagents are needed for that hydrolysis? For acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, you would typically use H3O+ (like H2SO4 and heat). But the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, the problem says that B is H2O. So the reagents used are H2O plus another reagent. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis using an acid as the catalyst.

In the first reaction, A is H3O+ (proton source), leading to the formation of cyanohydrin. In the second reaction, B is H2O but with an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH. So for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid.

Which of these would be a suitable acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid?

Typically, concentrated H2SO4 is used, but in the options, HCl is provided. Alternatively, when I've read about nitrile hydrolysis, sometimes HCl is used with H2O, especially in the presence of a catalyst like AgCl (like the Stephen reduction). Wait, but that's for converting nitriles to amines. Alternatively, hydrolysis of nitriles can be done with H2O and HCl, perhaps under reflux.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done using a strong acid. For example, using H2SO4 and water. But the options given are HCl or acetic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis using HCl as the acid, which acts as a catalyst. So when the nitrile reacts with water in acidic conditions (like HCl), it can hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

But wait, another possibility: if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps it's a way to form a ketone via elimination, but that's not what's happening here. The product is a carboxylic acid, so it's a hydrolysis.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl as well.

Wait, but let's recap. The first reaction's reagent A needs to be H3O+; that points to options A or B. Because options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I don't think is relevant for the cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, wait. Another thought: NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to ketones or aldehydes, but that's under specific conditions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, sodium bisulfite is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce ketones or aldehydes via a pathway involving the formation of an intermediate like a sulfonamide or something else. Alternatively, it can be used as a mild acid.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst. If the first reagent A is NaHSO3 (like in options C and D), which is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- can act as an acid), then perhaps that's sufficient. So if A is NaHSO3, that would provide the necessary H+ for the cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, but I thought that H3O+ is more of a typical acid catalyst here. However, NaHSO3 in solution would release H+ because HSO3^- is a weak acid. So maybe either could work.

Wait, but let me think: in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So if A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- (but the H+ is what matters here). So it's possible that NaHSO3 could act as an acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

So maybe the correct option is D, where A is NaHSO3 and B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but then the second reaction would have B as CH3COOH. For the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid, would that require a strong acid or a weak one?

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid generally requires strong acid conditions. For example, with H2SO4 and heat. So if B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, perhaps it's not strong enough. Alternatively, HCl is a strong acid, which would facilitate the reaction.

So in that case, B would need to be HCl. Looking back, which options have B as HCl? Options A and C.

If A is H3O+ (option A), and B is HCl (option A), that would fit. Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3 (option C), which could provide H+ for the first reaction, and B is HCl for the second.

Wait, but the first reaction may require H+ as a catalyst. So NaHSO3 would provide H+ (since NaHSO3 → Na+ + H+ + SO3^2-). So perhaps either H3O+ or NaHSO3 could work as the acid for the cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, but in the reaction with NaCN, what's the exact condition? I think that the cyanohydrin formation typically uses a dilute acid, maybe H2SO4 or H3O+.

So if the first reaction uses H3O+ (option A or B), and the second uses HCl (option A or C), then the correct option would be A.

Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if the first reaction (cyanohydrin) uses H3O+ (A), and the second reaction (nitrile → acid) uses HCl (B), then option A is correct.

Alternatively, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid, then the second would need HCl. So option C would have A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure whether NaHSO3 is a suitable acid for the first reaction.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction involves a ketone and NaCN. The typical reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group, which requires an acid catalyst. So H3O+ would be a strong acid, but perhaps NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, could also work. But I'm not certain whether it's commonly used for this.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is done in a basic condition. Wait, no, because NaCN would provide CN- as a nucleophile, and the ketone is a good electrophile. So the reaction needs acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic.

So whether the acid is strong or weak depends on the reaction conditions. I think that H3O+ is a better acid catalyst for this reaction.

Therefore, if A is H3O+, then the second reaction must have B as HCl. So option A would have A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

But wait, looking at the product of the first reaction, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin. So the formation is correct under acidic conditions.

So for the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid with water and an acid. So strong acid, like HCl, would be needed. So B is HCl.

Thus, the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

But I'm not sure if the first reaction uses H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let me think of any other possibilities.

Wait, another possibility: the first reaction's A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-. Perhaps this could also act as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. But is it a common reagent for this purpose? I'm not very sure. Alternatively, maybe the first step uses aqueous HCN with an acid, but I think in the presence of NaCN and acid, HCN is formed.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- in solution, and when H3O+ is present, the solution is acidic. So that's why in the first reaction, the conditions are acidic.

So, I think the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Option C is A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent for that is B, which is H2O, but with some acid. So perhaps the acid is HCl. So if option A is correct, then the second reaction uses HCl as the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps in the second reaction, the acid is not HCl but something else. Wait, but the options only give B as H2O and the other reagent as HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is not a hydrolysis but an oxidation. Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions with H2O.

Alternatively, the reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to amide, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, for the second reaction, which reagent would facilitate the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Option A: B=HCl. So HCl in water would create an acidic environment, which is suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Option C: B=HCl as well, but A is NaHSO3. So if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as A, which is an acid, that's possible.

So perhaps the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But I'm not entirely sure because I'm a bit confused about whether NaHSO3 could be used as the acid in the first reaction.

Alternatively, another thought: perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as a source of H+ and S for the formation of a sulfonamide or something else. Wait, no, I don't think that's the case. The cyanohydrin formation is straightforward: acid (like H3O+) catalyzes the addition of CN- to the ketone.

So if the first reagent is H3O+, which is option A, that's correct. Then the second reagent is HCl, making option A the correct choice.


To determine the suitable reagents for the given reactions, let us analyze each reaction and the options provided:

### Reaction 1:  
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, confirms that the reaction proceeds via this mechanism.  

- **Reagent A** must provide an acidic environment.  
  - **H₃O⁺** (option A) is a strong acid and commonly used for this purpose.  
  - **NaHSO₃** (options C and D) can also provide H⁺, but it is less commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.  

Thus, **H₃O⁺** is the most suitable reagent for the first reaction.

### Reaction 2:  
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions.  

- **Reagent B** must act as a strong acid catalyst in the presence of water.  
  - **HCl** (options A and C) is a strong acid and suitable for this reaction.  
  - **CH₃COOH** (options B and D) is a weak acid and may not provide sufficient acidity for efficient hydrolysis.  

Thus, **HCl** is the most suitable reagent for the second reaction.

---

### Conclusion:  
- For the first reaction, **H₃O⁺** (A) is the best choice.  
- For the second reaction, **HCl** (B) is the best choice.  

This matches **Option A**.
