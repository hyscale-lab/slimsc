Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, okay, let's start by breaking down what the question is asking.

The problem says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core reactions are all about energy production, right? The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of energy in the Sun. Oh right, the pp chain has a few branches. I remember the main ones are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch produces different elements along the way.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp chain is responsible for producing a lot of high-energy neutrinos, especially electron neutrinos. The pp-III branch, I think, is one of the steps where a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-4 nucleus to make carbon-12. If that stops, then that particular part of the chain isn't contributing anymore.

But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the pp-III branch stopping affects the production of neutrinos in these bands.

I recall that the dominant neutrino emission from the Sun in the MeV range comes from two main processes: the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction and the main pp chain. The pep reaction emits higher-energy neutrinos compared to the main pp reactions. Wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think again. In the pp chain, the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. That neutrino has lower energy, around 0.5 MeV maybe. Then, there are other steps, like the ones in the different branches.

Oh wait, the pp-III branch is a part of the main pp chain. So, when the pp-III stops, the overall rate of the pp chain would decrease, right? But all other reactions remain as they were. So, maybe the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active.

Wait, but the problem says only the pp-III branch stopped. So, the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) and any other reactions (like the CNO cycle) continue as before. Hmm.

So, neutrinos
